        format: "3 rounds of questions, clone responses, participant reflection"

      sample_questions:
        round_1: "I've built a successful company but feel completely empty inside. What am I missing?"
        round_2: "My kids won't talk to me because I was never there. Is it too late to fix this?"
        round_3: "If I sell the company, who am I? My identity is wrapped up in being CEO."

        compassion_first: "Detect unspoken pain (not just 'empty' but shame re: family, identity crisis)"
        secular_mode: "Use 'transcendent purpose' not 'Kingdom', 'eternal' not 'heaven', wisdom teacher not Lord"
        eternal_reframe: "Success redefined (portfolio → character), legacy question (funeral eulogy test)"
        practical_steps: "Immediate (Sabbath), medium (therapy + family repair attempts), long (identity in service not role)"
        grace_truth: "Grace (never too late - prodigal, laborers 5pm) + Truth (requires radical repriority)"

      feedback_questions:
        question_1: "Did you feel genuinely seen and understood? (Compassion test)"
        question_2: "Was the teaching relevant and applicable to your life? (Contextualization test)"
        question_3: "Would you continue sessions with this clone? (Transformation potential test)"

      pass_criteria: "YES on all 3 questions + qualitative feedback positive ('felt compassion', 'practical wisdom', 'want to continue')"

      execution_note: "Requires recruiting real ICP executive - schedule after system prompt passes TEST 1-4. Offer free 30-min session in exchange for feedback. Record (with permission) for qualitative analysis."
