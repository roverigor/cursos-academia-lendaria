# The Creative Process Behind Big Ideas

A bit of an advanced / high level post for today — I hope this gives you all some ideas and direction :)

Have you ever seen brands like Naval, Mark Manson, Jack Butcher and others just to be consumed by the depth behind their ever-so-simple ideas?

The ideas that make you stop and think, "Damn, I wish I wrote that..."

The ideas that stick in your head for eternity — making you market their brand through word of mouth?

This is also why some books do better than others. Why you have your favorite books that you always recommend to your friends.

It isn't the quality of their writing, it is the quality of their ideas.

The best one-liner tweets are big ideas — but few have actual depth behind them. This is the next step in building a highly authoritative brand. Not just generating good ideas, but developing good ideas into big ideas.

You may have noticed that my newsletters, ideas, and depth/articulation of concepts on the podcast have had a considerable jump in quality. This is due to my creative workflow. Moreso, this is due to me working LESS. I will break it all down here.

Idea Generation

We've talked about this many times. You generate good ideas by consuming good content and noting down what sticks out to you.

Books, podcasts, Twitter threads, articles, audiobooks, and content from those you aspire to be like.

Time must be scheduled for consumption. Instead of thinking of it as consumption — think of it as research.

Content creation is 80% research, 20% creating content. (GOOD content, that is).

The ideas that spark excitement — dopamine — as you are "researching" are the things you should put in your notes. You must get in the habit of writing everything down that sticks out to you.

You must also schedule time for nothingness or no thought. Meditative activities that have the potential of pushing you into a flow state. Self-competition.

Martial arts. The gym. Meditation. Disc golf (been playing this a lot recently). Yoga. Running. Swimming. Sunbathing. Long walks. Nature bathing. Hiking. Etc.

This is more important than you think. "Idea generation" time — or active recovery — takes up much more time in my day than actual focused work does.

Start replacing those negative habits with some of these meditative activities.

While you are doing these activities, better ideas will pop into your head (thank you subconscious mind\!)

Take note of these immediately when they come to mind.

I have a running note in my phone that I call "The Queue" for all of my research notes and ideas that pop into my head as I'm going about my day.

Idea Development

Consumption \= good ideas.

Active recovery \= better ideas.

Now we must develop these into BIG ideas. The ideas that we will be known for. Here's how I do it.

I have scheduled time in my day to go through The Queue.

I personally use Roam Research, but you can use whatever note-taking software you want. Obsidian, Evernote, or Notion are probably your best bet.

There are 2 types of note-taking that I would recommend reading up on. Smart Notes and the Zettelkasten Method.

Personally, I would treat these as training wheels. Over time you will develop your own way of writing, deciphering, and turning your notes into big ideas.

Here is how I have been doing it:

 All of my notes, insights, and ideas are inside The Queue (random notes that have stacked up throughout the week)  
I scroll through and pick something that interests me, or just start going down and organizing them  
I expand on that note with my personal insights and summary of the idea  
Personal insights are experiences I've had with that idea and WHY it is so relevant to my life. The summary is just me expanding on it to get more ideas flowing  
After I have 2-3 paragraphs of information — I read through it and summarize the entire thing as a one-sentence BIG idea  
Then, I add in links to other relevant notes or big ideas and start to go back through The Queue  
I can start the process over again or find things that relate to that big idea to develop it further.

Now, when its time to create content, you have an incredible concept with a lot of depth behind it.

This is how you create a weeks worth of content without trying. Some call this their "second brain" or similar.

What can you do with these big ideas?

Use them as content inspiration or just let them stack up.

I personally write a banger newsletter, write tweets along the way, use the newsletter as a YouTube script, and have those newsletters saved for later when I want to start releasing blog content

Simple Frameworks & Systems

To take this even further, start to combine your big ideas or turn them into frameworks / systems that you can call your own.

"Personal Monopoly" is a big idea from Jack Butcher — the HOW behind this big idea is his framework or system. Now, I haven't taken his course, but I am sure this concept is brought up and broken down in a simple, step-by-step process.

One of my big ideas from the other day was "You can turn negative thoughts, feelings, and emotions into a positive potential outcome in life."

As I was writing out my summary (what) and personal experiences (why), I began formulating a framework (how).

I called it the Conscious Conditioning Process.

I have a newsletter coming out this Friday about it.

I can talk about this process whenever I am asked about "how to deal with negative thoughts and emotions."

I am writing about this in my book.

Hell, I could even create a product on this alone. (People buy systems that get results.)

People will start to attribute this process to me, word will spread, and my brand will indirectly grow because of it.

The frameworks/systems you create, name, and tie to yourself are what you will be remembered for. People will pass these along.

Why? Behavior change.

This is the only thing that matters. "What's" and "why's" are good for content, they grab attention. But people want to implement the "how."

The "what" gets them interested, the "how" gets them results (that they attribute to you), the "why" gets them to take action (because it is emotion based).

If your framework gets them results, they will tell a friend about it. Your name will spread and you will start getting tagged on social media when other people are talking about similar topics.

Creating These In A Productive Way

You should have a product / project you are working on that you can tie all of these ideas back to.

Since this research, nothingness, and idea development time is worked into my days — my current book, future book, and future products are creating themselves.

I let my curiosity guide me to learn and implement new things. Then I just turn them into content quickly.

# The Risk Reversal \- Your Secret Weapon For More Clients & Sales

Landing your first client, increasing your conversion rate, selling more products, and creating a compelling offer is difficult... so I'm going to make it a lot easier on you.

When it comes to selling anything (freelance services, coaching, consulting, digital products, physical products)... specificity matters.

Especially when it comes to your promised result (the things that potential customers care about most. We discussed the Quantifiable End Result inside Your Marketing Strategy In One Sentence.

I will bring you 5 new qualified leads this week \> I will do lead generation for you.  
You will lose 10 pounds per month \> You will lose weight

Any promise you give should be as specific as you can make it. 

This gives the potential customer something quantifiable. Something they can make sense of. It sparks desire.

(Pair this with a unique system to get those results and ding ding you have a semi-incredible offer)

This creates a problem for beginners.

They don't have any results to back these numbers up. It's hard for you to display your value to clients.

There is the traditional "permissionless apprenticeship" approach where you send free work, let them test it out, then start working for them (or get a testimonial in return).

This works, but we can add more firepower to start getting paid. More risk reversal.

If you are confident in the product or service that you offer \- throw a number out there. What do results do you think you can get them?

Let's say for a social media growth service \- 2,000 followers a month minimum.  
How about an email marketing service for coaches \- 5 sales calls booked.  
Fitness coaching? 10 pounds lost in the first month.  
Performance coaching? Reducing the amount of time you work by 2 hours.

Now we are working with something. You should be confident in the numbers that you are throwing out.

If you aren't skilled enough to do this, get better at what you do. Help people for free. Understand their business / life. Dig into their problems and give them the solutions.

Systemize it.

Make it easy to get them results.

But... what happens if you don't get them that result? That's where the risk reversal comes in. Usually in the form of a refund (because they are paying for the result with money, that's the risk).

You can get creative with this. You can offer to work with them a second month for free, work with them until they do get those results, or offer some form of that is worth something. (These work great for coaches).

For social media \- If I don't bring you 2,000 followers this month, you won't pay a cent. (You can even go as far to say that you will pay them an extra $100 on top just for wasting their time... who can refuse that?)  
For email marketing \- If I don't bring you 5 new calendar books this month, I will refund you the cost of service.  
For fitness coaching \- If you don't lose 10 pounds this month, I will work with you until you lose 15 pounds for free.

Not only does this make your offer irresistible, it acts as accountability and gives you real-world experience.

If you don't get results, you don't get paid. So you better get results.  
Now... you will have to set criteria for some of these.

You can't just promise someone to lose 10 pounds, they end up doing nothing to actually get there, and you have to refund them because you didn't set boundaries.

Same goes for email marketing. If they have a dead email list filled with people that are not interested in coaching... it's going to be near impossible to get calendar bookings.

This is why qualification and setting hard criteria works. It holds you AND the client accountable.

You can get creative with all of this and use it for digital products as well. (You will just have to set harder criteria... which is good because it will encourage people to actually use the product).

Simple, no?

Get specific. Add a risk reversal. Make it the forefront of your marketing.

# A Breakdown Of My Previous Twitter Agency

Here is exactly what I did to close 4 clients in 2 weeks at $3500/month a piece.

For those that don't know (and I don't expect many to know), I created a Twitter management / growth agency a while back. It ended up falling apart because my previous partner and I had different interests, we decided to just abandon the idea altogether after 2 months.

The Offer

Here are the components of our offer:

4 tweets a day  
1 thread a week  
$750 monthly budget for paid RTs (guaranteed growth)  
DM management  
Engage with people in the replies

Our guarantee: we make them their money back or we refund them what the difference (if they made $2500, we refund $1000)

Our target market: personal brands with top selling courses (makes it easy to make their money back)

Our USP: My partner and I are both great tweet writers, the people we reached out to can see that. We have "celebrity" credibility.  
How We Delivered

First, we understood how to grow twitter accounts and make sales because we had already done it ourselves.

(Remember that learning how to deliver your service is extremely important. This shouldn't have to be said but it seems like too many people want everything give to them, like in this post, and just expect it to work.)

In reality people have already done this work for you. Its called a Twitter course. You can take a twitter course, systemize it, and turn it into the backbone of your account management offer. This is also how you learn how to grow on Twitter.

Other skills that are required:  
Understanding of personal brands sales process  
Light understanding of copywriting for promotional content  
Proficiency in writing, specifically short form content (tweets) and blog style content (threads)

How we came up with content ideas:  
We got access to their courses and turned it into authority content  
We studied competitors in their niche on Instagram and YouTube and use it as content inspiration  
We had the client fill out an extensive questionnaire asking for their content pillars, topics, tone of voice, likes, dislikes, accomplishments, etc  
We created a swipe file from their top tweets in analytics and reword a lot of them

We would send them a weeks worth of tweets to refine and approve. This would help us understand their voice better over time. We would do the same with threads.

We would schedule the tweets in Hypefury and plug their course once a day under a tweet that we knew would do well and was relevant to their course.  
How We Landed Clients

We closed 80% of the people we reached out to because our offer is very specific, has a great guarantee, and we targeted people that we know had money (top selling course creators).

You can find these by searching for the best sellers on gumroad, or finding coaches / creators that you vibe with on Instagram or YouTube and offer to increase their course sales and build their authority on Twitter.

We followed this outreach method to a T and used a personal video. We recorded ourselves going over the outreach message and talked like normal human beings.

All clients except one closed without a sales call because our offer was that good.  
How Can You Do This?

Study as much Twitter content / courses as possible (like this one with JK Molina or this one with Eddy Quan)  
Practice by growing an account of your own, preferably in the niche / interest area that you would enjoy writing about and has profitable creators in  
Systemize your process for content creation, sales, engagement, and replies  
Write content for others or get on a call with them to give them strategies to get more out of their account  
If you aren't extremely confident in your ability, start out at a low cost and increase it as you get results / testimonials  
Create smaller offers (like $500 for 20 tweets and a thread)

One last thing to note:

Stop trying to make money extremely quickly. All it will do is burn you out. Take your time, have fun with the process, and GET GOOD at what you do.

I know many of you are wanting to start a twitter agency so I hope this helped.

# The Hero Section \- Sales Page Copywriting Part 1

Whats good my friends, over the next few weeks I'm going to break down my personal copywriting framework that has gotten some killer results over the past year or so.

As a prerequisite \- you will need to understand the concepts from these articles:

Your Entire Marketing Strategy In One Sentence (your target, unique mechanism, quantifiable end result) this will be your main focus, but you must understand the articles below as well  
Narrowing Further and The Start of Market Research (understanding your target)  
Market Sophistication, Customer Awareness, and Research (understanding the deep problems and objections of your target)  
Standing Out From The Competition (Your USP)

As you can probably tell... these articles might be making more sense now. They are the foundation of an effective marketing strategy for your offers.

The articles above help you craft an irresistible offer and write irresistible copy. 

The Hero Section

The "hero section" is what everyone sees when they first land on your sales page.

Also \- a sales page is going to be a bit different from a full website. Just keep that in mind. This is for your products/services that you want to sell on a single, high-performing page.

Your job is to unleash MOST of your marketing firepower here.

Your USP  
Your unique mechanism (optional but should be hinted at)  
Your quantifiable end result (what people want for their transformation)  
Your target audience (so they know the message is for them)  
Their deepest, most bothersome problem (start of the transformation)  
Your risk reversal (optional but can be hinted at)

The hero section is EASILY the most important part of your sales page. This is where people will decide if they keep reading.

The Eyebrow

![][image1]

The eyebrow is an option section that goes at the very top of the page \- above the headline.

I use it to:

Call out my target audience (creators, coaches, freelancers, experts, etc.)  
Call out the main problem they are experiencing (consistent monetization)

This will give the reader a little spurt of dopamine and make them thing "hey this is written for me\!"

The Headline

IMPORTANT AS F\*CK

Writing headlines is an art. They grab attention and are the main thing that people read.

I personally use it for:

My USP  
The quantifiable end result  
Getting to that quantifiable end result without X inconvenience  
If you can use numbers, even better

Examples:

Discover How A 24 Year Old Turned A Non Original Business Idea Into $12,500 In Just 3 Days  
Discover The Only Platform You Need To Master Your Mind, Body, and Spirit While Growing a $5,000 \- $10,000 per Month Online Business  
Steal The Proven Strategies, Processes, and Systems That Fuel Multi-Six Figure Social Media Businesses & Cut Your Work Times In Half

The secret to this is piecing together certain parts of your marketing material here.

How can they all fit cohesively in the hero section?

How do they make the most sense in your eyebrow, headline, and deck?

The Deck

Your deck (some people call it a subheadline) gives people a taste about what to expect when they continue reading \- it's supposed to build desire and make them WANT to continue reading.

This is where you try to fit the marketing firepower that you haven't already used in your headline or eyebrow.

Most of the time, I pop part of my USP into it and make it sound juicy and use it to tell them what they will receive if they continue reading.

If you didn't have room for eliminating an inconvenience, add it to the deck.

You can also hint at your unique mechanism here.

Examples:

Get immediate access to the Twitter Lead System and stop worrying about where your next client will come from  
Get step-by-step guidance from a marketing & performance consultant to seamlessly build a $10K+ per month online business (without having to buy another program... for life)

If you have any questions, pop them in the respective Lounge channel.

Start rewriting those eyebrows, headlines, and decks my friends\!

# The Body \- Sales Page Copywriting Part 2 (and intro to PASTOR)

In last weeks article we discussed the The Hero Section of a sales page which includes (or hints at) most of our marketing firepower.

The eyebrow, headline, and deck.

Now \- we have people attention. They know that the page is speaking to them, and they are curious to see how you can solve their problem.

Keep in mind, we are talking about the framework in these articles, not the writing itself. We will talk about that later, but the framework alone can make up for some writing skills.

Initial Social Proof

This part is optional, but after talking with a few freelance copywriters, they swear by this to hold attention from the start.

This part is simple, introduce some of your top case studies / testimonials with a brief explanation of the results they got.

Here is my example from the MMHQ landing page.

This comes right after the deck (or VSL, a video sales letter if you have one)

Squash peoples disbelief early with results you've gotten and build the desire even more.

Introducing The PASTOR Framework

You've probably heard of AIDA (attention, interest, desire, action)... but that is basic and lacks nuance.

It's good, don't get me wrong, but PASTOR does it better (and provides a better formula for longer form content).

Here is an article that goes more in depth.

P \- problem  
A \- amplify  
S \- story \+ solution  
T \- transformation \+ testimony  
O \- Offer  
R \- Response (CTA)

I use this for nearly ALL of my writing, not just sales pages.

Blogs, threads, emails, etc.

The Lead

By far one of the most important parts of your copy aside from the hero section.

Everytime I read good copy, if the lead is very good, I am ready to buy right then in there.

The lead is an accurate description of the problem(s) they are facing right now that you can solve. This is where MUCH of your market research comes into play.

If you can NAIL the readers specific situation, they will be open to hearing what you have to say, if not buy right there.

Your lead should paint a picture of the pressing problem (this is also the P in the PASTOR framework).

You can format your copy however you'd like \- but bullet points that state their current painful situation in detail are always a good move.

You are talking directly to them, making them understand that the position they are in isn't a good one.

You can also include the "A" of PASTOR here, Amplify the problem. Make them understand why they need a change.

Throughout all of this you are both taking into account the market's level of sophistication AND their level of awareness.

If you are promoting a self-improvement product to an incredibly saturated market \- nailing the problem they are having is crucial, because they have probably already tried many self-help books and YouTube tutorials/blogs.

They are more than likely aware of their problem, you just need to jab at it and amplify it.

You can get as creative as you want with how you introduce these bullet points.

On the MMHQ landing page, I labeled them as "traps" that creators, coaches, or freelancers fall into.

Here is how I introduced the lead:

Here are the bullet point problems:

The key to this is getting VERY specific. This is very easy if your target audience is your former self.

Next up \- the body.

The Body

At the start of the body you should have another headline that brings attention to the solution of their problem.

The body is where you start to build a story on how the previous problem was solved. How somebody had this problem and eventually solved it via your product or service.

(This is the first part of "S" in PASTOR, the story. The solution is where you introduce your offer)

Humans love stories. It keeps them hooked and reading if you can write it well.

Beginning \- how the protagonist had the problem you described (paint their life and what it looked like, emphasize reliability, talk about what their actual lifestyle looked like).

Middle \- The turning point and introduction of your unique mechanism.

End \- Their results, we will introduce your offer soon as the solution.

If you do not think you have a story to tell \- you are either lying to yourself or you need to create one.

You can tell:

Your own personal story (works well if you don't have social proof)  
A client success story (hence why I think having consultations beforehand is important)

The story doesn't even need to be a story about a person. You can simply walk them through a hypothetical of where they are now and how they can get to the solution.

Use "what ifs." \- these aren't as powerful, but they are a story nonetheless.

In the story (all of your copy actually), you should take into account the objections the reader has. These should be written down already. Explain how those objections mean nothing by bringing them up and turning them into selling points.

When you are writing your story \- think of how you can word things in a way that will "click" with the reader.

Here is the intro to my body from the MMHQ landing page:

Joey's story fit the strategy to perfection \- especially since he is now a partner of MMHQ. Who wouldn't want to learn from the purple man himself after that transformation?\!

That's about it for this article.

In the next one we will talk about your unique mechanism, offer introduction, call to action, and other parts that will round out your sales page.

If you have any questions, pop em in respective Lounge channels\!

# The Godfather Offer \- A Plug & Play Template

I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse...

Prerequisites for this post:

What You Need To Understand For Your Social Media Business  
The First Thing To Do When Starting an Online Business  
Narrowing Further & Market Research  
Market Sophistication and Customer Awareness  
Your Entire Marketing Strategy In One Sentence

In short: what product/service can you create that aligns with everything we’ve talked about previously?

What fits this strategy to perfection?

What can you create that actually delivers the quantifiable end result for your target?

This is where everything comes together.

Your offer is an exchange of value.

How can you present your offer in a way that is OVERWHELMINGLY valuable in exchange for the asking price?

It’s time to start thinking of your offer in more ways than just a product or service. There is much much more that comes into play here.

Components of an Irresistible Offer

It’s time to start thinking of your offer in more ways than just a product or service. There is much much more that comes into play here.

1\. Pricing

Value based pricing

How do people charge thousands of dollars for a few videos (in a course)? They provide an overwhelming amount of value for the price.

If you can nearly guarantee someone results \- and their PROBLEM is BIG enough, they will pay the price to have your solution.

When crafting the rest of your offer, take competitor prices into account.  
Are you providing more than they are?

Can you offer a lower (but respectable) price?

We also discussed pricing a bit more in this post.

2\. Bonuses

Bonuses can be used in multiple ways \- the main thing is… you need to be able to offer bonuses.

For price negotiation (not directly included in the offer):

If somebody says the price is “too high” or they do not have enough \- do not lower your price. It decreases the value of your offer.

Instead, offer them a relevant bonus (that is not included in the offer) to push them over the edge and get them to buy.

Example: $1500 is too much for a website \- offer them a free landing page valued at $500 to push them over the edge

Included in your offer:

What bonuses, relevant to your main product or service, can you bake into the offer to add higher perceived value?

Let’s say my main product is a web design course… I can offer bonuses like:

An SEO guide so people can get more organic traffic to their site  
A free 30 minute coaching session to help them make use of it  
A Slack or Discord community where buyers can interact  
A website checklist to make it easy for them to create websites

Bonuses will justify your pricing and result in an extremely happy customer.  
Some people buy products solely for the bonus items.

3\. Risk Reversal (Social Proof Included)

What will make the reader understand that there is ABSOLUTELY ZERO RISK from buying from you?

This comes down to a few things.

Payment options (split payments, financing, etc)  
Money back guarantee  
Social proof  
Other proof that shows your offer WORKS  
Guaranteeing QER or else you receive X bonus

We will discuss the Negative Risk concept one of these days in an article format.

4\. Discounts

Discounts should be used sparingly (depending on the platform or method)

Discounts for holidays, special events, and milestones are a good idea \- not much to touch on there.

One thing to take into account is CONTRAST.

You should talk about the true value of your offer compared to the price you are offering it at.

“Coaches charge $2500 for 3 months of hand holding. I am giving you all of the information you need for $47.”

“Realistically, this website would go for $10,000 when designed by a big agency, I am giving you it today for $5000.”

“Everything included in this bundle is worth $449, you get it for $25”  
You get the point.

Use this to your advantage when selling both verbally and written.

Offer Stacking

Offer stacking is an INCREDIBLE way to sell more of your service.

Side note: if you can create a course, you can create a service. You SHOULD create a service.. Whether it's freelancing, coaching, consulting, or all of the above.

Example of An Offer Stack

I am now a freelancer. I charge e-commerce stores $5000/month to implement the Email Domination funnel (random name off the top of my head).

When I am on a sales call with the decision maker of this e-commerce store, they may have objections about the price, OR just not be able to afford it.

SO, I now have a backup offer. I can implement a piece of the Email Domination Funnel for half the price ($5000 one time fee). Rather than the entire funnel, I write specific sequences and hand them off to the store.  
If this is still too much, I can offer consulting for $2500. 8 calls and I teach them how to implement the entire Email Domination Funnel by themselves.  
   
They get all of the value of the $5000/month service at a fraction of the cost.

At this point, $2500 one time fee seems like NOTHING compared to $5000/month.

Example For Coaches

First offer: The Actualization Program ($5000)

Full fledged 3 month program.

Second offer: The Accelerated Program ($2500)

Accelerated 1.5 month program. Same value \+ material, half the time and half the calls (still extremely appealing).

Third offer: The Micro Program ($500)

2 weeks of DM or Telegram access, no calls. You assign them content from the program and talk them through it.

Now, once they go through any of these programs, you can upsell them on a micro coaching monthly retainer. $500/month with little time investment on your end. Let your mind run wild and get creative with this.

As with everything in marketing... this will get better with time, experience, and iteration. Don't get discouraged if you don't get this right the first time.

# Your Entire Marketing Strategy In One Sentence

To make things extremely simple, we are going to turn your entire marketing strategy into a one-sentence description.

This will help you regain clarity when you fall off track.

I learned about this sentence from Dan Henry, but before we dive into what it actually is, we need other parts of our marketing locked down.

Your Ideal Customer

Your ideal customer is the person you would thoroughly enjoy working with. They have more than enough funds to afford your service without being needy or annoying. They "vibe" with you and understand that you are the expert.

You determine your ideal customer through marketing research and reverse engineering a starving market.

This article will help you reverse engineer the market.

This article will help you paint your ideal customer.

Your Unique System

We haven't talked about this much yet \- but your unique system is YOUR method / path / way for getting results.

Remember P90X? Their unique system was "muscle confusion," a completely BS term that spread across the world. (Do this ethically, don't just make shit up like them)

My unique system for social media creators is the Social Matrix.

Many people can show you how to build out a funnel \- but very few people have a system specific to social media that brings an insane amount of traffic (without ad costs).

Whenever you see people promoting a specific method that gets results, that is their unique system.

Somebody that does Facebook Ads for local businesses can have the "local celebrity funnel" which is just a series of ads and landing pages that is spun in a unique way.

That's the thing about this \- it may not necessarily be unique \- but it isn't a generic solution to a burning problem. It isn't a commodity.

One last example for web designers, what is more enticing:

A website that captures more leads  
The Appointment Accelerator (a landing page, lead magnet, and email followups to book appointments for service businesses)

Your Quantifiable End Result (OR Promise)

Think about the transformation that you offer your customers/clients. (That's what marketing / sales is, giving people a solution to a problem \- causing some degree of transformation in their life).

Point A \= where they are now

Point B \= where your product / service can take them (where your unique system will take them.)

Point B is your promise. It is OK if you can't make it absolutely quantifiable.

We want to spice up point B a bit more by making it quantifiable.

When you are thinking about hiring a fitness coach, what is more enticing?

Losing weight for the summer  
Losing 25 pounds in 3 months

Clearly number 2\.

The potential client / customer can visualize number 2\. It's tangible.

Number 1 means they can lose 5 pounds or 50 pounds, it's not specific. Specificity is always better in marketing.

When you're providing a marketing service for a company, what is more enticing?

I will send you qualified leads each month  
I will send you 10 qualified leads per month or I will refund your investment and pay you $100 on top.

Number 2 wins yet again.

Be specific with the outcome that your offer provides.

(This becomes 10x more powerful when you can back it up with social proof and testimonials.)

Your Entire Marketing Strategy In One Sentence

From Dan Henry:

If I can make \[ideal customer\] believe that \[unique system\] is the only way to get \[quantifiable end result\] and the only way to do that is through \[my offer\], then all objections become irrelevant, and they must invest.

Let's plug in an example.

Ideal customer \= creators (that are hovering around $2-$3k/month)

Unique mechanism \= the social matrix and infinity funnel

Quantifiable end result \= $1 per follower per month

Offer \= The Brand Mastery Program

Here is my marketing strategy in one sentence:

If I can make creators believe that the social matrix and infinity funnel is the only way to make $1 per follower per month, and the only way to do that is through the Brand Mastery Program, then all objections become irrelevant, and they must invest.

Once you have this down, it really is all up to your offer.

# Why Your Copy, Promotions, & Sales Calls Suffer

We all know that selling is an emotional game. You have to toy with your potential customer's heartstrings (and for good reason, your product will help them avoid that feeling again).

Negative emotions sell more than positive. Both are useful, but we are providing solutions to a problem that creates those negative emotions.

The more specific you get, the better.

Like telling a story, you want to paint a picture of where their life is now (negative impact of the problem) and where their life will be (solution).

A great way to do this is by breaking it down and understanding the biological root of the problem.

Quite frankly, the potential customer thinks they have a certain problem \- when in reality it is something else.

Here's what you should do.

Step 1: List Out Your Target’s Main Problems

Refer back to what you wrote down for your market research in this previous post.

Take note of what they are struggling with the most and normal pain points within that niche.

Order them from most pressing to least pressing. Which causes them the most emotional pain?

All of these pain points will play a role in our marketing, but the main problem is the most important, and helps you understand your customer more.

Step 2: Discover The Biological Root

Emotions \> Logic

Especially in marketing. People buy results. Results stem from greed and necessity.

Now, we are going to break down the \#1 problem from above and break it down even further (people who are familiar with sales understand the power of this.)

Let’s pretend we are on a sales call here \- I am pitching a Twitter follower on high-performance coaching (self-improvement/productivity stuff).

I get on the call, let him know how it is going to go, ask some questions, and get to this part of the call:

Tell me man, what are you struggling the most with right now? Whats preventing you from reaching X result?"

“Well, it seems like I’ve lost focus during my work and I have a LOT to get done. It is stressing me out.”

In your daily life, what is this costing you? Why does it matter that this work isn’t getting done?

“I’m not able to give the time and energy to my wife and kids at night. I don’t see an end to the work I’m doing.”

(We are getting somewhere here).

What do you think is causing this to happen right now?

“Answers the question”

Is this affecting other people in your life, how?

“Yes, my wife is getting tired of me, my kids are upset, and I haven’t seen my friends in months.”

(Ending up alone is a biological problem/fear.)

What will happen if you don’t solve this problem in 90 ish days?

“I may never talk to my friends again… and who knows, my wife could consider leaving me”

See what we did here? We broke down a surface-level problem of a lack of focus and turned it into something much much deeper, and much more pressing.

What you need to do, is take your \#1 ranked problem and ask questions about it until you get to the root.

Your job is to make them realize what the biological root of the problem is. 99% percent of the time you don't explicitly say it.

Then, you can transition into pitching your solution.

# Offer Creation Part 1 \- Pricing

Let's talk about pricing your offers, both low ticket and high ticket.

Low ticket \= $1000 or less.  
High ticket \= $1000+

Some people consider high ticket $5000+ but for the sake of understanding this, let's stick to \+/- $1000.

The Problem \- Time and Market-Based Pricing

Many freelancers and coaches make the mistake of going with time-based pricing from the start. This almost always causes headaches that you will change down the road... so it's better to just start charging in a better way now.

Info products that are based on the market value of other products also pigeon holes you.

Your pricing should be solely dependent on the return your are bringing the other person \- you need to be able to articulate that value (we will discuss tactics for this later.)

The Solution \- Value-Based Pricing

How do people charge thousands of dollars for a few videos (in a course)? They provide an overwhelming amount of value for the price.

How do people charge $50k for high-level coaching? They solve a $100k problem. The value exceeds the payment

If you can nearly guarantee someone results \- and their PROBLEM is BIG enough, they will pay the price to have your solution.

Many problems within the health/wealth/relationships verticals are big enough to charge big prices. This is why it is very important to follow the steps we've talked about earlier with the customer avatar, market research, unique positioning, etc.

When determining your pricing, take competitor prices into account (but not to match their price, unless it is an extremely similar offer).

Are you providing more than they are?

My twitter/marketing/funnel consulting all in one is much more valuable than a generic online business program \- because it solves a specific (and very pressing) problem and gets a specific type of person results.

What unique strengths do you have that can make your solution more effective? (Think about your USP)

For me \- its twitter. I have leverage and more knowledge than the average person in that area. The main part of my offer is marketing/funnels \- but I can help others drive insane traffic to theirs via Twitter as opposed to ads or other methods.

Can you offer a lower (but respectable) price?

Proceed with caution on lowering your prices as it will attract people looking for a 'deal.'

I would say that this is only useful if your offer is very productized and doesn't take up too much of your time.

Take the SCAMPER method into account.

Read up on the method here.

This takes some creativity, time, and subconscious processing to do right \- don't try to lock this down all in one go.

In short, what parts of your offer can you substitute, combine, adapt, modify, put to other use, eliminate, or reverse to make your offer more enticing?

In future posts, we will discuss other parts of your offer and how everything we've talked about fits together.

If you have any questions so far post it in \#Business Strategy\!

# Offer Stacking For More Sales & Negotiation

What I mean by offer stack is having different tiers/options for your high ticket offer.

Freelance, consulting, or coaching service.

If you don't have a service yet, you should.

Services should come before products because it is easier to iterate and get results. (There is nuance to this. It is dependent on your goals).

By iterating, you are creating your own unique method for getting results (this is important). Your unique system.

THEN, you can package your unique system up into a product and leverage the results / testimonials it has gotten people.

Example of An Offer Stack

I am now a freelancer. I charge e-commerce stores $5000/month to implement the Email Domination funnel (random name off the top of my head).

When I am on a sales call with the decision-maker of this e-commerce store, they may have objections about the price, OR just not be able to afford it.

SO, I now have a backup offer. I can implement a piece of the Email Domination Funnel for half the price ($5000 one-time fee). Rather than the entire funnel, I write specific sequences and hand them off to the store.

If this is still too much, I can offer to consult for $2500. 8 calls and I teach them how to implement the entire Email Domination Funnel by themselves. They get all of the value of the $5000/month service at a fraction of the cost.

At this point, $2500 one time fee seems like NOTHING compared to $5000/month.

Example For Coaches

First offer: The Actualization Program ($5000)

Full-fledged 3-month program.

Second offer: The Accelerated Program ($2500)

Accelerated 1.5 month program. Same value \+ material, half the time and half the calls (still extremely appealing).

Third offer: The Micro Program ($500)

2 weeks of DM or Telegram access, no calls. You assign them content from the program and talk them through it.

Now, once they go through any of these programs, you can upsell them on a micro coaching monthly retainer. $500/month with little time investment on your end. Let your mind run wild and get creative with this.

# Standing Out From The Competition (Your USP)

In short, your USP is what you have that competitors don’t.

Depending on the market, this could be as simple as serving one specific niche. I.E. a web design agency for coffee shops (this probably isn’t a very solid idea, but you get the point, there aren’t many other coffee shop exclusive web design agencies.)

If the market is more sophisticated/saturated with an offer similar to yours \- that’s when we need to get creative.

Answer these questions and choose and start to brainstorm your USP:

What does your product/service have that your competitors dont? (we have not created our offer yet, we will do that in The Godfather Offer)  
Can you provide something exclusive to your target?  
Do you have celebrity credibility in your market? (I.E. you worked with Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and got him into movie shape)  
Do you distribute differently than your competitors? (For digital offers: is the knowledge delivered in a different way?)  
Can you offer lower prices OR higher quality

If you are having trouble brainstorming how YOU are different, here are some examples of successful USPs:

TOMS Shoes \- A child in need gets a new pair of shoes for every purchase you make.

Nerd Fitness \- A fitness website exclusively for “nerds”

Head & Shoulders \- Clinically proven to reduce dandruff

Dominos Pizza \- Hot and fresh pizza delivered to your door in 30 minutes or less  
Piece Together Your USP

Option 1: Take the greatest benefit of your offer and GUARANTEE they will receive that benefit

FedEx example: Guaranteed overnight delivery

(Some people offer overnight delivery but don’t guarantee it)

Agency example: Guaranteed X amount of leads per month or your money back

(This guarantees the client makes more than they spend)

Option 2: Your niche combined with your product/service without inconvenience

You see a lot of freelancers / agency owners / coaches with this: I help \[niche\] get \[results\] through \[product/service\] without \[inconvenience that competitors have\]

Option 3: Throw your unique mechanism at the end of your USP from above as the way you help them achieve their desired result.

# Understanding What We've Learned So Far

This shit can get confusing if we don't understand the purpose behind what I'm teaching. So I want to clear things up.

Most people get this wrong \- and you may still get this wrong the first couple of times \- but that's fine. Iteration is the key to success in all things, especially online business.

The 3 Things I Teach Here:

Audience building \- we haven't touched on this too much yet. BUT our next training is on building a twitter audience taught by 6 figure twitter ghostwriter ﻿JK Molina﻿   
Marketing / Offer creation \- All previous posts in this channel have been about marketing. We want to understand this so we can start off on the right foot and have more time to iterate throughout our journey. (I am teaching this first as it will help start your audience building on the right foot)

This is where most people go wrong. Selling a landing page to a creator won't cut it nowadays. Selling the "Ebook Sales Machine" (a custom made funnel for ebook sellers) is much more enticing \- and you can charge much more.  
Sales / Persuasion \- Selling your offer through social media via DMs and funnels.

There may be more to this, but its not worth focusing on, especially right now.

If you can build an audience, create a half-decent offer, and understand even the basics of sales \- 6 figures/year is not far out of reach given some time.

Hell, if you understand offer creation and sales via DMs, you don't need to build an audience (however I do recommend it, it's digital real estate)

One thing to note: you can use this information Im giving you to become a marketing consultant. A lot of people have crappy marketing. I personally sell what I am teaching you for $4k-$8k to creators.

Where Your Focus Should Be:

Do you have skills/knowledge? Do you understand a skill like landing page design, email marketing, copywriting, etc. well enough to help people improve theirs?

Yes? Craft your offer and start reaching out to people.  
No? Start learning like MAD here or via courses/YouTube/learning platforms.

Have you been in the fitness game long enough to get results for yourself? Want to become a coach? Nobody is stopping you besides yourself.

Same goes for any other form of coaching. Mindset, business, habits, relationships, productivity, anything.

If you understand offer creation/marketing/sales \- you can sell anything to anyone. (Because it genuinely helps them solve a problem.)

Once you understand a tad more than the basics/fundamentals \- START TAKING ON REAL WORLD PROJECTS.

Offer free/cheap work to your target audience. Start building landing pages. Start coaching friends and family. Start writing a book and give it to people. Get your name out there.

That is where your focus should be right now.

If you need any more clarity on this, please don't hesitate to ask your questions in \#Business Strategy.

# Market Sophistication, Customer Awareness, and Research

The final post in our market research series\! This post, along with the last 2, are necessary.

By simply having these in mind you will eliminate most competition. I also have more in the arsenal to eliminate competition further.

Your Target's Market Sophistication

You need to think about your marketing in the right context. You need to be able to pivot your messaging according to the market sophistication.

The 5 stages of market sophistication was coined by Eugene Schwartz, an elite marketer.

Stage 1: Brand new market \- you don’t really need to worry about this one. This is when there is no competition, but this is rare nowadays.

Stage 2: There are some competitors in this market \- but it is easy to stand out with your claims/promises (by being more specific and quantifiable than the rest with your promises/solutions). Chances are you don’t have to worry about this stage either.

Stage 3: More competition and better claims. This is where most markets live, and probably where yours does. Everyone is being bombarded with offers. You need to position yourself correctly (unique selling point and unique machine).

Stage 4: A ton of competition, having unique mechanisms, and large competitors emerge (Gurus, Apple, Tech Companies). You don’t need to worry about this stage too much. At this point you need to get creative with your marketing and show them how it works. You will learn to do this.

Stage 5: This is just a sea of competitors. The loudest and most valuable brands stand out.

It will ALWAYS be better to market to the stage your market is in or HIGHER.

You can determine your market’s level of sophistication by researching in the places we mentioned previously (FB groups, Amazon Reviews, Answer The Public).

The more content/people/amount of offers there are, the more sophisticated your market. Are they excited or tired of the products being pushed to them?  
Your Target's Level of Awareness

There is no “right way” to tweet, write a blog post, or write an email, launch an ad each and every time.

Your goal is to speak to specific people within their given awareness level.

The best way to think about it is by looking at your brand through your target’s eyes.

The Buyer’s Journey \- 5 Stages of Customer Awareness

Stage 1: Unaware. People won’t buy from you here. They don’t know who you are or what you sell. They don’t know they have a problem and that there is a solution for it.

Stage 2: Pain aware. They understand they have a problem but aren’t aware of a solution.

Stage 3: Solution aware. They know they have a problem and that there is a solution but they do not know about your solution.

Stage 4: Product aware. They know about your product but just haven’t bought it yet.

Stage 5: Most aware. People know you and your brand, they trust you. All it takes is a bit of scarcity to push them over the edge (discount or limited time offer).

We talked a bit about this in Solopreneur Foundations with your funnels/email sequences. Your "top-of-funnel" content (tweets, posts, videos) should focus on phases 1-3. Then you work them through your emails/backend funnel to introduce them to your product.

Now is your time to start researching current products/services in the marketplace. Take note of them \- you can use them to create better offers and “steal” ideas from them.

If you currently have an offer, now is the time to think about how you should actually be promoting.

Are you going straight out of the gate asking people to buy in stage 1? Or are you capturing a lead and nurturing it into stage 5?  
Research Your Ideal Customer

Based on your market’s level of sophistication and the majority of your targets’ awareness levels, answer the questions below.

These will be absolutely critical when creating your offer, writing copy, creating social posts, ANYTHING.

Most people shoot in the dark with this stuff, you want to be brutally aware of what your audience/potential customers are going through.

If you can, try to find these answers from REAL people on the internet. If you can’t, well... that's even more reason to start growing an audience or getting active in communities.

Important: Since you are probably looking for clients on social media \- the BEST form of market research is to offer free help in the DMs and get them on a call.

On this call, you can ask the questions below or other questions you have about their life / business. From there, you can give advice and start to make connections to implement in your offer.

Questions to answer about your target:

What is the typical story of this person that would buy what you plan on offering?  
Why do they buy it?  
What is their mindset towards their problem?  
What would make them buy your offer?  
What results do they hope they get?  
What have they done before to solve this problem?

Questions to answer about yourself:

Chances are you are selling something related to what YOU are good at. You may have purchased a similar/related product, or you have had these questions pop into your mind while learning.

The questions below are from Jose Rosado (a previous mentor of mine). Check him out on Twitter @joserosado.

What was your mindset then?  
Why did you buy it?  
What results were you hoping to get?  
What problem of yours were you trying to solve?  
What did you struggle with?  
What were your biggest “aha” moments?  
What were your objections?  
What stopped you from buying?  
What do you wish you had done differently  
What do you hope to do differently?

Answer those questions, save this in your Google drive, and start thinking deeply about your marketing.

# Narrowing Further \+ The Start of Market Research

Preface: brother Torbjørn Husevåg had a great question on the last post that should be discussed here.

Torbs question:

How would you describe the niche market / persona of this community in once sentence? Online solo entrepreneurs interested in financial, mental and physical development? 

My response:

It gets wonky with a personal brand, and this is moreso for fun/community rather than trying to scale and make a shit ton of money

In this case, since my ideas, thoughts, and personality are my main marketing "firepower"

My niche is me.

People that have the same interests, desires, problems that I can help them with through the experience I've gained

I put this text towards the end, "If you are building a personal brand, or theme account \- you need to take audience first vs product first into account. Which we will talk about later. You MAY not want to niche down a crazy amount."

Modern Mastery isn't very niched down, and for that reason \- I either need an audience (which I have) or I need to make it a big name (which I am planning to do)

If you want to start making sales and charging high prices from the start \- that is when this comes into play \- and is what many of my other offers are composed of

This should help today's lesson make more sense.  
Finding Your Target

This is where our research begins and how we find pain points/problems that we can use as firepower for creating a solution and attracting the right people.

Where to research:

Facebook groups: you can join groups in ANY niche. Bodybuilding (health), picking up chicks on Tinder (relationships), marketing for personal brands (wealth)

Start requesting to join some in your niche and pay attention to people that are asking questions (people that need help with specific problems)

Keep a running market research Google doc for all of this. You WILL NOT remember it in your head. Copy and paste everything.

Amazon Reviews: Specifically the books section. There are books on literally EVERY topic in almost every niche.

Find a popular book in your niche and read the 2-4 star reviews. These will tell you what was MISSING from the actual product \- that is how you can make yours better.

Again, write all of this down and start connecting the dots.

1 and 5 star reviews are mostly worthless as they don't give feedback, they are either angry or happy with the product.

Answer The Public: I do not have the most experience in this as I rely on the other methods \+ my audience on social, but it can be very powerful. I would recommend playing around on the website and possibly watching videos on how others use it.

Social Media: Same with facebook groups. Look for questions that people are asking or areas where people are struggling. Facebook groups gives you access to an audience \- this is another reason why building an audience is powerful.  
Painting Your Ideal Customer

Some may know this as a customer avatar \- it is very common in the marketing space because it is necessary.

These are the answers you are trying to find when you are going through the FB groups, amazon reviews, etc.

Copy/paste this into your Google doc and fill out the answers.

Btw, you are not limited to ONE customer avatar. You will be refining, iterating, and creating new ones for different products/services you create.

Age:

Gender:

What is their marital status? (Divorced, married, single, etc.)

Do they have children?

Where do they live?

What is their favorite quote?

What do they do for a living?

What is their annual income?

Did they graduate college?

What are their lifelong goals?

What are their values?

What are they are struggling with right now?

What are their major pain points relating to the niche you chose?

Where do they get their information from?

Books:  
Blogs/websites:  
Gurus:  
Social media:

What are some common objections/limiting beliefs to reaching their goals?

What does an average day look like for them?  
﻿  
﻿  
Specify Your Target

Write out a summary of your target.

Example: John is a 26-year-old college grad that became a financial advisor but he has a very hard time finding/attracting women into his life. He is worried that he is getting too old for the dating market.

This is who you are marketing to. Do not get too caught up on the actual ideal customer \- pay close attention to their deep, biological, and burning problems.

In our next lesson we will talk about market sophistication and levels of customer awareness (this was briefly discussed in the Solopreneur Foundations training, we will dive a bit more in depth here).

# The Start To Finding A Profitable Problem

By now you have probably heard of 'niching down' and targeting a specific group of people. That is what we will discuss.

This is absolutely necessary for any online business (regardless of how much you niche down). You won't be able to target their pain points and present your offer as a solution any other way.

You are also using this to target people you WANT to work with, especially if you are a consultant or freelancer. Life is better when you work with people you enjoy.  
Step 1: Choosing A Market

There are 3 main markets: health, wealth, and relationships.

These are where most profitable problems lie. Think about it... having problems in these areas are human nature.

BUT, you can't just solve the "wealth" problem as a whole.

"I will help you acquire wealth" sounds nice, but we need to get more specific, especially since we are solopreneurs, not huge corps.

Start with a market you have experience in or are interested in exploring.

We will choose health for this example.

Note: there are other markets. But, I do not have experience in them nor do I think they serve the purpose of this group.  
Step 2: Choosing A Submarket

For our health market, here are some example submarkets:

Resistance training  
Nutrition  
Yoga  
Mobility  
Medical fields

Again, choose one that you have experience in or are interested in.  
Step 3: Niche Market

Now, we narrow down further (this makes it easier to research, find specific problems, and create specific solutions)

Examples of niche health markets:

Bodybuilding supplements / sleep supplements / etc  
Bodybuilding training regimens  
Hot yoga  
Crossfit

If you are building a personal brand, or theme account \- you need to take audience first vs product first into account. Which we will talk about later. You MAY not want to niche down a crazy amount.

For freelancers and agencies, the more specific the better.

Next post we will talk about researching this market.

Both of these will be necessary to craft an offer/solution FOR that market.

I encourage you to start niching down based on your current experience and interests.

Take the time to research this further if you have to \- that is what will truly help you learn it.

# What You NEED To Understand For Your Social Media Business

I want to get this out of the way real quick and set a foundation for some of the things you will learn here.

If you are on Twitter (which ALL of you are if you joined this group early), you understand the whole ebook dilemma.

Grow an audience with basic tweets and sell an ebook to get rich\!

I'm not one to demonize this, it has its place, but it does create a limit on what you can sell and how much you can sell.

We are here to build something sustainable as a digital product creator, thought leader, consultant, freelancer, solopreneur, etc.

Here is some of what you need to know. This may not make sense to you right now, but trust me, it will.

Offer Creation 

You need to understand that you are not just selling a product or service. 

You are exchanging value (service/productized service) for value (money) 

You need to make your offer SEEM as valuable as possible to your buyer. The value you provide should OUTWEIGH the value they provide. AKA your offer should seem like a worthy investment to them. No matter if it is $300 or $30,000 

You do this by: 

Knowing WHO you are selling to (your customer avatar, must be able to afford what you plan to charge)   
Doing deep research on this avatar to understand their emotional triggers and pain points   
Showing them the PATH, how to get from point A to point B (how are you helping them transform?)   
Being unique through your positioning, unique selling proposition, marketing angle, and path (same as above, your path should be crafted for your avatar)   
Having proper risk reversal (think money back guarantee or "if I don't get X results than I will refund you your money," or "the length of service is 3 months, but I will work with you until we reach X result, if we do not hit it in 3 months")   
Using bonuses and discounts WISELY and to your advantage for negotiation   
Creating tiers of your offer for upsells and downsells (offer stacking)   
Pricing\! Making sure the price reflects the value you provide for the audience you provide to 

Most of you will be selling consulting services based on the contents of your ebook. Expanded, more in-depth, with built-in accountability to actually make it work.

The Basic Social Media Funnel 

Most of your funnels will look like this 

Post lead magnet or ebook to twitter   
Put buyers into a "buyers journey" email sequence (helping them utilize your ebook to the best of their ability)   
\-- If its a lead magnet \- you should put them in a welcome sequence, then sales sequence for your ebook, then buyers \-\> buyers journey \-\> appointment sequence   
Put buyers into an appointment sequence   
\-- Handling objections about your consulting offer, giving out some of your "secrets," using your copywriting knowledge and getting them on a call with you   
Send them to a qualification form to schedule a call   
Getting on a discovery/sales call with qualified buyers   
Sealing the deal

Inbound/Outbound Prospecting 

You should already be making connections on social media and HOPEFULLY you are attracting an audience that fits the bill for your offers (if you want to grow an audience). 

Without going into too much detail for inbound: 

People will DM you for help   
You can write tweets promoting your offer to DM you   
You pre-qualify them via questions regarding where they work/what they do   
You ask what they are struggling with relating to what YOU can help them with   
You offer to give them advice and talk about your offer via a phone call   
Send calendar booking, follow sales process, close 

For OUTBOUND: 

Same DM process to get them on a call   
You start conversations with people that fit the bill of your ideal customer   
You DM people that RT or comment on your posts as they have expressed some form of interest   
You can keep a prospecting list of ideal customers as a twitter "list," start engaging with them so they get familiar with your face. 

All of this sets the stage for what we will be talking about in here.

A lot of this was also covered in the first Solopreneur Foundations training. You HAVE to understand this and keep it in mind at all times so you don't head in the wrong direction.

MOST of your "high ROI" tasks will revolve around these 3 things.

# (For Creatives) Build An Audience & Land Clients At The Same Time

This post will not be for everyone.

It will work best for:

Web designers  
Graphic designers  
Brand designers  
Video editors

And anyone else that has an offer that can be visually displayed on social media.

This can be used by others, but you'll have to get creative with how you go about it.

However, everyone should go through the Advanced Marketing Roadmap and Customer Acquisition Roadmap so your offer is as good as it can get before you do this (and so you can close clients).

The problem with a lot of creative, design, or visual offers:

It is difficult to provide a compelling guarantee, risk reversal, or quantifiable promise unless stacked with another skill.

Like how with web design, you can promise more leads, but that doesn't hold much weight.

And when you study something like funnel creation, you probably won't be offering full websites anymore because you know you can create something better (something that gets direct results).

So, here's what you do.

1\) Pick Someone You Would LOVE To Work With

This is important.

This isn't direct outreach where we can reach out to everyone with little manual work.

You will have limited shots at this, but if you get it right, it will be worth it.

This works best on someone with a lot of followers, but not so much that they don't even log on social media.

Your best bet is to aim for someone with 10K to 200K followers, more or less. Test it out.

2\) Create Something For Them (And Make It HIGH QUALITY)

If you're a web designer, make them a website, landing page, or linktree style page.

If you make clips for TikToks, make it unique. Don't do the same old crappy captions and click bait sounds. Study their brand and make something they can't ignore.

If you are a logo designer, create a logo or illustration for their brand, course, or something else.

Do your best work here.

Even if the person you are making it for doesn't like it – you can use it as a portfolio piece to show people in a similar niche.

3\) Post It To Your Account And Tag Them

Post a screenshot, image, or video of what you made.

Tag the person you made it for in the post.

Something as simple as "Hey @username, I made this for you. Hope you like it." with the image attached.

Be genuine and non-salesy, as that will dictate whether they respond or not. You aren't aiming for the sale here, you are aiming for engagement.

Send them a link to your post in the DMs telling them if they like it, you can send it to them and they can use it for free. This will increase their likeliness of replying, retweeting, or sharing.

Why does this work?

The prospects may look bad if they don't respond to your post (they have public pressure to reply and make their brand look good)  
Their comment, retweet, or share will boost impressions and their audience will see it  
People that see the post will potentially comment and boost impressions further  
People that are interested in your work will reach out and ask for your rates

This way, you get eyes on your content, build authority, potentially make sales, and definitely gain some followers here and there.

# How I Build Out Courses, Guides, Or Lead Magnets

I've had a lot of people ask for a guide on building out a course.

I hesitated writing a guide on it because there are so many different things to take into account:

What are you teaching?  
What format will best deliver that information? (Writing, video, ebook, emails, membership?)  
What are the limitations of the platform you are using to host the files?

At the end of the day, I feel like way too many people overcomplicate this (and for good reason).

You are packaging up knowledge, that you may not have full confidence in, and putting it out into a world of critics and uninformed opinions.

I really believe that is the main problem here.

So here's a brief guide before we dive into the actual guide:

Have an idea for the product  
Build it out however possible  
Launch it and practice dealing with the emotions that come with it

99% of people don't get to step 2 when that's what starts the momentum. It's difficult to stop building once you've started.

Now you have something to improve on. You can always change it. None of this is permanent. Your products evolve as you evolve if you are a personal brand.

If your products don't evolve, I would argue that you are not evolving as a person (and as others evolve, you are willingly staying in a market that is becoming more saturated).

Copying and emulating is the name of the game.

If you stagnate for too long, you will get copied out of business.

Enough of my mini-rant on "just doing it" and "figuring it out."  
Identifying A Personal or Professional Problem

I'm assuming that you already have an idea for a product.

If you don't have an idea, I would assume that you aren't ready to build out a product.

If you need ideas:

What is something that you do on a daily basis that you've improved?  
What problems do you have in your life right now that you can solve?  
How do those things intersect with your expertise or what you talk about on social media?

If your customer avatar is YOU, this becomes much easier. (This is how you earn an income by solving your own problems, Twitter becomes a public journal in a sense).

If your customer avatar is someone else like a business owner, you would be productizing your current service. You can go through everything in the Advanced Marketing Roadmap to nail this down.

With a personal brand, you are continually refining your professional skill set:

Copywriting (getting conversions and engagement)  
Social media growth (sending traffic)  
Email marketing (newsletter or sequences)  
Web design (personal site or blog)  
Graphic design (profile pic and banner)  
Any other professional skill that you talk about or teach on social media

You are also understanding your personal skill set:

Self-improvement  
Mindset and emotional control  
Health and fitness  
Spiritual health  
Communication and social dynamics  
Any other personal skill that you talk about or teach on social media

Throughout your entirety of growing your brand, you will gravitate toward a specific set of skills that you want to become good at.

Some people will spend more time studying and teaching mindset while others will study and teach social media growth.

Having a foot in all of these things gives you SO MUCH leverage that most people don't realize.

These combinations give you a unique of positioning your product down the road.

Now, take some time to brainstorm and braindump journal about problems you've solved for yourself or potential problems you can solve.

Are you a great twitter thread writer? How did you get to that point?

Are you calm and collected all the time? What problem is associated with that and how did you solve it?

Do you suck at writing newsletters? That's a problem. Can you get really good at writing newsletters and document the process?

Take some time to write out the things you are good at, bad at, and the common problems associated with those.  
Testing A System

Systems sell.

The creator economy is actually The Systems Economy.

How can you start testing a system after you've identified a problem?

Notion.

Why Notion? Because it is becoming more and more popular. It is a great way of building out systems for things you do on a daily basis.

It makes it easy to visualize how you solve a specific problem.

(It also acts as an outline for building out a curriculum AND is a cool bonus for your customers).

Based on the problem you identified:

Educate yourself on how to solve it through free online resources, your prior experience, or other courses that can act as inspiration  
Start building out step-by-step processes in Notion that make it easier on you to solve the problem  
Test that process on yourself and refine it as roadblocks come up

Example:

I was never consistent with writing newsletters and always saw them as a daunting task.

From there I could:

Research how to write better long-form content  
Take notes and start practicing  
Create a Notion template that reminds me of the principles and other tips that helped me  
Get results with my newsletter and use that as social proof for the product

I've done this multiple times inside MMHQ.

There are fitness training programs, thread writing guides, and a few other things that are based off of a Notion template.

The curriculum becomes pretty easy to create after that.

What can this Notion system be used for?

An MVP of a SaaS you want to build in the future  
An incentive for testimonials or just to give away to people you are networking with (leading with value)  
What your course curriculum is built off of so they have an actionable way of practicing and implementing what you teach

This is yet another reason why I recommend documenting EVERYTHING in your life. Everything. Put it in Notion.

Your journal, monthly reflections, goals, vision, business SOPs, everything.

All of these can be turned or combined into a product in the future.  
Outlining The Curriculum

Always. Outline. Your. Projects. First.

I don't care if it's a product or just your weekly newsletter.

You are missing out on valuable information if you do not.

Start with a braindump.

Write down everything you would ever want to include in the course or product.

After that, outline course sections, modules, chapters, or whatever it may be.

Let it marinate.

Write down what you are aware of and let your subconscious give you ideas as you go about your week.

As ideas and inspiration come to you, immediately note it down and add it to the outline.

Once the outline feels somewhat complete, start building.  
Building Out The Curriculum

I like to take the "best of both worlds" approach and cover all of my bases.

I write out the entire curriculum, ebook, or guide.

I fill in the blanks, provide real-world examples, and walk people through the Notion systems in a Loom video.

You can create professional PowerPoint-style slides if you'd like (based off of your written curriculum, but Loom just makes it so easy to record your screen and show examples.

Depending on what product hosting platform you are using, you can either write the curriculum in Google Docs (for something like Gumroad) and export each section as a PDF.

Or you can write it all out in a membership dashboard like Kartra or Teachable which makes it easy to separate everything out into modules.

Then, you can download, upload, and/or embed the Loom videos in the respective place inside whatever platform you are using.

It is a tad difficult to go into more specifics than just this (because everyone has different goals and areas of expertise), so I hope that was helpful.

If you have any questions, never hesitate to post them in the business-strategy or writing-and-idea-generation channel\!

If you want 1 on 1 help with all of this, shoot me a DM on Discord to discuss my Digital Consciousness Consulting that I am starting up (it's expensive, but I guarantee brand growth and sales).

Talk soon🤝

# The Purpose Of A Tripwire Offer

A tripwire is a low-cost product that gauges seriousness and interest.

It is a piece of your product offerings that is low commitment and leads into your next product well.

Previously, Websites That Work was a $17 tripwire for my $97 Web Design Wealth (now High Ticket Essentials).

I started out my journey with only WDW, and when I started piecing my email marketing together, I put Websites That Work in a sequence before it. Those that bought WTW were much more likely to buy WDW.  
The Purpose Of A Tripwire

If you have a product or service AND are building an audience — you are guaranteed to have people in your audience that do not want to buy your offer.

So, what can you do? Teach them what is necessary to use your offer. You need to create customers in a sense.

A tripwire:  
Is usually positioned to beginners. Your audience is 95% beginners.  
It is low cost but not free — meaning you have higher quality emails and customers. Buyers are more likely to buy again.  
Raises customer level of awareness surrounding a problem that your main product or service solves.  
Builds trust in you and your future products (so make your tripwire high quality, overdeliver).  
Where Does A Tripwire Go In Your Funnel?

You can sell it directly on the timeline of course, but in your email funnel it goes in between your welcome sequence and main sales sequence.

Ryan Deiss calls this Engagement, but he doesn't limit it to a tripwire. It can be a sequence dedicated to engaging your subscribers.

In this case it can be a free guide related to your product simply to educate them and see if they are interested in that topic (so you know if you should put them in your sales sequence).

I prefer adding a small price tag to guage their seriousness, so it is a tripwire.  
I Recently Created A Tripwire — Here Are The Results

I have been planning on building out a new product (The 2 Hour Creator or something like that).

An idea came to mind to start building out more of the funnel for that product.

A $7 product that would lead both into MMHQ and the new product.

I called it 7 Days To Genius Ideas and positioned it toward beginners.

BOTH those that are already creating content, and those who just want to form a creative habit (so I can show them how simple it is to turn ideas into content).

Do you see how I am raising the awareness levels of my audience?

I am showing them that creating content, a product, or service is as simple as consistently executing on good ideas — so I help them have better ideas that separates them from everyone else.

I launched on a whim the other day — and the results were pretty surprising.

20% of the people that bought the tripwire purchased an MMHQ subscription (if you are reading this — whats up\! I hope you enjoy the transparency I strive for).

And that was only after the first day. I structured it as a challenge. More may join towards the end of that challenge.

Why did they join MMHQ after purchasing the product?  
I gave them a quick win by helping them have a "Genius Idea"  
I told them what they can use that idea for (content, product, or service)  
I positioned MMHQ as a way that helps with that  
Should You Create A Tripwire?

The answer: probably.

Do you have a current product or service that you are selling?  
Have you built out any email sequences yet?  
Does your audience have people that aren't ready for your main product or service yet?  
Can you target those people and educate them enough to be ready for your product or service? (that is, improve them to a point of having better problems that your main offers solve?)  
Would a tripwire fit your offer stack / value ladder to perfection?

As a reminder, here is what a solid value ladder looks like.

Lead magnet that you promote on the timeline to get email subscribers  
(Add the tripwire here if you'd like, it's optional)  
Main product that is a "Do It Yourself" version of your high ticket offer  
High ticket offer that is a Done With You consulting or Done For You freelance offer.  
(You can eventually do super high ticket retreats or seminars if you'd like, again, optional)

Then, once you have all of those fleshed out via the Email Marketing Roadmap, all you have to do is focus on creating content, growing your social media, and plugging your lead magnet.

Then, the other products sell without people knowing it.  
Something new — I just recently got a testimonial software. If you've enjoyed your time here in MMHQ, I'd love to hear about it here.

As always, if you have any questions, leave them in the \#business-strategy channel\!

# The Sales Page Copywriting Framework

I am not a professional copywriter, nor have I done it for freelance work — but I have seen great success with my sales pages.

I have taken copy courses, gotten tips from freelance copywriters, and have tested numerous ways of crafting sales pages. What you will find below is a streamlined way of doing so.

Start to think of your sales page as a way of structuring your marketing strategy. You will be trying to effectively communicated your offer and all of your marketing firepower from the Advanced Marketing Roadmap.

Persuasive Writing Structures

There are 3 writing structures I want you to keep in mind.

AIDA  
Attention, Interest, Desire, Action  
PAS  
Problem, Agitate, Solution  
PASTOR \- read more here  
Problem, Amplify, Story/Solution, Transformation/Testimony, Offer, Response

The common theme with these is using psychological triggers to keep the reader engaged, communicate the value of your offer, and make them convert.

While I do not treat any of these as law, you should keep their general structure in mind.

Is your headline holding attention?   
Are you painting a picture of their big problem(s) relating to your solution?   
Are you agitating / amplifying that problem?   
Do you have a soft story / transformation that relates to their situation?   
Do you introduce your offer / solution in an enticing way?   
Do you have a strong call to action?   
Are you holding the readers attention up until that call to action?

How To Write Your Copy

As with most things, I would highly HIGHLY recommend brain dumping beforehand. Do not try to write the final draft in one go.

Outline, brainstorm, go about your life, let your subconscious work on your copy for you, and take note of things that come to mind as you go about your days.

This is especially true for your headlines, lead, and offer introduction. Write down as many ideas as you can. Force them out of your head. Then come back to them a few days later with more subconscious ammunition.  
The Hero Section (Above The Fold)

There are 4 aspects of a great hero section. For this entire "Hero Section" you will be including as much of your marketing firepower as possible.

A reminder of your marketing firepower:

Your USP  
Your quantifiable end result (or timeframe if you have trouble with QER)  
Your promise / solution  
Your target audience (calling them out catches attention)  
A hint at your unique system/mechanism  
The big problem  
Risk reversal / guarantee

It is up to you to treat these as puzzle pieces, brainstorm, and piece together the perfect hero section using these 4 things:

1\) The Eyebrow (optional)

The eyebrow is the optional text above your headline. Usually small and hardly noticeable. This is where I like to call out my target audience.

2\) The Headline

This is the most important aspect of all of your copy. I typically like to include my promise/solution, aspects of my USP, my QER, and a brief mention of one of their problems.

3\) The Subheadline

I use the subheadline to touch on anything else I missed. Mostly the risk reversal and unique mechanism.

4\) The CTA Button

It only makes sense to have a call to action button in this area. It looks good and gives people the option to buy upfront if they are ready.

Example:

Can you guess how I pieced everything together for the MMHQ copy? Take a second to look at the hero section and see how I pieced things together.

Please keep in mind that MMHQ is a community based around my audience. It has many moving pieces that are a tad difficult to structure in my copy well. If you have a hyper-focused info product, this becomes 10x easier (and you probably shouldn't treat my copy as the greatest way of doing things — compare to a similar product / service as yours).

The Lead

The lead section is where you introduce the problem and agitate it. This can be very simple or complex. Here are 2 things you can include:

1\) Social Proof

I have seen great copywriters recommend including social proof up front. I think it is a smart move IF you have a lot of social proof. It builds trust from the beginning and can be used to handle initial objections.

Include 2-3 strong testimonials.

2\) The Lead

My favorite way of doing this is simple. Bullet points.

When in doubt, bullet points are your best friend. I see it as a way of hitting multiple pain-points and painting a picture of where they are currently at.

It is like a list-style tweet — if people relate with one point, they will like, retweet, and possibly follow (they will keep reading your copy).

The key to these is to get as specific as possible. Dig into your market research from the Advanced Marketing Roadmap. Dig into your past experiences. Brain dump and iterate on what you write down.

Of course, if you need to, have a few sentences before and after the lead to transition nicely from the hero section and into the body.

The Body

The body section is where you include your story, transformation, and solution. This can be in the form of a personal story, a specific client success story, or just a brief explanation of the solution.

I wouldn't overcomplicate this section too much. It does not have to be a certain character or word count.

However, I would try to handle as many objections as possible while telling this story. Refer back to your market research, understand what is going through your customer's mind as they are reading, and handle their objections in your copy.

At the start of this body section you should include a headline. I treat headlines as the big idea behind the entire section. In short, summarize the most compelling points of the body section as the headline.

If your body talks about a client that went from overweight to having a six-pack, your headline could be: How John Lost His Love Handles While Eating Pizza Everday

The Offer Introduction

From what I've heard, your offer introduction should take up no more than 20% of your landing page. (That is, 20% of the \~600 words it will take to get to the end of the main call to action).

As with all major sections in your copy, include a headline at the start. Something as simple as "Introducing \[Product Name\]" works fine.

Keep this brief, use benefits rich language, use bullet points, and use the bullet points in your lead to generate ideas on how to best word these. Your offer introduction should act as a solution to the problems you listed in your lead.

Another thing — you should run through your product / offer outline and write down what the reader actually wants out of each section. Benefits over features.

If you have an ebook and one chapter is on "how to count calories and be in a caloric deficit"

You should write it as: The stupid simple way of guaranteeing weight loss (even if you were to eat a big mac everyday)

You can think of these bullets as mini-headlines. With that, I would study how people write headlines. Watch some YouTube videos and read blog articles on it.

After you introduce different aspects of your offer, you can include another section of bullet points where you introduce the bonuses that come along with it.

Social Proof

Again, have another headline. "Praise From Our 500+ Customers" or something along those lines work.

Then, of course, list off all of the social proof you have. If you don't have any, don't worry — but make it your full time job to get social proof.

Call To Action

The call to action is not as simple as a button. There are multiple things you can include here.

1\) Display Of Value

I like comparing the value of what I am offering to what is currently on the market. Are you giving away information that usually costs more?

Can you break down the what they get relating to the price? (If you are offering a solution to getting a six pack, paint a picture of what that is worth to someone... is a $47 investment worth having your wife look at you with googly eyes?)

Here is an example from the MMHQ landing page:

2\) Giving Them 2 Options

Remind yourself of the main points in your lead (the pain points) and the main points of your offer (the benefits / solution).

Paint a brief picture of where they are now, and give them the option to stay where they are or transform their life.

How you word this is up to you. You don't want to be like, "You can either keep your sh\*tty life or buy my product and change it."

That's just going to lose conversions lol. Have some self-awareness and toy with it a bit.

That's It\! (Kinda)

If you are writing copy for a Gumroad landing page, you can stop here.

Your main call to action should come quick. Display your value with the info above in about 500-700 words and end it there (Gumroad doesn't allow more than one call to action).

If you are creating a page on Carrd, WordPress, or another software that allows you to have CTA buttons anywhere — you can end the copy here or consider it extra.

Now we can dive into the extras that come after the main call to action.

Frequently Asked Questions

Everything that comes after is about objection handling and possibly hitting different marketing angles for those that are unsure about your offer.

FAQ's are pretty straightforward, but the questions should be crafted in a persuasive way.

Bonus Headlines and Sections

You can continue this page for as long as you want with call to action buttons spaced out.

I typically use these to write down more stories, handle objections, target different levels of awareness and include anything that I feel is persuasive.

I can't really teach you how to write these sections. That is completely dependent on your marketing and offer.

If you need inspiration for this or want to see an example, check out the MMHQ landing page (but again, understand that it is a community and I am doing my best to display its value. Your product will most likely be more streamlined with a specific end result.)

# The Greatest Lead Generation & Leverage System

A personal brand is not a "business..." it is a lead generation and leverage system.

The nature of social media relies on individual experiences to grow and gain authority. Per the Social Matrix.

In short, personal branding is a long-term game. Your personal brand is a lead generation mechanism like no other. You are nurturing potential customers long-term (potentially for the rest of your life if you enjoy the work that you don't want to outsource.)

Direct response marketing is a short-term immediate selling game (that gets your loyal fans to make a purchase).

This is very difficult to replicate with cold emails, cold DMs, etc etc. NOBODY CAN REPLICATE YOU.

People do not choose to follow your cold emails or DMs.

Building a personal brand will have people wanting to work with you whether you are good at selling or not. Now imagine when you ARE good at selling. Double whammy.

Bigger Is Better For Brands

There is one common theme for personal brands that nobody seems to take into account.

Everyone is building a BRAND rather than an agency, coaching, or freelancing business.

You don't see any agency accounts on social media trying to land clients. There are some, but who wants to follow a business account that just tries to sell you the whole time?

You see individuals on social media that use their experience to land clients for their agency (or coaching, freelancing, ecom store, or product sales.

Why is bigger better? MORE LEVERAGE & NOT PUTTING YOURSELF IN A BOX.

As Naval said:

"Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media)."

A personal brand can cover many of those bases. Primarily, "people."

That is, building an audience by producing content.

Then, creating digital products or SaaS based around your interests, things you talk about, and problems you solve. (code and media)

As Jack Butcher said:

"Build distribution, then build whatever you want."

The cool thing about this is that your personal brand can pivot and sell anything in the Big 3:

Health  
Wealth  
Relationships  
If you end up hating fitness, sweet \- you can slightly rebrand to something that interests you without destroying your entire business.

If you end up transitioning out of freelancing or client work (like I did) \- you can slightly rebrand as well.

Same goes for everything.

We are building a personal brand for cash flow and fulfilling work, not to sell it like a business. This should give you the opportunity to pursue your interests at any time. Then, if you want to fuel a 'sellable' business down the road with your personal brand's cash flow, easy peasy.

People care about the person behind the ideas, not the ideas.  
Your job is to:

Grow via posting about your experiences in an engageable way   
See: Social Matrix, Master Swipe File, The Legacy Beginner Course, and most of the content in Social Media Strategy  
Get in the habit of bettering yourself and consuming GOOD content   
Set aside time for idea generation (listening to podcasts, reading books, getting content from OUTSIDE of social media so you aren't posting the same things as others)  
Give yourself time.   
Money loves speed, but socials love experience.  
The information, money, trial & error, and life experiences in general compound over time into an incredible personal brand. This may sound silly, but you will only understand this through experience.

Example: I wrote my ebook The Path To Power at the start of my Twitter journey. My new brand Modern Mastery is THE EXACT SAME PHILOSOPHY. I'm just much better at getting my message across now.

"Play iterable games." as Naval said.

Hit publish on the things in life / business that will make you look back 1 year from now and cringe at your work.

You Must Be "Interesting"

Interesting does not mean traveling the world, being surrounded by women, and living in mansions. Sure, this is interesting and does well, but is unrealistic to most.

If you have the time, I would highly recommend studying mimetics \- why humans desire specific things.

In short \- people hop on the bandwagon. If you are enjoying something and sound like you have experience with it, they will want to enjoy it too.

This is why it is important to be confident in what you post \+ have strong convictions. Everyone is second-guessing themselves every second of the day. They will follow your steps if you are confident in your life choices. 

(And this will bring them the most results, even if they fail. At alteast they failed fast in one direction).

The thing with conviction \- what you believe now isn't what you will believe down the road. This is fine. Your content, audience, and self will evolve the longer you are in the game. Personal development \= business development.

How to be "interesting:"

Do things that the masses don't do, this can be as simple as:   
Going to the gym  
Skipping breakfast (haha)  
Drinking a specific kind of water (like San Pellegrino, a meme on Twitter)  
Building a business  
Literally anything that isn't mediocre.

Take note of ALL of the life choices you make and which ones are different than what others do.

I'm serious. What are the weird things that you do?

Do you eat Brazil nuts like Dr. Lagakos? Do you do your own kind of meditation (can you give that kind of meditation a name)? Do you make a smoothie everyday (like my enlightenment elixir)?

Take some time to think about this. This concept started to register with me by studying Matt Ogus' old videos. He used to have his Ogus Cake (an oatmeal cake) and Ogus Salad (a Chipotle bowl thrown on top of a bag of spinach).

The longer you are in the game, the better. You will start making more mental connections. Your quality of life will increase. Your skillset will improve. Online business \= personal development in the creator economy.

Putting Off The Right Energy

This is a weird phenomenon, but people can sense your energy in posts and are attracted to it.

This does not mean you have to be extremely energetic and hyped up all the time \- you simply have to be consistent with how you speak.

For myself, I aim for calm and insightful \- kind of like a philosopher \- because one of my goals in life is to be able to articulate my points like a philosopher. I want to achieve depth and impact.

This is incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to teach.

Study how accounts speak on all social platforms. The accounts that YOU vibe with the most. These will not be the same accounts other's like.

Doing this will turn you into an amalgamation of the top players in their space.

Creating a mood board for your brand has proven helpful in doing this well:

Find 1-2 scenic images on Google, Unsplash, or Pexels that represents your "vibe." (Think of your end goal \- what environment do you want to live in? What environment does your audience want to live in when imagining their future?)   
Examples:  
A cabin in a forest with dark tones (lumberjack vibe)  
A beach with palm trees (adventurous and serene vibes)  
Skyscrapers and cities (I use this \- because it represents structure and "big city living")  
Find 1-2 images of a human that shows your "vibe" \- like a customer avatar for yourself. If you want to choose an image from the accounts you want to emulate, that makes it easier. Be sure it matches the vibe you put off in real life.   
Examples:  
A stoic philosopher for deep thoughts and insights  
A bronze age bodybuilder for "the good life"  
A businessman in a suit near a rooftop pool  
Start thinking about what imagery attracts YOUR attention.  
Who do you follow on social media?  
What kind of lifestyle do they promote and what does it look like?

In essence, you are painting a picture of the lifestyle that YOU and your audience want to achieve. YOUR VISION.

Broad Catch, Specific Sale

With a personal brand, you are defining the vision, "why," and mission of the company.

In this case, YOU are the company. YOU are the niche.

You need to understand yourself to be able to effectively communicate your vision for others.

Your brand is what pulls in loyal followers that join in and spread your message.

When it comes to sales, direct response marketing is king. We have an entire roadmap on this (advanced marketing and offer creation), but for now understand that the two are different.

Direct response marketing is targeting one specific persona with one specific offer that solves one of their burning problems via emotional leverage.

Direct response is best used:  
In paid advertising  
In promotional tweets/content  
On your landing page  
In your sales emails  
Offer creation  
Cold outreach  
Direct response \= sales. You are trying to get an immediate action/conversion out of someone.

General marketing / Branding is what a wide range of people are attracted to. This is best used to gain loyal and fanatic followers (refer back to the Social Matrix to understand this deeper.

Think of it like this \- your brand is for showing them the lifestyle you are helping them work towards \- your sales are for giving them the tools to do that.

This is also an introduction to marketing angles and positioning.

I.E. If your brand promotes financial freedom \- you can sell a product/service on web design, philosophy, marketing, writing, or anything else that can be tied to financial freedom.

What you help them accomplish \+ what you've done and can teach that will help them get there (even if it's only a small step towards their desired end goal).

If you enjoyed this post \- consider giving MMHQ a shoutout on Twitter and tagging me in it. This helps a lot in terms of word-of-mouth marketing IF you truly enjoy it here.

# How To Write An Appointment Sequence

The final piece of the email marketing puzzle for a bit\! We could still talk about segmentation and affiliate sequences, but for now \- a great general structure for creators, coaches, and freelancers is to:

Have a lead magnet  
Put downloaders into an indoctrination sequence  
Then put them into a sales sequence for your tripwire or low ticket product  
Put them into an appointment sequence for your high ticket offer (this article)  
Tag subscribers that finish the sequences to send some form of consistent newsletter.

If you are unsure how to create these sequences, you can use ConvertKit (here is an article of how to set things up), or Kartra if you want an all in one platform.

Now, this will be my strategy that has worked for me in getting leads per my sales process. You should have your offer worked out, some form of lead generation and qualification process, and be ready to take on clients.

This appointment sequences make it easier to automate the lead generation process and work leads up the customer levels of awareness. This makes it easy to plug your lead magnet only and land clients. Once you have a large enough audience you can start to transition from DM outreach to this.

The Value Emails

This has a similar structure as a sales sequence. You don't want to ONLY be sending promotional emails or else people will get annoyed.

You need to have 3-4 value emails that discuss more advanced topics. Make people more and more aware of the BIGGER problem that your high ticket offer solves.

You should have this part on lock per the last articles on indoctrination and sales sequences.

The Offer Introduction Emails

For 1-2 emails, you will give people a complete rundown of your offer. Who it's for, what problem it solves, your STRONG risk reversal, a lot of social proof, and a strong call to action.

You want to reduce as much friction as possible with them clicking the link and expressing interest. I would recommend having an intake form without a link to schedule a call. Calls imply pressure and time. Read through this article to set up your qualification process.

With these 1-2 emails, you have to make sure they understand every aspect of your offer. Follow the Godfather Offer template and write it out compellingly using the PASTOR sales copy framework.

The Follow Up Emails

This is where the appointment sequence is different. THE MONEY IS MADE IN THE FOLLOW-UPS.

If you have sent cold outreach messages, you know this is the case. Email marketing is our way of automating this.

You will be sending quite a few follow-ups.

Start at 1 follow-up every 3 days for a week or two.

Then go up to 1 follow-up every week for 2-3 weeks.

Then 1 follow-up every 2 weeks for 2-3 weeks.

(After these follow-ups, I like to copy and paste my offer introduction email and remind them of everything that the offer consists of.)

Then 1 follow-up every month for 1-2 months.

People get busy. They need to be reminded of your offer and that it is a fit for them.

You can talk about different parts of your offer in these follow-up emails, or just ask if they are free for a call. You can test different angles as well.

That's it.

As a beginner, I wouldn't overcomplicate this. Get the emails written to the best of your ability. You can always go back and change them. That's the beauty of this... the "build once, sell twice" philosophy of Jack Butcher. You are building something that you can constantly iterate on.

# How To Write A Sales Sequence

This article is for those that have a lead magnet and some form of product to sell. If you have a service, this will work \- but I will be writing an article specifically for high ticket service sequences (since the sales process is different).

Your lead magnet should be putting people into an indoctrination sequence. Here is an article on how to write your indoctrination sequence \- and another article for how to set up your sequences in ConvertKit.

Once you have all of those, let's dive in:

The Problem Emails

As with everything in marketing, much of your content is based on raising people up the customer levels of awareness. Making them hyper-aware of their problems, proposing the benefits to solving them, and giving them the system for self-transformation.

If you have a product, you should have some idea of what problems you target audience is experiencing. If you haven't, you need to conduct market research. You can probably start to see why having a solid marketing strategy is absolutely necessary. It bleeds into all of your content, branding, promotions, and more.

The first 3-5 emails of your sequence are going to:  
Present valuable topics related to what you are selling  
Introducing the BIG problem that they are facing  
Making them understand how it's impacting their life (painting a picture of the worst-case scenario, negative visualization)  
Explaining a transformation they can undergo. Using your own or a previous customers' as an example.  
Doing this in the form of valuable emails that explain but don't show how. You can make people aware without explaining every little detail. (A good example of this is my previous email on the one-man business model. It is not a sales email, but is a good example of explaining and not showing.)  
You can think of these as blog posts, but they display your expertise related to your product. You are making them understand why they should do the same thing as you.

In the last 1-2 emails, you can leave a soft-sell at the end in the form of a P.S.

"If you are interested in \[ABC benefits or solving XYZ problems\] the check out \[name of course\] here."

This is kind of like a drawn-out and sales call. You are just automating it with email. Same things go for DMs. They are all sales. Sales sales sales.

These will also be used and condensed when it's time to sell.

By the time they hit your sales emails, they should be at level 4-5 of the customer awareness levels.

The Sales Emails

Now that they are aware of the problem they need to be solved, it's time to provide the solution for it.

The next 2-3 emails of the sales sequence:  
For a sales email, you should follow the general problem \> story \> offer introduction \> call to action while letting lose all of your marketing firepower.  
You can also follow the PASTOR framework for writing the email.  
Provide as much social proof as you can (one of these emails can even be "X got Y results" as the subject line. Then diving into the problem, explaining their transformation, and so on.  
By this point many of your subscribers will be at level 5 on the awareness level. They need some form of scarcity and urgency to buy.

Here's what you can do for scarcity:  
Have a discount for a limited time. Since this is an automated sequence, you will have to use something like Kartra which has countdown timers, or create a custom landing page with Carrd for your Gumroad product and use Deadline Funnel for evergreen countdowns.  
You will run this sale for 1-2 days and send reminder emails until it ends.  
If you are unable to do an automated countdown, you can add on a bonus or just have a discount without a timer.

Once you have your sales sequence in place, all you have to do is promote your newsletter or lead magnet on the timeline consistently and let people run through your sequences.

If you have any questions about this, drop a question in the \#business-strategy channel\!

# How To Write An Indoctrination Sequence

If you are considering writing an indoctrination sequence, you should have 1 of 2 things:

A lead magnet relevant to your product or what you talk about  
A simple email opt in page

Once you have these, you can use your email marketing software of choice (ConvertKit is good, I am using Kartra for everything). You can also use Gumroad Workflows, I made a tutorial on it here.

You will be putting the people that opt-in into this sequence.

Tangent: Start thinking of any digital product, free or paid, as an offer. Run them through this framework so you can get maximum signups and write better, more compelling copy.

The Welcome Email

In your welcome email, you should:  
Thank them for downloading your product or opting-in  
Tell them your brand's mission, the reasons you do what you do  
Tell them what they can expect in the next emails  
Ask them to reply telling you they got the email or downloaded the product (this helps with your email sender score)

The Story Emails

Your story emails are 1-2 emails that describe your transformation or a client's (or both). These help build authority and authenticity with your subscribers.

Your story emails should include:  
Where you started out. A position they can relate to. This builds trust (you can begin to introduce the problems(s) that your products/services solve per the customer levels of awareness)  
What sparked the change, the mentors you had, what you decided to dedicate yourself to, and why  
The resolution. How you fixed the problem and dug yourself out of the whole. Why it set you on the path you are on now

I personally split mine up into two emails. I introduced the low point of my life in the first, then a few more failures and resolution in the second.

You CAN end your indoctrination sequence here. Especially if they signed up for a newsletter only (so they don't get spammed with emails).

If you want to add more emails, here we go.

The Introductory Emails

I like to think of introductory emails as broad explanations of the topics you talk about. You can have 2-3 of these in your sequence.

Talk about the importance of the things you've learned along your journey and aided in your transformation. An introduction to your expertise and the things you teach.

If you are a web designer, introduce how web design can impact somebody's business.

If you are a fitness coach, introduce the importance of fitness in all aspects of life.

Etc.

Treat these as a blog post of sorts \- or any other structured long form content.

In copy: the lead (problem), the body (transformation, steps they can take), solution (the benefits it will have on their life.

The Golden Framework: what (setting the scene), how (steps to desired result), why (the emotion behind it).

This sets the stage for hitting hard on specific problems in their lives related to those topics when its time to have a sales sequence for your product / service.

Other Info

You can space these emails out as much as you'd like. I've normally spread them apart to go out every 2-3 days.

Most other things should not be overthought. You can test and iterate for your lifetime of entrepreneurship. Just get the sequence up and running so you can start promoting your opt in page\!

As always, if you have any questions, pop them in the \#business-strategy channel.

# Qualifying Prospects So You Don't Waste Time On Calls

I've had a few members ask about qualification, here is exactly how I do it.

This is for those that have a high ticket offer \- freelancing, coaching, consulting, or a high ticket course.

You should understand where this comes in the sales process.

First, you create your offer and run it through some of the marketing articles.

Then when it comes time to reach out to potential clients and get them on a call \- you will need to qualify them. Too many people get on calls with anyone and everyone just to find out that they genuinely can't afford their service. This wastes time. Wasted time \= wasted money.

Before you dive into this \- you should have something to sell, understand how to DM your target audience, qualify them (this post), then get on a sales call with them.

For a deeper explanation of all of the above \- check out the Sales Mastery Training with Andy Strohm.

Here is how you qualify your prospects.

The Traditional Method: Calendar link with qualifying questions

Downside \- you don't have much control over who schedules a call (you don't know if they can afford your services BEFORE the call is scheduled).  
Upside \- good for those that are under $10K per month and are going for sheer volume of calls from inbound/outbound DMs (don't have a built out funnel with consistent leads)

The Gym Salesman Method: Intake form (questionnaire) \> call the prospect \> close them or schedule another call

Downside \- the prospect may not answer the phone and you will have to follow up to schedule a call. You have to CALL while the lead is hot \- within 15-30 minutes after they fill out the form. Some people don't have that flexibility.  
Upside \- you can close the deals quick.

The Automated Method: Intake form \> information gets put into a Google sheet \> you or a commission-based closer can call them or DM them.

Downside \- you will need a consistent flow of leads from your social media audience / other promotional channels.  
Upside \- If you have a closer, it is hands off. You can also DM them with more qualifying questions or send them your calendar to schedule a call. (Sometimes you can just close them in the DMs.)

Your Sales Funnel

Let's keep this brief.

If you are DMing people and walking them through the DM script \- then you don't necessarily need a landing page describing your offer or running through the copywriting framework.

The main time you will need a landing page is for traffic that doesn't go through the DMs (your bio link, emails, or promotions on the timeline).

If you are DMing them \- send them straight to the intake form. If you aren't \- send them to your landing page that links to the intake form.

Your Intake Form

An "intake form" is just a fancy way of saying questionnaire. It will have qualifying questions and everything you need to take control of the sales call.

You will need 2 things \- a calendar (with form functionality) and a form software.

Calendly (free \+ paid) \- You will absolutely need a Calendly account. You will have to upgrade to add more questions and have more flexibility. You will need this whether you have a separate intake form or not.  
JotForm (free) \- You can create your intake form here for free and get email notifications for new leads. (Downside: I don't like the design of the forms).  
TypeForm (free \+ paid) \- A great-looking form with a lot of customizability and automation features.  
Google Forms (free) \- A classic solution that can pair with Google Sheets to capture your leads information.

Questions For Your Intake Form

I've told you time and time again to emulate what others in your niche are doing, this time is no different.

Find somebody who has a similar offer to you and swipe the questions they have on their intake form.

Here are some tried and true options:

First name, email, phone number, and social media handle  
What do you do for work? (soft qualification, you can judge their income)  
What is your motivation behind wanting X? (X \= the result / service you offer them)  
What is your current \[state\]? (where they are now in relation to your service)   
For marketing services \- \[state\] \= current monthly revenue  
For fitness coaching \- \[state\] \= fitness starting point  
For performance coaching \- \[state\] \= revenue or mental state  
What is your target \[state\]? (where they want to be through your service)  
Where would you like to see exponential improvement? (multiple choice with different aspects of what you offer)  
What are you struggling the most with in that area? (relating to the question above)  
How long have you been trying to get X results?  
On a scale of 1-10 how serious are you about getting X results?  
If we decide you are a fit \- will you be ready to move forward on the call? Or do you need someone else's approval?   
Bonus if you are getting qualified leads consistently \- enter the price range of your services.  
"Our services range from $1000-$5000. If we decide you are a fit for one of our packages \- will you be ready to move forward on the call? ..."

This is a very minimal landing page \- as discussed above \- you don't NEED one. But something barebones like this with some qualifying questions and social proof does well.

If you remember the DM script \- we are literally asking the same questions. We are helping them dive deeper into what they want and understanding that they need something to help them get there. It is OK to repeat these questions \- if not necessary.

Personally Reach Out

Once they have filled out your intake form \- email, call, or DM them.  
Ask them:

"Yo my friend\! I got your application for X. One more question for you \- what made you fill out the application? Where do you want to take this project?"

You can go on to ask more qualifying questions if you are iffy about them, but if you are just starting out \- get on calls and offer value to everyone.

When they respond, acknowledge their response and compliment them on wanting to change \- then tell them to schedule a call and drop your Calendly link.

Calendar With Additional Qualification

By now you should have your Calendly account setup. Create a specific "event" for your calls and title it "Strategy Call" (or discovery / clarity call... doesn't really matter what \- just don't call it a sales call.)

Questions For Your Calendar

Some of these may be repeat questions (which is important) but we want to dive deeper and see if they are actually a fit (financially and mentally).

In 90 days from now what results would you like to see in your \[fitness, business, relationships\]?  
Be honest... what is holding you back from getting there?  
If I can help you get X result, what would you want your \[fitness, business, relationship\] to look like after working with me? Paint me a picture.  
(Optional) The tiers of this \[service\] start at $X. Are you in the financial position to invest that into solving X problem right now?

These will give you a good idea if you need to reach out and just pitch from the DMs or accept the call.

If you have any questions related to this post \- drop them in the \#business-strategy channel\!

Enjoy the rest of your Tuesday my friends.

# The Outreach Formula For Consistently Landing Clients

We've talked about the longer / more time consuming method of outreach in the article How To Land $1k-$10k Clients In The DMs Without A Lot of Followers, but there comes a time when you can be more strategic (and less time consuming).

Here is how you craft the perfect outreach message. Whether it's DMs, cold email, or any other medium.

How To Structure An Outreach Message

Here is an example of what we want to accomplish. This isn't the BEST \- I think the first line could be a bit more personal and dive into my other content \- but this message got me on a call with her and I paid for her services ($3000/mo).

The Hook  
Dive into your prospect's content and find something that they would be proud of.

A deep tweet that didn't get much engagement  
An insight from a podcast episode  
A specific part of a blog post  
Any other post on social media that breaks their current content strategy (they may be testing something new and could use a compliment)

Then, let them know what you enjoyed about it or how it resonated with you.

Take a look at the first line from the screenshot above and make it better through deeper research.

Example: I wrote a blog post about focus a few months back. You could read that article and comment on one of the most complex parts and why you liked it (because I like to feel smart, and not many people saw it).  
3 Different Options For Authority

Social Proof And Name Dropping

EXACTLY how Shreya did in the screenshot above. Mention someone you have worked with (that the other prospect may know) and tell them the results you got them.

These results will make the other prospect want the same results.

Actionable Tips

Simple, give 2-3 ACTIONABLE tips that can help them immediately.  
This mainly works for freelancing services because you can SEE what they are currently doing. You can look through their landing page, copy, emails, or whatever else you specialize in.

This shouldn't be used for coaching offers UNTIL you know what they are struggling with.

Free Work

There are two ways to send free "work."

Offering to audit their current state  
Offering to send a "sample" of your work that they can use

For the audit: you are offering to give them 2-3 actionable tips on something that they've already done in video form. You can use Loom to record your screen and voice while doing this.

For the sample: Do what you are best at and send it to them for free (i.e. tweets, landing page, social posts, emails, copy, etc.)

THE KEY WITH THIS: only offer to send the free work. Don't send it at first. Simply ask, "Can I send you an audit/work I made for you? You can use it or trash it." Once they say "yes," THEN do the work and send them a link.

The Call To Action

The call to action needs to be plain and simple.

"Do you have time for a call this week to see if we can get you the same results?"

Or, "Do you have time for a call this week?"

Or however fits your natural voice.  
The Vessel

There are 3 ways to send these messages. I encourage you to try them all.  
If they don't respond via one channel, try another. Email them or DM them on Instagram/LinkedIn if they don't respond on Twitter.

The 3 Vessels:

Video DM \- write out your outreach message from above and record a video of yourself to send to them.  
Regular DM \- just send the DM and try different platforms.  
Cold email \- send your outreach message in the form of an email.

P.S. You can still follow the script in How To Land $1k-$10k Clients In The DMs Without A Lot of Followers \- and I encourage AT LEAST prequalifying a bit and having them tell you where they want to take their project (in terms of money and lifestyle).

I hope you enjoyed this article my friends \- please put this into practice and have a great Tuesday.

# Conversational Sales Script To Close $5k-$10k Deals

If you haven't already looked over the DM script for getting people on a call, check it out here.

I would also highly recommend using this script in conjunction with the Sales Training with Andy Strohm.

You’ve got your call scheduled, now it’s the time to seal the deal.

Your mindset going into this call should be focused on having a conversation with your potential client.

Putting yourself in a position of wanting to HELP them rather than sell them.

Trust me when I say this makes it much easier to bring the energy and flow through the call.

You can approach this call in one of two ways (I would try both and see which gives better results \+ is more enjoyable for you to do.)

1\. Offer free advice \- give them at least 3 URGENT and actionable steps they can take right now. At the end of giving advice, ask if they are confident in doing this by themselves. If they aren't, pitch your service. (This works well as a beginner to practice sales and get some easy consulting under their belt).

2\. Position your offer as help \- at the end, go straight into talking about your offer

Before we dive in… remember that this is a conversation. A hard-set script does not offer any flexibility.

Think of this as a framework rather than a script.

After EVERY question, acknowledge their answer and continue moving through the script.

1\. Say Hello

Say hello, talk about something like the difference in weather in the places you both live (or use another conversation starter). Simply have something that will start the call on a non-awkward note.

2\. Framing

You want to guide the conversation and remain in charge, setting expectations and telling them what will happen will keep you in charge.

You: “Okay so on this call I’ll begin by asking you some questions to gain a better understanding of your business and goals. Then, if it sounds like we would be a good fit, I’ll tell you a bit about myself and what I do. Then at the end, you can make a decision if you want to be a part of it. Sound fair?”  
They will say yes.

3\. Motivations

They hopped on the call with you for a reason. They are more than likely interested in your service, make them understand their interest more.

You: “So I always begin by figuring out people’s motivations. I talk to quite a few people and everybody has different reasons for talking with me. So.. why did you decide to take time out of your schedule to hop on this call with me today?”

4\. Understand Where They Are

Understanding where they are in terms of their goal will allow you to put yourself in the middle and help them reach their goal (while building trust). 

Having the prospect talk about it will make them realize that they may really need some outside help.

You: “So listen (CLIENT NAME) I know we don’t know each other very well just yet. I just want you to be honest about what you’re really struggling with right now. Like what’s the biggest problem that you’re facing right now in regards to (WHAT YOU HELP PEOPLE WITH)?”

This is where you want to dig DEEP. Here are some guiding questions to help them realize their deeeep pain.

These are just sample questions, you will get better at diving deep into their pain points with your own questions.

Can you tell me what you mean by that exactly? How else is that showing up for you?  
What has this cost you specifically? (time, energy, attention, money, peace of mind)  
What do you think is causing this to happen right now?  
How long have you been trying to solve this?  
Are other people affected by this? If so, who?

Here we are making them realize that their problem is not surface level.  
They are literally voicing their deep (and possibly biological) problem. This will help quite a bit.

P.S. DO NOT SKIP PAST THE EXTRA QUESTIONS. DO NOT JUST MOVE FORWARD AFTER ASKING WHAT THEY ARE STRUGGLING WITH.

You will get better at this over time.

5\. Where They Want To Be

Now that you have listened and understood their pain \- it is time to let THEM paint a picture of their own future for you.

This is where you can come in and become their savior.

You: "So tell me (NAME), where do you want to be in a year from now? Paint me a picture of your life. From your daily life to your business, what are you most looking forward to?

Let them talk without interruption. If they get stuck, give them suggestions... "Do you want to travel? How much do you want to make per month? How much time do you want to spend working? (Use questions related to your offer and what you can help them improve at.)

Now is the time to position yourself as the beacon of hope.

6\. The Beacon of Hope

When you are explaining your offer \- keep each part/section to a sentence or two and focus on the benefits (how it will help them reach their goal).

At the end of the day, all they care about is their own transformation and results.

Follow this structure:

"Based on what you shared today, It sounds like you are struggling with (insert problem) And you want to (insert goal/desire) but the thing that has been holding you back is (insert what is holding them back). Does that sound right?"

"Good news is, I can help you get there (without inconvenience). Are you confident in handling this on your own? Or would you like to hear a bit about what I do?"

"I have a 60-day program that would help you (insert outcome/goal they want)."

"Here is what you get \- (list the main parts of your offer along with the benefits, relate these benefits to the goals they gave you.)"

"This program was built specifically to help you solve (inset BIG problem) so that you can (insert BIG promise)."

"That way, you can have (insert big emotional benefits like more time with your wife, more energy, more money, etc.) and I will be walking you through it step by step. How does that sound?"

6\. Seal The Deal

At this time, they SHOULD ask what the price is. If they don’t, go ahead and tell them.

Give them a contrasting price & and price anchor if they pay ON THE CALL.

Contrasting price:

$5000 is nothing compared to the amount of time they’ve already wasted and will continue wasting trying to solve their problem.

You: “The investment today is $5000, which, would go towards solving \[X problem\] for life.”

“BUT, you seem like someone who would put this information into effect and get great results, those are the type of people I love working with. For that reason, I can knock off $1000 if you decide to move forward today, making the investment $4000.”

(This is optional, you will see why at the end.)

Now…. STAY QUIET

Do not start justifying your price if they take a bit to answer. The ball is in their field. Silence works.

If they say YES \- (prepare an invoice before the call) send the invoice and walk them through paying it. This is not as awkward as it seems.  
Once they pay, ask them when they would like to start and tell them what next steps are (normally this is onboarding.)

If they object \- most objections now will be about the price. Here are some ways to get around it.

The most common objection: "I will have to think about it"  
In this case, you either didn't qualify the prospect enough or they still have questions.

You: "If you don't mind me asking, why the hesitation? Is it related to the program? Or does it have to do with price?"

After they tell you, you can proceed accordingly with more info about the offer or proceed to downsell.

Some will try to negotiate and ask for more of a discount.

Have bonuses ready \- depending on your offer, instead of decreasing the price you can add on to the offer.

If it is 8 weeks of coaching, you can add on another 2 weeks of support or give them free access to some of your premium content.

If they do not accept this \- sell them on something else or take away parts of your offer.

(THIS is the importance of offer stacks / upsells and downsells)

If you are offering a landing page, email sequences, and Facebook ads for lead generation. You can take away the monthly retainer Facebook ads and upsell them after you deliver on the first offer.

If you are offering coaching \- you can create an "accelerated" version for half the price and a "micro" coaching offer to downsell further.

A lot of the time they won't want parts of it being taken away, they will accept the main price.

If they don’t budge, accept it and move on. There is nothing you can do about it and the client relationship would not work.

If you enjoyed this post, let me know by tagging me on Twitter and mentioning MMHQ with what you enjoyed about it and I'll retweet you.

# $5K Fast Track \- Stop Spinning Your Wheels & Focus On What Makes Money

Who is this post for?

Those that have a skill, information, or expertise that they want to sell via a digital product or freelance/coaching service.

Alright, the last thing I want is for people to be spinning their wheels and overthinking what they need to do to make money.

Refining your offer, marketing, and promotional tactics are great \- but if they take your focus away from lever-moving tasks, you won't get anywhere.

Your marketing can be the best in the business but if it isn't in front of people's faces then it is all in vain.

Where Do I Start?

For all of the beginners out there \- if absolutely nothing comes to mind when I ask you, "What do you want to sell?" Here's what you need to do:

1\) Learn SOMETHING, anything... even the information inside this community.

Interested in web design? Learn it.

Interested in mental performance? Learn it.

Interested in becoming a marketing consultant? Start studying what I'm teaching here and reach out to help people.

Email marketing? Learn.

Habits? Learn.

Twitter ghostwriting? Learn.

You cannot skip this phase.

Watch YouTube videos, buy courses, read blog articles, and do everything you can to become very well-read in that area.

2\) Learn by doing/teaching

You can only learn so much from YouTube and free information.

You need to build real-world projects (with skills) and get real-world results/experience (with interests/intangibles like habits)

THEN start reaching out to potential clients or create your first MVP (minimum viable product)

Some will say you aren't ready to do this yet, I think that's bullshit gatekeeping due to a large ego.

It is a necessary step to get SOMETHING out there so you can get direct feedback and make it better.

All of this should happen in a timeframe of 2-4 months.

If you fall into this category, pay close attention to the "personal development" side of things in this community and ask questions along the way.

Creating A Solid Offer The First Time Around

There is somebody out there that is making millions of dollars selling what you want to sell.

There's a dude making millions from teaching people how to take pictures of birds. BIRDS.

The point of this is, there is somebody that is already successful selling what you want to sell. You can research them, learn all about their offer, buy the product, and study their entire funnel.

Pay close attention to WHY it is a good offer.

What is the price? Why does that matter?  
What bonuses do they offer?  
How do they deliver the contents of the offer?  
What are the most compelling aspects of their copywriting?  
What is their guarantee?  
What pain points are they targeting? (Usually found at the start of their landing page)  
What is their quantifiable end result? (What specific solution are they solving?)  
WHO is their target audience? Why does that specific group of people need their offer?

How do you find these offers to study and emulate? From the people you learned from.

Or, just spend a day typing questions related to the offer in Google or find people that are selling similar in Facebook groups, on Twitter, or LinkedIn

This is only one aspect of market research (which you will continue to iterate on).

A few things to pay attention to here:

How do they position their offer in a way that makes people more money?  
How do they position their offer in a way that saves people more time?  
How do they position their offer in a way that solves a huge problem within the health / wealth / or relationships vertical?  
Do they offer one skill? Or a stack of skills to get results?

The thing that most people get stumped on is solving a problem BIG enough that makes the right person hand over their money without even reading into it.

Find the people that have already discovered that big problem, swipe it.

It's truly incredible how far ahead of the competition you can get just by doing this for a few days. (Yes, a few days if not weeks, spend time on this and write down everything you find.)

Okay... You Have An Offer. What Next?

A few things.

Testimonials  
SALES  
Traffic source

THESE are what you should be focusing on.

If you aren't at $5k/month then you should not be focusing on anything else but these.

Once you have a solid offer with solid testimonials that are pulling in money for you \- you can start to optimize, refine your marketing, build a more complex funnel, and pump money into growing your audience (so you can promote to more people).

Before we dive into those 3 things, let's talk about high ticket and low ticket offers.

If you want to sell a low ticket offer right out of the gate (digital product, physical product), that's cool. But understand that it will take some time to build a large enough audience to sell to if you don't have money to spend/test/and iterate with paid ads.

High ticket is the move, even if it's just one-off consulting calls to display your expertise, validate your offer, and pull in some early testimonials.

1\) Getting Testimonials and Getting Your Name Out There

For the time being, stop thinking about if you will get paid for your work or not. Lead with value, offer to help for free or at a discount, and ask for a testimonial in return.

How do you do this?

Take your offer, keep an eye out for your ideal customer on whatever platform you are on, and run through this DM script.

(P.S. In the next article, I'll talk about the best niches, angles, and positioning for Twitter)

DM them, offer them free help on a call (or in the DMs), write their name down in a word document, and set reminders to follow up with them for more help and a testimonial.

DMs are a lever-moving task.

Think of it as planting seeds. Every person you DM with the intention of helping, you gain experience, expertise, and possibly a loyal follower / fan for life.

Imagine if you sent 3 DMs a day for 2 months. If you didn't make $5k I would be baffled.

Go into this with the mindset of helping whoever you can.

2\) Sales Sales Sales

Now that you've started helping others, not only will you:

Feel more confident in your offer  
Validate your offer and refine it as necessary  
Possibly get offered money for your help

You will also:

Create the habit of DMing people (necessary)  
Understand that DMing random people is actually fun and rewarding  
Get used to putting yourself outside of your comfort zone

The MAIN thing that matters when you are starting out is sales.  
No fancy funnel or website.

All you need is either a gumroad page (for digital products) or a calendly with qualifying questions (to book sales calls from the DMs (post on this coming later))

If you do creative work, have a portfolio of course.

If you don't have a portfolio, create one by creating projects for people you would LOVE to work with. DM them and offer it to them for free. Do the BEST WORK POSSIBLE and even if they don't use it... you have a portfolio piece and possibly a testimonial.

Once you've help 3-4 people and have some form of testimonials, start reaching out for paid work.

Start off at $500-$1000 (for most marketing/creative skills).

If you offer something like graphic design, can you create a package that you can sell for this much rather than a one-off design?

I.E. a landing page, thumbnail, ebook cover, and ebook design for people that sell ebooks. Get creative with this.

Get better testimonials than before.

Increase to $1500-$2500.

Get better testimonials than before and focus on getting results.

Too many people try to do the bare minimum with this stuff.

Now, in terms of sales, there is a training dropping in a few days \- you'll be able to find it in the online business trainings. It's from Andy Strohm responsible for $70 million in sales.

He will walk you through the entire process and how to avoid common pitfalls when you are pitching your service.

A simple yet good metric: You have consistent calls with people.  
If you DM 3-5 people a day to start, get 1-4 on a call per week, and close 1 per week, that's a good amount of money.

Organic Traffic

We've touched a good amount on Twitter growth here.

If you sell high ticket (coaching/freelancing/consulting) then you don't need to build an audience... but it's fun and gives you perceived authority.

Plus if you ever want to switch down the road you can sell anything related to your interests along with your high ticket offer.

If you sell a low-ticket product, building an audience is almost implied or necessary. If you have money to spend, I would highly recommend investing in paid growth (retweets) and plugging your product under each one.

We can talk more about organic in another post, but understand that building an audience is extremely powerful and more than doable on Twitter.

Next Important Thing To Mention

Follow up, follow up, and follow up again.

Anyone that has done cold email knows this is where the real money is made.

If somebody doesn't respond after a day or two, send them a message like

"Hey, I know your DMs get busy and wanted to bump this up."

Follow up until you get a hard "no."  
Whew.. this was a long post and I hope I didn't miss anything.

If you have any questions, toss them in \#business-strategy.

If you enjoyed this post, leave a comment in \#General Chat.

If you really want to help out, tell me what you thought about it on Twitter and tag me in your post.

Have a great week everyone.

# The DM Seduction Method \- How To Land $1k-$10k Clients In The DMs Without A Lot of Followers

If you have ANY form of an audience (from 500-500,000) followers, you can make a boatload of cash. 

Before you do this \- your profile and content should reflect what you are offering.

Here is what you need:

1\. Somebody to DM

These are people that fit within your customer avatar. Considering many of you are doing this on Twitter \- make sure you are keeping an eye out for people that fit the bill.

In terms of inbound and outbound DMs \- you should be attracting the right people with The Twitter Matrix for content.

When you post social proof or authority tweets, you may receive a few inbound DMs (this is unlikely if you have a very small audience.

What you can do instead is DM 1-5 people every day that engage with your authority posts.

The best people to DM are the ones that retweet or reply, likes work as well but that would take a LOT of DMs.

2\. A high ticket offer (or any offer)

Coaching  
Freelancing  
Consulting  
Course

If you do not have an offer and are just starting out \- that's fine, you should be using these tactics as a way to give out free advice and validate your potential offer and get testimonials.

3\. An extremely simple funnel

Landing page (optional) \- To have social proof and other information before sending them to the questionnaire.  
Qualifying questionnaire \- to filter out qualified from unqualified before you spend time on a call with them.  
You can use your website software, Jotform, or Google forms for this  
Scheduling software (I.E. Calendly) \- to reach out to them after the questionnaire to get them on a call with you (an upcoming sales training with sales coach Andy Strohm will help you with the call).

THAT’S IT.

No crazy webinar funnels, no ads.

Your entire purpose with DM seduction is to hit some pain points, offer help, and have them schedule a strategy call with you.

It really is that simple.

Don’t think so? Read this:

My buddy Devin McDermott followed this system \- talked to someone with a porn addiction (most people) \- got him on a call and charged $375 per hour for coaching.

You don't HAVE to have an extremely high ticket offer to do this, but it is better to have multiple offers in place (an offer stack) so you can start high and work your way down for those that can't afford your full blown offer.

The DM Script

Below you will find a script to use to turn random people on the internet into a few thousand dollars (while also transforming their life for the better).

This script is not set in stone. You will have to use your judgment when going through this.

Don’t think of this as a script. Think of it as a 7 Step Framework. Seriously, use your own tone of voice with this. Talk like you are having a conversation over text.

Note: After EVERY SINGLE ONE of these messages \- if they do not respond within 24 hours, reply with a check-in message.

Example: “Hey \_\_\_\_\_\_, just wanted to bump this up. I’m interested in hearing about those goals.”

Some people won’t respond, this is why follow-ups are necessary.

The real money is made in the follow-ups.

Let’s dive in.

1\. Initial Message (Outbound)

Hey \_\_\_\_\_\_, I noticed you commented on my last post about \_\_\_\_\_\_. What was it that resonated with you?

This message can be anything really. Except for “hi,” don’t do that.

If they sent YOU a DM first, reply to their message and transition into the next steps.

Add Firepower To This Step:

Send a 1-2 minute video message talking directly to them  
Send a voice message if possible (unfortunately Twitter doesn't have this yet)

The more you can personalize this message \- the better.

2\. Transition

That’s awesome, I’m glad it could have an impact. I’m curious, what do you do for work? And what are you trying to achieve in (niche industry)?

Here we transition into a qualifying question and finding out where they want to be.

You should be able to tell if they can afford your services based on what they tell you from the first question.

The second question is to understand if you can actually help them accomplish something worthwhile.

3\. Details

(Comment on their work), how are those goals coming along?

They may answer this question early \- if that’s the case, move on to the next question.

4\. Roadblock

(Acknowledge what they said), what's holding you back from getting there quicker?

Make them realize they need help so you can position yourself as the solution.

5\. Visualize Their Transformation

(Acknowledge what they said), where are you looking to take this? Sounds like you have a big vision for this.

Again, we are showing them a possibility of a transformation and making them WANT it.

6\. Offer Help

(Acknowledge), I’ve helped quite a few people get (X results, plug a case study if you have one). I have a few suggestions that can help you get there. You open to take this connection offline and get on the phone soon?

If they say yes...

Awesome, I'll send you over a questionnaire so we don't have to waste a bunch of time on the phone.

7\. Send Questionnaire Link

Self-explanatory.

8\. Send Calendar Link To Qualified Prospects

Read through the questionnaire answers, ask the prospect more questions if you have to, and use your judgment on whether or not you actually want to take the call.

If you are new to this \- take as many calls as you can and just offer free advice. Give them actionable steps to fixing their situation. A few of them might even sign on with you \- or at least come back to you when they are ready.

Hope this helps for my fellow high ticket biz people.

# How To Create An Authentic Yet Compelling Bio

As some of you know, I'm notorious for changing my bio.

Well, I was... I haven't changed it in a while now that I've "figured it out."

But, I know people still struggle with crafting the perfect bio, and it makes sense as to why.

You feel like you have to:

Flex a crazy achievement to prove your authority  
Be as clear as possible so people understand what you do  
Fit every single thing imaginable into it (your topics, products, lead magnets, other links, and accomplishments)

With this post, I want to show you that all of this is as simple as being honest.

What Is Positioning?

Positioning is how you manipulate how your brand is perceived.

It is also how you manipulate your content, product, or copywriting of any sort – but we are here to talk about the top of funnel... how you position YOU and your brand.

It is the angle that people view you from.

It is the perspective that you plan to share with others, a perspective that they can follow along with.

So, let's just say that positioning is "perspective" in this case.

Now, what is a perspective composed of?

A goal that you are working towards – What broad goal are you trying to accomplish in your life? Financial freedom, mental clarity,

Where you are now and where you've been – What have you overcome in your life? How can you help others overcome those same things?

What you are doing to reach that goal – What are you learning? What are you building? How are those going to help others achieve that same goal? This is unique to you... others can have the same goal but a different way of getting there.

Take some time to answer all of those questions, as that will give you firepower to create a more authentic bio for yourself.

Let's run through an example:

My goal) Help other's reach their potential.

I understand the market and know this sounds a bit cheesy, so I don't explicitly say this.

Where I am / Where I've been) Tried every creative or marketable skill, failed at niche business models, and now use all of those skills as a personal brand.

What I'm doing to reach my goal) Studying philosophy, spirituality, and mastery while building a portfolio of digital products.

To make this even more simple and avoid sounding cheesy, here's a great bio template:

"I write about X, Y, and Z. Building: X"

Why does this work? Because it implies the goal that you are trying to achieve. It shows that you are a leader.

It is unique to you and you can avoid cheesy buzzwords relating to the broad goal you are trying to achieve.

Just Be Honest

Too many people overcomplicate this, so I want to show 2 great examples from Sahil Bloom & Justin Welsh.

Sahil has 722 THOUSAND followers with this as his bio, "exploring my curiosity and sharing what I learn along the way."

Is Sahil worried about his niche? Or is he worried about distilling the information that interests him and sharing it in an interesting way so he can attract interested people?

"Building a portfolio of one-person businesses to $5M in revenue."

That is Justin's goal.

Notice how he doesn't say "I built a one-person business to $5M in revenue."

Instead, he repositions the goal in a way that makes someone want to follow along.

People don't care what you're going to do, they care about what you are doing and what they can learn from you.

The point being, if you are a true leader, and actively pursuing a better life for yourself, all you have to do is be honest in your bio.

What are you studying? What are you building? How does it help others?

Answer those 3 questions and you'll have a trustworthy bio that brings in more followers than the dude flexing $100 billion dollar companies.

How This Transfers Over To Content

This does not only apply to your bio.

It applies to the content you are posting as well.

People always think, "I can't write about that, I don't have enough experience."

The thing is, you don't have to give actionable advice based on what YOU have done.

Instead, you can reposition from creation to curation and talk about something rather than at someone.

Instead of the headline:

"I've made $1 million in 30 days. Here's how you can do the same."

You can write:

"Alex Hormozi made $1 million in 30 days.

I reverse-engineered exactly how he did it.

Here's how I will use these principles to make $1M in 365 days:"

Simple, believable, and relatable.

You see what we did there?

We are curating content and advice in alignment with the goal that your brand is leading people toward.

That's all content is.

You can read, repurpose, and copy ideas if you want to.

When you apply them to what you are building and the goal you are trying to achieve, they become unique to you.

# How To Network, Grow, And Get Eyes On Your Content (Without Paying For Shares)

This process started as a Twitter thread, turned into a module in the Digital Economics cohort, then was used to help people get eyes on their writing in the my new course (2 Hour Writer).

I've seen people land jobs, have tweets go viral with little followers, and gain hundreds if not thousands of followers from doing this.

People usually fall into one of two camps:

Don't understand the sheer power and network effect of DMing people on a consistent basis  
Don't understand that you can get large accounts to share your posts (if you are strategic enough

DMs are how you network, grow, and get eyes on your content as a beginner (or whenever you want to get more traffic to your content).

But, most people suck at DMs.

Seriously. It's a problem.

Never, and I repeat never ever ever expect a response if all you send is:

Hi or hey  
How are you  
Can you follow me back  
A straight sales pitch with no prior connection  
A long block of text that takes too much time to read (especially if the sentences aren't spaced out)

You have to approach DMs tactically. Especially if you are reaching out to a big account that gets 10+ DMs an hour and probably doesn't check them (they usually skim over them to see if there is anything important).

Again, put yourself in the other person's shoes and think for a second. How can you stand out from the sea of crappy DMs that don't provide a shred of value before asking for something in return?

7 Steps To Non-Needy Networking

Knowing how to communicate and DM another person that you want to connect with will open up opportunities to paid work, social leverage, and meeting high-level people. You can use this strategy to:

Get a 50,000+ follower account to retweet your thread that will result in massive growth (the same goes for any other social platform sharing your post)  
Have connections that will share new growth strategies with you (Dickie Bush just sent me a LinkedIn tip the other day out of nowhere, I feel compelled to return the favor now)  
Join or create mastermind groups and begin forming your tribe (that you will grow with for much of your social media journey)  
To put your name in more peoples mouths. The more people that know about you, the more work and potential connections will be sent your way. Get your name in front of as many eyes as possible.

Here are the 7 steps of Non-Needy Networking:

1\) Find somebody that you WANT to DM

This is not exclusive to making connections. It is crucial for paid work as well.

The common theme among service businesses (like freelancers and agencies) is that their life is a living hell if they do not resonate with the client they are working with.

Reach out to people that:

You are inspired by  
You would want to work with  
You would want to strategize with  
You see potential for mutual benefit

When you are just starting out, you will have to work your way up the ladder. Start by DMing people that are within your follower range.

Once you have an audience and leverage, you can really reach out to anybody and get a warm response.

Where can you find people to DM?

The "following" list of accounts that you like

In the reply area of one of your mentors (if people are replying, it is implied that they are trying to grow and network)

Those are the main two areas to find people without using any fancy prospecting tools.

2\) Send them an inspired compliment

Find a piece of their content, work, or current projects that you are truly inspired by. Send it to them and tell them how it resonated with you.

This requires you to actually like their work

People love praise — and per the principle of reciprocity — will feel obligated to repay this soft favor.

An example for a tweet on managing emotions:

What's up Dan, this tweet hit me hard. I've been going through it the past couple of days and this instantly gave me some relief. Thank you. \[add the link to the post\]

Simple as that.

3\) Show interest in them

If they don't respond, you can try reaching out again in the same manner.

Showing interest is communication 101 — showing interest makes you interesting.

Ask them about:

Their goals  
What they are building  
What they do for work

This gives you the opportunity to give value (even if YOU don't have value to give right now).

Let's assume they respond with the generic "thank you so much."

Now, you can either find what they are working on from their profile or just ask them.

If you find what they are working on:

What are your next plans with Modern Mastery? It's been crazy seeing it grow, I'm curious what you've got in store.

If you can't find what they are working on:

Do you have anything that you're building right now? With that kind of content you must have something bigger in the works.

4\) Lead with value

This is the part that trips most people up.

Your first options are to:

See where you can help  
Send actionable tips  
Send resources, systems, or videos you've created or remember off the top of your head

Don't go straight for a transaction when you haven't given anything first.

If you have to ask more questions in order to send better actionable tips or resources, do it.

By resources I mean YouTube videos, articles, or anything that may be able to help them — or would pique their interest.

If you have no value to give you can:

Send a resource that can help them with their goals  
Connect them with someone else in your network  
Just continue having a good conversation and showing interest

Show that you are interested in helping them.

5\) Get on a call to make a deeper connection

This part is optional but recommended. You can skip straight to step 7 after a few days, but I would practice all of these steps at some point.

Making that "face-to-face" interaction is priceless. Nobody can see you, your personality, or your mannerisms via text.

When I was starting out, I was getting on zoom calls left and right with people that I wanted to get to know better. It's more normal than you think — and people are usually open to it when it is clear that you are just there to get to know them.

You can also take the conversation to somewhere like Telegram and send voice messages to make yourself seem more human. Most social accounts use Telegram and Whatsapp groups to communicate and strategize.

6\) Follow up with value

Remember their goals and keep an eye out for any content, resources, or people you can send their way. When you find something or someone, send it to them.

I remember you telling me about your plans for \[their project or goal\]. I found this today and thought you'd find it helpful.

"This" can be a YouTube video, article, lead magnet you found, or a person you connected with that may be able to help them.

7\) Follow up with an ask

By this point you've built a pretty damn solid connection. You've given value to the point where they are ready to return the favor. From here you can:

Ask them to join a mastermind group  
Send them one of your posts that you put a lot of time into  
Ask any specific questions you have for them without paying for consulting

If your plan is to leverage their audience for growth, be sure to write a post that they would want to share. Then, you can send it to them and mention that they inspired that post.

Yo, just wrote this up and thought you'd enjoy it. It was inspired by our previous conversation.

Do not ask them to retweet it. Let them engage with it however they see fit.

Even if you don't get a retweet or share, any engagement will help more people see it — helping you grow.

You should be reaching out to people almost every day. If you are immersing yourself in the environment of your interests, you should see inspirational people that you want to reach out to on a daily basis.

If you want to increase the chances of larger accounts responding to your DMs — follow them and engage with their content for a few days before reaching out so they are familiar with your face and profile picture.

A Few Words Of Advice

1\) If you plan on making an income or growing over the years as a creator, DMs are not optional.

You have to be consistent with meeting new people until you form a tribe that you can grow with (like I have with Joey and a few others.)

Aim for 5-10 DMs per day. Incorporate it into your engagement time blocks if that is something you are doing.

2\) If people aren't responding or sharing you, it's probably because your content isn't that good.

In that case, go through the Social Media Strategy category here, or check out The 2 Hour Writer for how to write with impact, my content ecosystem, and designing the lifestyle of a writer.

3\) This takes time, be patient.

Some people will see results after the first DM, some after their 30th.

There are subtle nuances to language and confidence that correct themselves with time. Everyone is at a different part of their journey, and if you are just starting yours, nothing will help you more than "putting in the reps."

Certain teachings won't resonate with you because your experience limits what you can perceive and interpret as useful.

# How To Capture Attention & 10X Your Engagement

People don’t remember what you say, they remember how you make them feel.

This is worth repeating:

Humans are emotional beings, not logical.

99% of the population have not developed themselves to the point of being free from — or in control of — their ego.

That is the foundation of capturing and holding attention.

Poking your reader’s ego.

Feeding it \= making them feel “good.”

Starving it \= making them feel “bad.”

If you can take people on an emotional journey of love, hate, excitement, deceit, calmness, and any other emotion that eventually ends in a benefit for their life — you have mastered the art of content creation.

Dan's 10 Koemmandments Of Capturing Attention

As you are scrolling through social media or just reading content in general — try to keep an eye out for these tactics being used. That is the best way to solidify this information in your head. Notice when your attention is being captured and question “why.”

There are many ways to capture attention. I’ve found these to be the most replicable and practical (number 8 is the most important):

1\) Specific Numbers

Using numbers in your hooks, headlines, or tweets will make people stop to see what the numbers relate to.

These can be in the form of:

Statistics — “There are 7 billion people on this earth”  
Dollar amounts — “Apples new $1175 iPhone has this new feature”  
Metrics — “I sent 322 cold emails” or “After 293 days…”  
Lists — “7 bad habits that are preventing you…”  
The more specific the number is, the more it catches peoples attention.

If you can’t make it super specific, that’s fine. Don’t stress it.

Here’s a recent example:

2\) Pattern Interrupts

A pattern interrupt is something that breaks people out of their normal conditioned patterns.

If someone is scrolling on Twitter and used to a lot of political commentary, a well formatted list tweet will make them stop their scroll.

Most of the things in this list are pattern interrupts.

3\) Negativity Bias

The human brain is wired to remember and pay attention to negativity.

This does not mean you have to be negative all the time.

It means you need to use the negative forms of words.

If you are saying something positive, but the point is better illustrated in its negative form, use that.

“You are going to achieve great things.”

Compared to:

“You will never hit rock bottom again.”

The second is most potent. We remember negativity. It is the most relatable aspect of many peoples’ lives.

It can still be a positive message while leveraging the reader’s negativity bias.

4\) Group Callout

This is simple, call out the specific person you are talking to.

If you are in your 20’s…  
Calling all creators, coaches, and freelancers\!  
Fathers are a gift to humankind…  
Even if your audience doesn’t fall into the specific group you are calling out, it will allow them to “pick a side” and compare themselves to what you are saying.

I talked about bodybuilders the other day. Even if people don’t consider themselves one, it helps paint a picture that they can relate to:

If someone talks about being a father, I can still relate because I will be a father one day. I will still pay attention to and take the advice.

This also works when it comes time to promote. You can call out exactly who the promotion is for and paint a picture of the problems they are struggling with.

5\) Problem Callout

Calling out the pains or problems people are experiencing will also make them relate to the post.

MOST people have encountered the same problem or pain as everyone else throughout their life.

If you can describe the feeling accurately, you have attention at your fingertips.

You don’t have to be dead on with this. Simply describing pain points will have people trying to relate their experiences to it. If they can relate, they will engage.

Here’s an example of calling out a pain as simple as “feeling terrible:”

6\) Potential Benefit

The opposite of calling out a problem. Again, pains and benefits. Your mind needs to think in pains and benefits. That is your unique “why” behind whatever “what” or “how” you are writing about.

7\) Social Proof

Again this is authoritative and implied an information gap.

When you flex your results or credentials, people automatically assume that you know more than them. They will take your content more seriously and read to find the information they are “missing.”

This works 100x better when it isn’t viewed as a “flex.”

Justin Welsh is the current king of this:

Use social proof to illustrate a point you are trying to make.

8\) Confidence & Conviction

This is by far the most important point here.

You can create highly impactful tweets with confidence alone — it allows other aspects of attention-grabbing to fall into place.

You are right about everything at this very point in time in relation to your goals, vision, beliefs, values, and everything else that forms your perspective of reality.

Your job is to have confidence and conviction in your beliefs and a credible or clear argument to back them up (if you have to).

Everyone is on social media to be told what to do in a confident way. Nobody is secure in their actions, choices, and beliefs. They are looking for someone to confirm them with confidence and give them that clarity to act.

Tools you can use to sound more confident:

Eliminate words that imply uncertainty  
Speak in absolutes when possible  
Exaggerate your point to add energy

Of course, do not abuse these for the sake of engagement.

Rather than saying:

“It may be wise if some people developed their skillset.”

Say:

“It is crucial that everyone on planet earth develops their skillset.”

Just by being confident, the words flow easier and the writing is more impactful.

I can go on to back that argument up with statistics or more creative firepower that I have in my mind.

Here is an example of me being confident in what I was saying:

This tweet got featured in a big newsletter and sparked a lot of controversy.

People were arguing whether or not it was the “greatest” skill. Some were proposing what their greatest skill was.

This made people comment and quote tweet, leading to more engagement and impressions.

I wrote this tweet in the moment when I had executed on an idea quickly. Doing that gave me a lot of joy, so I wanted to share that joy with others. It worked.

Is it 100% correct? No.

Was it 100% correct when I wrote it, through my perspective, relating to my personal experience?

Yes. At the time I was 100% convinced that that was the greatest skill.

I went on to add nuance in the replies. If I had added nuance in the actual tweet, it wouldn’t have done as well and opened up the opportunity to be featured in a big newsletter.

The people YOU want to attract aren’t the people that “hate” on your work.

Here is one other — a bit more extreme — example. Can you sense the motivational and practical energy “flowing through the screen?”

By the way, these types of high-energy advice posts pull in quite a bit of followers.

In summary — have some conviction behind what you are saying. This is not a skill that needs to be trained. It’s just a matter of writing the words in the most impactful way. Leaders don’t dance around the point they are trying to get across.

9\) Active Voice

Active voice implies that there is a story. It eases people into what you are saying.

Passive voice is often boring and gives away the “mini-story” too early. There is no anticipation that makes people want to figure out what happened next.

When you are practicing writing tweets, go through this article and edit out any passive voice you are using.

This also helps with being perceived as confident.

10\) Warnings & Cautionary Advice

What should people look out for when they are trying to achieve something?

Can you warn them of something they will encounter as they are trying to reach where you are now?

When you are doing your weekly reflection, or just reflecting on your life, what roadblocks can you help people navigate?

This is best illustrated with this tweet. I hit on a hot topic like dopamine and warned them of another hot topic (then wrapped it up with confidence).

This sparked a LOT of controversy, but I have research to back up that point AND gave nuance in the replies to build a deeper connection with my audience:

# The Viral Content Repurposing Machine

I don't know why I hadn't made this connection before, so with this post I want to give you a simple, actionable, and highly effective strategy for social growth on all platforms.

We should all understand content repurposing at this point — but there is a foolproof way of going about it.

We will talk about

Generating ideas that have already done well and have viral potential  
Structuring a list-style post that can be guaged for engagement  
How to post that list on all other platforms  
Turning the list into a viral thread  
Using the thread as a carousel or YouTube video

In this case, Twitter is our "virality tester" — you will understand soon.

And before we start — this can easily turn cheesy and hurt your account. Be mindful of the Social Matrix and mix it up between purely growth and authority posts.

Viral Idea Generation  
We've talked about this before in this post. Here's a brief overview:

The internet has already vetted ideas for us. We can have a rough estimate of what content will do well by what has already done well – or what is currently doing well. This means looking for

YouTube videos that have a lot of views (or are in your favorite creators videos sorted by popularity)  
Medium articles that show up on your homepage based off of your interest  
Top articles that show up when you search for your topic on Google (example: type "best habits" into Google)  
Top tweets from creators in your niche  
You can type "from:thedankoe min\_faves:500" in the twitter search bar to find tweets of mine that have gotten over 500 likes. You can do this for any creator, just replace the handle after "from:"  
I use TweetHunter both for ideas and to schedule my content with ease  
Pinterest, Instagram, TikTok \- I have not figured out how to find the best posts, but if they get high engagement you can take them

Now, we have an idea for a post — preferably one that aligns with your Content Pyramid and/or a section from your product/service if you plan to sell at the end.

Write A List Style Tweet  
Like this:

This is a poor example... for a reason. Anyone can write a "7 things I wish I knew as an 18-year-old" list (and that will always do well). 

But really anything can be turned into a list, like the above pic. That would eventually turn into a thread like, "The 3 reasons modern humans are unhappy:" (This could be tweaked to do better of course).

Why a list-style tweet?

It gives people multiple options to "agree" with one of your points, making it more likely for them to engage  
It acts as a pattern break on consumer's timelines because they follow their friends as well, who would never write a list tweet  
Humans love lists. They are more likely to read bullet points over anything else.  
They are the main style of content I wrote when I was a beginner and led to the most growth.  
Since it is just a tweet, you can use it as a test to see how much engagement a thread (or other posts) would get

Posting To Other Platforms  
This part is simple, you can:

Screenshot, edit, and post the screenshot of the tweet to platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.  
Create a reel, TikTok, or YouTube short according to what will work for the platform

Here's an example of a post that has always been going viral on TikTok. When you pair it with viral sounds, you are pretty much guaranteed growth.

And here's an example of posting on Instagram (if you include the likes and retweets in the image, it acts as social proof that gets people to engage. The idea is already validated to them)

Then, if you wanted, you could post that to LinkedIn, or just rewrite the Tweet on there.

Turn The List Into A Viral Thread  
I'm sure you've all seen what is doing well lately on Twitter. Dakota as an example has been killing it with these threads (he has been somewhat of a trendsetter in this regard).

Others are copying him and following his lead quick.

The easiest way to stand out and not be lumped into the bunch of copycats is to just change the hook or headline according to The Ultimate Thread Writing Guide.

I'm sure you can see how the list tweets make this process simple.

Post the list tweet  
Use the points as subtopics in the thread  
Expand on those points in 1-2 tweets in the thread  
Add a call to action to subscribe to your newsletter at the end

This is what all of the big accounts do. They don't sell on the timeline. They plug their newsletter and sell through there. You can sell on autopilot if you've gone through the Email Marketing Roadmap.

Repurpose The Viral Thread

Since these are so easy and streamlined to write (you already have the outline, it should take \~20 minutes to expand on each point into a thread), you can write 2-3 of these threads a week.

THEN, you can gauge engagement again, choose the one that did best, and post it as a carousel to Instagram or as a YouTube video.

Since these posts almost always do well on all platforms (because they are an evergreen content style), you will grow on YouTube. We will discuss why you aren't growing on other platforms in a bit.  
The Daily Process  
I would incorporate all of this into your content creation routine. It is simple and nearly automatic.

Remember, we are generating ideas from content that has already done well on other platforms. The idea is already validated and will do well IF you are getting eyes on it.

1\) Post a list-style tweet once a day.

This will result in growth on it's own, and has many other benefits for creativity and the mind.

Give it a day and gauge what it's engagement is. I wouldn't pay too much attention to this if you are a smaller account because engagement is inconsistent.

You can either store these tweets in a collection in TweetHunter or somewhere of your liking.

2\) Post something to Instagram, TikTok, or LinkedIn

According to whatever post did the best, use that as inspiration for a post on another platform. These do not all have to be list tweets.

3\) Give it a day or two, then turn it into a thread

Again, simple. Craft a good hook, expand on each point of the list tweet, and add a CTA to your newsletter or whatever you sell.

4\) Turn the thread into an Instagram carousel, LinkedIn article, Medium article, or YouTube script

Easy peasy and should take no longer than 3-4 hours a week for viral content that results in growth and sales.

Start Viewing Business As A Game  
Before we end, I want you to start viewing this as a game.

I see so many people destroying all chances of their growth because they let their ego get in the way.

"I'm too good for posting simple and actionable content"

 Don't complain when you aren't growing. It's not the algorithm, it's you.  
Understand that you probably read that basic content when you were starting out and wouldn't be here without it  
Understand that Twitter is top of funnel. The majority of your content is going to target the lower levels of awareness. Especially if your content topics are rather broad

See engagement, followers, and authority as a game.

How can you craft a tweet that will result in all of the above?

Getting Eyes On Your Profile  
If you aren't getting any traction on these posts:

You are just starting out and don't have any followers  
You aren't playing the game. You don't have a network you can send these to boost exposure and leverage other peoples audiences (the only other way to grow aside from commenting on everyone's posts, but that is time draining and demotivating. Just make friends and help each other grow)  
You are afraid to pay for retweets, story shares, or other types of paid growth that all of the big guys do. If I have an offer that sells, why would I not invest $500 to get my post exposed to 100,000 more people? The growth should pay for itself 5 times over.  
You aren't saying anything controversial, polarizing, or you aren't confident in the way you are writing it. Give people a reason to click on your profile.  
That's it\!

If you bake this into your content strategy I am confident you will see faster growth and newsletter opt-ins.

If you have any questions regarding this, post it in the Business Strategy or Writing and Idea Generation channel\!

# Evergreen VS Meta Growth Content

By now we have a solid understanding of what we should be posting on social media. We need to maintain an authoritative & authentic brand while still growing. If you are unaware of what I am talking about, read about the Social Matrix here.

When people neglect growth content, they either don't make it off the ground and quit — or they stall and remain around the same follower account for months (until they recognize its importance).

This is something I see all too often across all social media. It is a spiritual game. A matter of awareness. If you are not tweeting to the 90% of people that have a low level of awareness, how can you expect to grow quickly?

This is an ego problem for most, as they "don't want those type of people following them." Again... awareness. Your job is to raise their awareness / consciousness (through your funnel) to a point of being highly educated on a specific topic (that you teach).

Short-form social media platforms (Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YT shorts) do not allow depth. People are not on those platforms for depth. You have to play to the algorithm for the sake of filling your funnel to educate people and bring them to your level.

Ok... that was a bit long of an intro — but growth content is IMPORTANT. Especially as a beginner. Play the game until it becomes an art. In other words, do what you have to do until you can do whatever you want.

Evergreen Growth Content

There are a few content styles that have been on social media and blog platforms for the entirety of internet life. They are almost always a safe bet to emulate and schedule in your weekly / monthly content.

When I talk about evergreen content, I am including both the SEO definition and my own. SEO evergreen content means that it is relevant and will continue to garner traffic (blogs and YouTube have this). For other platforms like Twitter, evergreen content can be posted again and again from a different perspective to keep growth coming in. This is where TweetHunter thrives, as it teaches you how to write this content \+ gives you ideas and inspiration.

Evergreen content includes:

Listicles  
Quotes or "insights"  
"I tried XYZ and this happened"  
Personal stories  
Questions  
How to for beginners

Now, these all have specific ways that perform best on any given platform.

I've made a collection of some of my evergreen content-style tweets here so you can see how they would be posted.

The only ones that I didn't include where the "I tried" and "Quotes" style. But I could easily post a "After a week of daily beef liver, I got these benefits..." or quote my favorite author with "Alan Watts famously said..." and those would do well while bringing in some followers.

I would say that this is fairly apparent on most platforms. You understand what a listicle blog of YouTube video is. "7 Ways To Boost Your Confidence" and the rest. Now that you understand this, you will catch onto these trends more often.

You can see this done on Instagram as well. Carnivore Aurelius does list style posts and carousels very well. There are huge inspirational pages that do quote style posts well. And of course there are niche accounts that have a ton of "How to for beginners" style content.

Again, all of these are great for growth and should take up the majority of your content, but you need authority and authenticity style content as well. Especially if you are a personal brand and / or plan to monetize.

Since I've started on TikTok, I've noticed that these evergreen content styles are still on the platform, just posted in a way that favors TikTok style content. Can you tell what a listicle style post looks like on Twitter by looking at my TikTok? (Not the ones with my tweets pasted on a bg video).

The lesson of all of this that many people miss: YOU HAVE TO POST EVERGREEN GROWTH CONTENT. ESPECIALLY AS A BEGINNER. Stop trying to post like a 100K follower account that can get engagement on everything.

Meta Growth Content

TikTok made me very aware of current "metas" on social media. Jak Piggot is a prime example of milking a specific content style that does well and growing like crazy. I am emulating him and have grown to 4K in a week thanks to Jimmy Farley's TikTok course.

From what I've seen, the content that is favored to most is a crossover between evergreen content and HOW it is posted on the platform.

"I Tried X For Y Days" is going crazy on YouTube right now.

Long-form listicles are going crazy on Medium and Twitter right now \- Millenial Money Woman is a prime example with her threads.

TikTok has it's own trends (obvious) that go crazy all the time.

And Instagram... I'm honestly not sure. There algorithm is all over the place and I can't seem to figure it out lol.

There is no way of knowing what the current meta will be. All you can do is keep an eye on social media and see what starts to do well. Create your own swipe file and write content that emulates certain styles that start to do well.

If you have any questions regarding evergreen or meta content, feel free to pop them in the Lounge\!

I have some incredible posts lined up over the coming weeks. I will be continuing the product build to 6 figures and posting my current TikTok strategy just because it has so much potential to drive traffic.

# How To Tell A Joke (And 10X The Impact Of Your Writing)

The other day I watched a YouTube video that broke down the joke writing process. This brought to light some of my "unconscious competence" when it comes to writing tweets (or other content).

I wanted to share it with you all — as this will serve as a primer for a content writing live session that we will have soon.

This process has birthed some of my best Tweets.

The only difference between a good joke and impactful content is the degree of seriousness.

Before we start:

I have a feeling that many people starting out on Twitter (or any other platform) thinks that writing short-form content is quick and easy. It CAN be, but not at first.

When I was at 300 followers or so I would lay in my bed at midnight staring at my screen trying to think of a tweet idea. I would refine it to perfection and would not go to sleep unless I had content scheduled.

If you eliminate the expectation of it being "easy" at first, you will build a writing habit and it will become second nature over time. You have to put in the reps and time to get better at this.

The Joke Writing Process  
When comics are writing a joke, there are a few crucial steps.

Step 1\) Just Start Writing.

Seriously, just start. Write down one word. One topic. Write down a series of words. Write down a sentence that pops into your head.

You need SOMETHING written in order to get ideas flowing in the direction of that word. The act of writing down ONE word/sentence gives you something to iterate on.

Once you have something written, finish the thought and write anything else that may come to mind.

Personal experiences  
Feelings associated with the topic  
Pains or benefits associated with the topic  
Answer the question: "What's in it for me?" (the reader)  
Brainstorm the "how" and "why" behind the topic you wrote down  
Etc

By now, you should have a sentence or two. It may be coherent, it may not be. That's okay.

If you need help with inspiration or idea generation, I use TweetHunter (as do most of the people that write good content).

Step 2\) Create A Setup

In content, this is known as the hook. In a story, this is the setting — or giving context to what you are going to say.

Standup comedians need to set up the context before the punchline, or else the joke will flop.

Storytellers need to paint a picture of the scene, or else you won't be able to follow the story. There will be a lack of depth.

How can you frame the topic in an interesting way?  
How can you grab people's attention and spark curiosity for what's next?  
What is a problem / experience that people go through related to the topic?  
What is the big idea that you are trying to get across?  
Do you have a story / experience that you can set the scene for?

Again, you can use something like TweetHunter for good hook inspiration, or you can scroll through Twitter, YouTube, Medium, or Instagram (EVERYTHING you see is a hook, some good some bad).

Step 3\) Get Specific

This is where true virality, laughs, and relatable stories happen — by getting specific.

What are the steps to achieving/relieving the benefit/pain?  
Can you use a metaphor to help explain your point? Here is a viral tweet of mine that uses a metaphor — and another one here  
Can you use numbers or percentages? This helps capture attention  
From your personal experiences — can you describe emotions, feelings, or actions with depth?

Specificity is all about relating to the reader and making them understand what you are trying to put across.

Here's what is going through the reader's mind as they are scrolling:

"Oh wow, this is so me"  
"Damn, that hits deep"  
"I believe the same thing, thanks for the confirmation"  
"I agree with this" (think of the like and RT button as "I agree")

They aren't saying that exactly, but those are helpful for guaging the potential impact of your idea.

Another thing you can think about: would YOU like, retweet, and click on the user's profile if you saw the tweet on your timeline.

Step 4\) Use Your Favorite Framework / Template

This part is optional, but effective. There are dozens if not hundreds of ways to structure a story, sales copy, or anything else that grabs and holds attention.

AIDA (attention, interest, desire, action)  
Headline, lead, body, conclusion  
Listicles ("the top 7 habits of 2022")  
One liner tweets  
Anything you can find in TweetHunters dashboard or resources

Many people START with this part, but it becomes 10x easier when you already have the idea fleshed out.

After you have a completed idea, you can then turn it into 3-5 different variations with the SCAMPER technique. You can learn more about that at the top of my master swipe file.

Writing A Tweet With This Process

Start:

The most effective thing you can do

Then (inspired by a previous tweet of mine):

The most effective thing you can do is block off 1 hour a day dedicated to the person you want to become

Idea that sparked after writing that: think of it as going on a date with yourself

Revised:

The most powerful thing you can do is set aside 1 hour a day for you and the person you want to become

Create a setup and get a bit more specific:

Set aside 1 hour a day for the 2 most important people in your life.

1\) You  
2\) The person you want to become

Specificity is there, punchline is there (but could be stronger):

Set aside 1 hour a day for the 2 most important people in your life:

No distractions, no phone, just you and the person you want to become.

Boom. There is a solid, specific setup and a semi relatable punchline. It has numbers, I don't give everything away upfront, and it makes people stop and think for a bit. It's also very easy to apply the advice.

I scheduled this tweet for tomorrow. If you want to see how it did, you can copy and paste this into the Twitter search bar:

from:thedankoe "Set aside 1 hour a day for the 2 most important"

I could EASILY turn that into 3-5 different variations and even a thread.

That's it for this post, we have a live content writing session on Wednesday — if you are reading this later, you will be able to find it in the Trainings tab.

# How I Made $3000 Per Month With 300 Followers On Twitter (With Digital Products)

The start of my Twitter journey was different from most. I had a background in marketing, was studying advertising, and understood my customer avatar (myself).

I bought my first Twitter growth guide without meaning to start a Twitter account... I was just a lurker at the time. I saw the opportunity and said "f\*ck it, why not."

My account started off with 110 or so followers, friends and family. I branded myself as the web design and mindset guy. The thing is, I didn't want to do it unless I was making a decent amount of money upfront. I had money coming in from freelancing, so this would just be the cherry on top. (This was before I realized the true power of Twitter, it's changed the direction of the business for good).

This is the earliest screenshot I have of my account, the timestamp is March 2020:

This is my Gumroad dashboard for January 2020:

I started my account in November 2019 \- so I'm estimating I was a bit above 300 followers.

This can also give you an example of compound growth. It took a bit to break 500, 1000, and 2000 followers. Although there are better ways of going about it then I did \- like how JK Molina outlines in this training.

Also...

This is excluding my freelance income (which also increased with Twitter). There are a multitude of trainings and articles on sales and prospecting on Twitter in here.

Double also...

This can be done with any product. There is no need to overcomplicate this process. If somebody else is selling a product that you have expertise in, you can sell your own version. (This is the best way to go about it).

Step 1\) Creating The Digital Product

My goal was to teach developers how to freelance with their web development knowledge.

I had bought many freelancing and web design courses in the past, so I knew it would sell. The idea was validated.

I could have been an affiliate for any one of them, but I figured I might as well make my own (since I had results and a different perspective) and take 100% of the profits.

Here's what I did to create the product in under a month:

Created a rough outline of the chapters I wanted in there  
Went back through the courses I previously took to fill in the gaps  
(Keep in mind this was for inspiration only, to make sure I was covering all bases in terms of topics I taught)  
Wrote the ebook during my focused work blocks (it ended up being \~100 pages double spaced)  
Brainstormed a title, subtitle, and cover image  
Went through the course landing pages that I had taken before, wrote down the benefits and pain points I could use for my own landing page  
Uploaded everything to Gumroad (no prelaunch or anything)  
Started promoting (more on this later)  
Built out my welcome and sales sequence for this product so I could sell on autopilot (Email Marketing Roadmap)

If I had taken my time to market it correctly (via the Advanced Marketing Roadmap), I probably would have made much more, but I just went with it.

Step 2\) Getting Traffic To The Offer

This is where many people go wrong... they want to make money without spending money. I wanted to grow a digital asset and sell my product, so I cut back my spending and started investing $500/month into my growth.

YOU NEED SEMI INTERESTED TRAFFIC (AND A GOOD OFFER) TO SELL YOUR PRODUCTS.

You cannot get these results at 300 followers if you are not willing to invest in paid traffic. (In this case, paid traffic \= retweets).

I paid a big account that was already selling a web design product for 30 retweets. I figured if they were teaching people web design, I could teach them to freelance with that skill (eventually I went on to create my own web design product because it paired well with the freelance product).

I would send the account my tweets daily, they would retweet, I would gain followers and profile visits, and I would promote the product accordingly.

(I also had the link and a call to action in my bio \- because I knew that many would look at my profile without following me... this got more sales than you would think)

It was that simple.

Create decent content  
Give actionable advice according to the product you are selling  
Promote the product  
Get eyeballs on your profile (free \= slow, paid \= fast, nothing wrong with either)

You are selling and growing at the same time.

Step 3\) Networking & Getting Affiliates

This happened by luck, but down the road (when I was closer to 1000 followers) I was trying to network with developer accounts.

I tried offering to pay one of the accounts, he was at 16K followers at the time and declined because he didn't think his retweets were worth the money.

Time went on and he realized that I was selling a freelancing product. He said, "oh man people ask me all the time how to freelance" so I offered to make him an affiliate.

He started promoting my product, bringing in an extra $1500 rev or so a month.

After my product had decent reviews and traction, I started looking for other affiliates.

Step 4\) Creating Complimentary Products and Iterating

After some time, I realized I didn't want to be the web design guy, so I started to pivot in how I was selling my products.

First, I created a web design product (Websites That Work) and launched that. I sold that for a bit as a standalone product.

Eventually, I combined the 2 into the "Modern Money Bundle" and started to target those that wanted to learn a skill and learn to sell it.

This extended the "shelf life" of these products. I was able to continue pulling in consistent revenue because I tested different angles and created new offers out of things that were already made.

Once I hit 10K followers, I created my Twitter course. Sold that on its own for a bit, then added it to the Modern Money Bundle.

Those sold for a bit longer, and are all now in the One-Person Business Roadmaps.

I hope you are all starting to see how this is a long-term game of persistence and iteration.

Happy Wednesday my friends.

# The Content Pyramid For Unlimited Ideas

I've gotten a lot of questions about The Content Pyramid lately, and when I think back to the first Twitter course I bought — mapping out my content pillars and ideas was the first thing I did.

If you are struggling with idea generation for content, this article is for you.

Let's start with these questions:

What are you good at?

What can you talk to your friends for hours about?

What do you want to learn more about that will make you (and those around you) a better person?

This is what you will be creating content about, and preferably helping others accomplish in exchange for money.

Following The Content Pyramid will give you unlimited ideas for tweets (and all other social posts and videos).

Pillars

Most personal brands, creators, coaches, or freelancers on social media have 2-5 content pillars. These are usually sub-markets.  
For clarification, the main markets are:

Health  
Wealth  
Relationships

Sub-markets are branches off of those:

Health   
Exercise  
Nutrition  
Mental health  
Wealth   
Business  
Investing  
Money management  
Relationships   
Dating  
Marriage  
Friendship

What are the sub-markets that you have the most experience in and want to pursue?

Don't overthink this too much \- it doesn't really matter if it's classified as a sub-market or not. What matters is that you have a broad market to work down from for relevant content ideas.

Topics

Think of topics as something you discuss with your friends for a few minutes \- or what you see in a YouTube video.

Topics are things that you can write a blog post on, create a video on, or just discuss (works for threads too).

On Twitter \- you don't really Tweet about topics as there is too much to fit into the 280 character count.

We need to write down topics for the sake of creating content.  
Examples for bodybuilding:

Weight training  
Gaining muscle  
Cutting

Examples for business:

Audience building  
Freelancing  
Marketing

You get the point \- and you can probably see the connections with "niching down" with everything related to marketing that we've talked about here.

Content

You can see where we are going with this... now we break them further into content ideas.

These can be used in many ways:

Blog posts  
YouTube videos  
Tweets/threads  
Instagram posts/carousels

Pretty much the same thing as Topics, but a tad more refined.

The Secret Sauce

Now we need to turn these content ideas into high-engaging posts.

I've been using Tweet Hunter as the start of all of my content creation. You can plug any of your content pillars, topics, or favorite accounts and study all of their best tweets. A tweet that does well is then turned into more content across all social media channels.

The BEST posts are relatable.

How do we make these pillars/topics/content relatable in a short and punchy way?

By understanding the benefits that they provide and the problems they solve.

Humans are emotional and selfish creatures... if something can help them, they will listen. If you pinpoint the problem they are having, they will listen.  
You can dive deeper into your target audience's problems by reading up on market research here.

What was your former mindset on the problem?  
Why did you implement the advice?  
What results were you hoping to get?  
What problem of yours were you trying to solve?  
What did you struggle with?  
What were your biggest “aha” moments?  
What were your objections?  
What did you struggle with the most?  
What do you wish you had done differently?  
What are you going to do to prevent that problem from happening again?

Ideas For Unlimited Content Creation

Per The Content Pyramid \- all of your tweets, in essence, are just words that dance around your reader's emotions. They should always have a heavy focus on:

Transformations   
Where they are now \- how it feels to be there, common experiences  
Where they want to be \- how it feels to be there, why its better than where they are now  
Exaggeration   
Make the deep pain points sound painful  
Use absolutes   
Never, always, best, worst \- no middle ground  
Stand firm in your beliefs (but be open enough to change them if you are proven wrong)  
Think about how the problem affects them from a health, wealth, or relationship standpoint.   
Building a business allows people to work from anywhere, from their laptop, and do what they want with their time (benefits). It also allows them to avoid wage slavery, fire their shitty boss, and escape the life-sucking cubicle (exaggerated pain points).  
Exaggerated pain points and benefits are key for one-liner tweets or at the end of a longer tweet to tie everything together.

Start looking for this in good tweets you see. Start forming the mental connections about what makes a tweet do well.

Good Headlines Make For Good Tweets

If a blog post is doing very well \- that usually means it will do very well on Twitter (this works for YouTube as well, not just blogs).  
One-off headlines are great for short tweets.

Example: If you want your content to stand out, learn how to break the rules.  
I just found that on Medium. I could tweet it out right now and probably get 300+ likes. (Remember to not just copy things word for word \- FOCUS ON THE IDEA YOU ARE TRYING TO CONVEY BEHIND THE TWEET. Be clear about it.)

Headlines make for great tweet topics.

Example: 9 signs a person is really happy with their life.  
That is the first line of your tweet, then list out the 9 things.  
These 9 points can also be turned into individual tweets.

Once you get the hang of high-performing tweet structures, these will start to write themselves naturally.

Find a huge community blog like Medium, Lifehacker, or one in your niche. Bloggers will usually post their own articles to these platforms \- pay attention to the ones that do well and use the headlines/content tactically.

Idea Generation Tactics

One of my favorite times of the day is my "Idea Generation Session." In other words, an intentional learning period where I:

Read articles on Medium or elsewhere related to my target audience and content pillars.  
Watch YouTube videos of the same.  
Read books or listen to audiobooks pertaining to my own interests or my audiences.

Keep a notepad, journal, or notetaking app next to you to jot down any idea that comes to your mind.

In short \- set aside time for consuming content that already does well.

Another great way to do this \- that we already touched on \- is creating a 'list' on Twitter of the accounts you aspire to be like, write like, and impact like. Spend some time reading over their tweets to keep their writing style fresh in your mind.

Again, I'd like to give a special mention to Tweet Hunter for doing this all for you. (this is the first step in my creative process).

This is a great way to "force" yourself to have relaxation time. It calms your mind and starts to make you think for yourself again. Twitter is notorious for polarizing views. Most other content is not.

Creating A Swipe File

Whenever a tweet passes by your eyes that makes you think, "Damn, I wish I wrote that," DO NOT let it just pass by. Copy and paste it somewhere safe (like Notion) so you can refer back to it when you need inspiration.

You can duplicate and study my swipe file here.

# The Evolution Of Your Content, Ideas, & Brand

I've seen way too many people getting discouraged lately that they aren't "on par" with bigger creators and brands. This is natural, it happened to me, so I want to break down my experience in the evolution of my brand — and the things you should focus on as you grow.

Your content, bio, message, and overall branding will be different at 100 followers than it will at 1,000 \- 10,000 \- and 100,000. You will refine your message, move away from "what works," and start creating ideas that can be tied to you.

This is the journey to exponential growth and authority.

(By no means is my journey perfect, but I will speak from my experience and what I have noticed working for others).  
Under 10,000 Followers

This is arguably the most difficult part of the journey. You are testing what kind of content you like writing rather than what content works (because you don't have an audience for feedback).

The best thing you can do is to emulate bigger brands. See what is working for them but understand that they already have leverage. Naval can have nothing in his bio. If you did that you would just look like an anon account.

The secret to this is crafting your bio as if you were a 10,000 follower account. People should think, "Wow I've found a little known gem\!"

Your Profile

1\) It needs to clearly state what you help people do.

You need to answer their question... "What's in it for me?"

You need to focus on the benefits of what you teach. If you talk about personal growth \- what are the tangible benefits of that? (That they actually care about?)

A great way to get this across is with this template. You don't have to use it word for word, but it will help you structure what you are trying to say:

Learn to ABC so you can XYZ

Or

Lessons on ABC so you can XYZ \- Tweets on ABC so you can XYZ

Example: Tweets on personal growth and holistic health so you can live stress free.

Simple as that.

There are more examples in this article on profile optimization.

2\) You should have a link to SOMETHING

People want to follow leaders. That's why they are called followers.

Leaders speak confidently and are open to feedback. (Confidence in your tweets is an engagement hack. People can sense it.)

Leaders provide value. They teach. They have some form of a resource for someone to download or buy. If you are afraid of selling, this is even more reason to do it. So you can get over that fear.

Start an email list (even if you aren't going to write emails yet.) Write a free guide. Create a product. Have a questionnaire to schedule a call with you. Anything. Show that you can give them something worth their time.

Consumers follow producers. So produce something deeper than surface level engageable content. Give them something MORE.

3\) Your pinned tweet should show some form of authority, social proof, or authenticity... again, "What's in it for me?\!?\!"

If you haven't watched the JK Molina training yet, watch it here. He breaks down how to grow to 2,000 followers the fastest way.

You should have either:  
A tweet about your story / transformation  
A tweet that has a lot of likes (social proof)  
A tweet that gives away so much good information people can't ignore it

Your Content

"One must be cringe before they can become based."

For MOST people — not all — you will have to post some cheesy content at the start. I was recently listening to a podcast with Jen Sincero and this is something that holds a lot of people back.

"Oh I don't want to post platitude content."

"List tweets? That's lame, there are too many."

"All I want to do is shitpost..."

Sorry.. not gonna happen. You are the only one that is aware of them being "cheesy."

Don't play the losing fight against human nature.

Put in the necessary reps until you're at a point where you can show a bit more personality.

Why can big YouTuber's post anything they want and still grow? Because people know them and they have social proof. They put in the initial reps.

They didn't start that way. Go look at anyone's account and you will see they all played nice with the algorithm. They got views, engagement, followers, and then slowly started to do whatever they want.

As Jack Butcher put it: "Build distribution, then build whatever you want."

If you want a cheatcode to content you can create, check out my swipe file here and plug your ideas into them as templates.

Focus Areas

Writing 3 quality tweets per day (focused on growth)  
Long list tweets give people more reasons to follow you  
Confident, pain or benefit focused basic content \- speak in absolutes  
Highly actionable content. Step by step how to achieve a desired result, in the form of a list or thread.  
Check out this article on the best content to write (this works extremely well).  
Engaging with 10+ people per day  
Forming mastermind groups and making lifelong friends  
This is arguably the most important step  
Getting your content retweeted by paying for promotions or networking with big people

Under 20,000 Followers

From 1,000 to 20,000 (ish) you will be introducing the authenticity side of your brand. Authority, authenticity, and growth all interconnect... and its not like you avoid any of them along the way — but now you are consciously putting effort into the more "human" side of your brand.

You are doubling down on what has worked for growth. Paying attention to what people respond to, and starting to form your message.

This is important. Stop stressing about your niche or content pillars. Talk about what you want in a way that will result in growth. You will naturally find your talking points. I cannot teach this. It must be done on your own.

Keep posting lists. Test new kinds of tweets. Incorporate your own flare or humor.

At this point, things are getting easy.

Focus Areas:

Consistent, high quality content  
Connecting with higher level players since you have some social capital  
Maintaining relationships with those you've connected with in mastermind groups (keeping friendships and helping each other grow)  
Building out systems for your content creation  
Turning tweets into email topics  
Using TweetHunter to write weeks worth of tweets so you can focus on building and selling offers  
Spending time absorbing information from your "Tribe of Mentors" (big brands you aspire to be like)

Under 50,000 Followers

At this point you have your main talking points. It's time to ideate these and make them yours.

Your job is to start coining names for your ideas or speaking on specific things.

Examples:  
The One Person Business Model (freelancing, coaching, creating)  
Lifestyle Design (productivity, flow)  
A portfolio of small bets (Daniel Vassalo's way of saying "throw shit at a wall and see what sticks")  
Build Once, Sell Twice (Jack Butcher's way of saying build digital products that you can sell infinitely)

Think of this as simplifying concept topics into a memorable "label"

This will only help you grow faster. People will mention you in posts when they talk about your concept.

Next step: start branching out to other platforms in a sustainable way.

You've solidified your message, offer, and what you want to get across.

Podcasts are great for your brand's authenticity pillar. It builds a deeper connection and allows you to be vulnerable.

Consistent newsletters allow you to show authority or entertain your audience.

YouTube is powerful if you want to speak and create captivating videos.

Instagram is just a no brainer because everyone is on there.

You can use this template if you would like \- it will help you break down a long form post (that you can use for blog, email, YouTube script, etc) into tweets, reels, Instagram posts and the rest.

Focus Areas:  
Twitter is on autopilot now  
Start learning the other platforms you are trying to grow on  
Create systems for content creation and make it easy on yourself  
Have one project that you are building out at a time (offer, book, community)

50,000+ (My Current Strategy)

At this point, I'm coasting. I don't have to do much to continue growing. I've gone through my "cheesy" phase and I can start to build real authority.

I plan on playing LONG term games with short term initial payouts.

ITERABLE GAMES: Do the things that make you look back and make you cringe at yourself.

The podcast is starting slow but is picking up momentum.

YouTube is slowly growing without me having to post content for the algorithm.

I am writing and publishing a book. Trying to make it a NYT bestseller so I can tap into top tier personal brand's networks and infinitely scale through their platforms.

The Power Planner 2.0 will be a staple in peoples days.

Kinda like world domination (for good\!) on a micro level.

I hope this post was insightful. If you have any questions pop em in the \#business-strategy or writing-and-idea-generation channel\!

# Long Form Content & Thread Template For Content Multiplication

In my time of writing emails, threads, and other content... I got frustrated with how spread out and chaotic everything seemed. A new idea for every single one across all platforms. It's kinda impossible.

So, I systemized things and came up with 2 different long-form content templates.

You can write these as blog posts, emails, threads, or YouTube scripts \> use them interchangeably over time \> turn them into multiple short form tweets and posts \> turn YT videos in clips \> etc

Here is the long-form content multiplication template I made. It should be self-explanatory and give good structure for any long post.

You can duplicate the Notion template here and start toying with it\!

I also have a thread planner that you can use. This one can be a bit clunky but is a bit more tailored to threads as opposed to a long blog or email.

I would encourage you to look through both and see which you like better if any.

You can duplicate the thread planner here.

There is a "How To Use" video under the first dropdown toggle.

Enjoy\!

# The Ultimate Twitter Thread Writing Guide

In preparation for our 7 Days of Threads Sprint in the Discord community, here is a thread writing masterclass.

Why should you care about threads?  
They bring in a massive amount of followers. The longer and more in depth they are, the more followers they bring.  
They are great for sales. Just plug your product / lead magnet at the end.  
You can repurpose them into tweets, emails, blog posts, YouTube scripts, and any other content.  
They build authority, trust, and a deeper connection with your audience.  
If you can get people to retweet them, you can grow from 0-1K followers faster than ever.

Threads are just expanded tweets. Keep this in mind when you are deciding the intention of your thread.

I would recommend reading over The Social Matrix to understand the growth, authenticity, and authority pillars.

Is it for growth?  
Tweet your story or a part of your story  
Most threads (no matter growth, authenticity, or authority) will result in growth.

Is it for authenticity?  
Tweet your personal experience or struggles you've overcome  
Document what you are going to do while you are "building in public"

Is it for authority?  
Drop massive value relating to what you teach.  
Give beginners step by step advice.  
Call out your audience and tell them what they are doing wrong.  
IF IT IS FOR AUTHORITY \- Call out your audience in the eyebrow.

Threads, when done right, are a mixture of all 3\. The primary intention of the thread should be focused on growth and authority \- sprinkle in authenticity by writing in your own voice, like you are talking to a friend.

How To Pick A Thread Topic

There are a few types of threads that do very well:  
A numbered list (like a blog) with short or long insights about each point.  
A story of yourself or a client that accomplished something your audience wants to accomplish. (Think transformations)  
Search for multiple variations of an idea you have on Google and make your own spinoff of a blog or YouTube video headline.  
Calling out a problem your target audience and teaching them how to solve it.

This part should be easy. Type parts of your Content Pyramid into Google, YouTube, or just go off the top of your head.

(Your content pyramid is a breakdown of your main topics into sub-topics into content ideas).

DO NOT SLEEP ON THIS METHOD. It has brought previous people in the program hundreds of followers a day. The Google, Medium, or YouTube content is already proven to do well. Take the idea, watch the video, and write about the topic in your own words. "Steal like an artist."

Principles of Thread Writing

Don’t be afraid of writing in-depth content, but make sure that your first impression will leave the reader hungry for more.

Threads are about two things:  
Giving your unique perspective on a particular topic  
Building your expertise and authority on the Twitter space

Threads are like writing a sales letter.

The components are the same:  
Hook \- attention grabbing first line (optional)  
If this is for authority \- call out your audience here.  
"If you are X, Y, Z..."  
Describe the big problem about the topic you are going to discuss. How does it affect your audience? BE SPECIFIC.  
Headline \- mention the big problem you plan to solve and why it needs to be solved.   
Read this blog article on how to write killer blog headlines (these work well for threads)  
Deck \- Introduces the story with curiosity (optional)  
Lead \- AFTER the first tweet in the thread. The lead paints a picture of the problem people are having and hints at a solution.  
Social Proof \- Tell people why they should listen to what you have to say on that topic. (optional)

All are important, but the first tweet is the MOST important tweet of the thread. The first tweet contains the eyebrow, headline, and deck \- but sometimes it just works well with the headline.

If your first tweet sucks, your thread won't perform, so a lot of emphasis on writing your first tweet well (Which should be your eyebrow-headline-deck).

Here are some examples of great threads:

Highly Effective: Hook \+ headline that solves that desire

The Rest Of Your Thread

The way you want to structure a thread (or any type of content really) is by having a beginning/middle/end structure to it.  
Beginning \= hook \+ problem   
The hook includes the eyebrow, headline, and deck  
The problem is the lead (and usually takes up 1-2 tweets in length)  
Middle \= key talking points   
Think about how a blog article is structured with subcategories  
End \= closure/lesson learned and call to action   
Wrap up the thread with the lesson you learned or a recap on what the reader learned  
You have their attention \- so ask them to do something \- like buy a product, DM you for your services, download a lead magnet, and ALWAYS ask them to retweet the first tweet, it helps.  
If you have a product, you can offer to give it away free to one retweeter.

🔑 Remember, it's not about content length. It's not about the number of tweets. It's about providing valuable information and making your reader feel something.

An example of a failed thread:  
https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1352366082942775296?s=20

Another one from Nick but the initial tweet is too messy, it loses people's interest.

It doesn't have 1 big idea, it doesn't spark any curiosity, and I don't immediately see a "What's in it for me?" reason for me to continue reading.

🔑 Remember, curiosity \+ benefit (make the reader curious \+ give them a reason the read more) is the key for a thread to bang.

Getting Maximum Exposure

We all know networking is good \- but being able to send a thread to your network to retweet is an INSANE growth hack.

If you haven't already, start making friends in the DMs. DO NOT ask for a retweet if you have never DMd the person before. Make friends first, even if it's a very short conversation.

Once you have a network \- send them the tweet and be authentic:  
"Yo brother just wrote up this thread, would truly appreciate if you gave it an RT. If not, no worries, and if theres anything I can do for you let me know\!"  
If you have a decent following, you can offer to trade retweets (an example of exponential growth and social capital).

Adding Examples of People That Align With Key Points

If you want to guarantee that some tweets get good exposure, tag people that understand whatever topic you are talking about well.

If I write a thread on my fitness transformation and going on walks are a big part of that \- I could tag someone who also is a proponent of going on walks when I mention walks.

If I write a thread on building a Twitter account and mention learning how to write well, I can tag a big writing account and give them some praise.

If I write a thread on X and want to give the readers Y resources, I can tag someone that provides Y resources.

A lot of the time the accounts you tag will retweet the thread as a whole.

If you enjoyed this thread, let me know in the \#business-strategy channel.

If you have any questions, post them there as well\!

For bonus points and an RT, post your thoughts about it on Twitter and tag me.

# The Best Social Media Engagement Group Structure

Whether you are for or against the idea of engagement groups \- they are an extremely good way of:

Leveraging other's network of followers  
Making lifelong connections (Joey and I met in an engagement group, look at us now)  
Strategizing with those at a similar level as you, sharing new tactics you are learning  
Staying active on the timeline and building your tribe (people will start to associate you with those people, and it will build a stronger connection with your audience)

The general problem with engagement groups is that they aren't structured. People send posts at every second of the day... some don't send, and the group ends up dying out.

This is the strategy that I used from 5K to 50K ish followers. It's simple and doesn't require you to share a ton of posts and destroy your feed.

Below I've embedded a video explaining exactly how to structure the group using this excel sheet (click "File \> Make a copy" and then you can edit).

I would HIGHLY recommend posting in the \#business-strategy channel to form a mastermind group with other members of MMHQ. Or you can DM people individually here or on socials based on their follower count being relative to yours.

I hope this helps\! Happy social growth.

P.S. This works for any social media platform. Instead of retweeting, it is sharing. On Instagram it is a story share, on LinkedIn it is sharing the post, etc etc.

# The Best Growth Content For Social Media (and how to create it FAST)

As many of you know, I am a HUGE fan of emulation.

That is \- picking something that works on the funnel level and differentiating yourself on the brand level (mostly personal brands in our case).

Funnel \= content, copy, landing pages, free products, paid products, services, and how you get people to buy. There is somebody in your industry that has already figured it out \- steal from them.

Brand \= why they choose to buy from you. Usually based on authenticity or authority (see: Twitter Matrix).

We will be discussing the "growth" factor that fuels both of these. Your organic content \- free lead generation.

How To Generate Unlimited Viral Content Ideas

The secret: DO WHAT WORKS.

You probably already follow brands that are similar to you. They have done something right somewhere along the way. Your job is to find that content and recreate it under your brand.

Where do you find content ideas?

Most popular YouTube videos from creators in your niche  
Top ranking blog posts found through Google search  
The featured articles on Medium based on your interests  
Top tweets from creators in your niche  
You can type "from:thedankoe min\_faves:500" in the twitter search bar to find tweets of mine that have gotten over 500 likes. You can do this for any creator, just replace the handle after "from:"  
Pinterest, Instagram, TikTok \- I have not figured out how to find the best posts, but if they get high engagement you can take them

How do you use these content ideas?

The content you find will be tried and true (especially the YouTube videos, they work wonders for idea generation).

YouTube videos, podcasts, and articles can be turned into threads. You can also turn ideas from those videos into individual tweets.

The main thing you are looking for here is the headline or video title.

Your job is to take that big idea and turn it into content that falls under your brand.

A headline can be turned into:

Short form content (tweet, insta post, another headline)  
An idea for your own expansion on that idea

The content in a video can be turned into:

List style tweets / social posts (if the original content is structured / numbered)  
Individual tweets from a random "knowledge bomb"  
Threads that are already structured for you

YOU ARE NOT PLAGIARIZING. YOU ARE EMULATING WHAT WORKS. YOU NEED EXPERIENCE, SKILL, AND KNOWLEDGE IN THAT SPECIFIC AREA TO REWRITE IT AS YOUR OWN. I am assuming you all have this and will use this ethically.

This is what everyone does. We all just steal from each other and our buyers are determined by our branding \+ marketing \+ getting in front of their face with the right offer.

There is only so much you can talk about for a specific topic \- so why not talk about the ideas that work?

We all have our own unique biases that will make these unique. This is an art.

The Natural Evolution

The longer you are in the game (through more experience and iteration) the more you will gravitate towards deeper content that SCREAMS \*insert your brand here\*.

When you are just starting out \- you are somewhat forced to create basic content that is proven to work. Nobody knows who you are or what you are about \- you need time, repetition, and an audience for that.

Grow by creating content that is proven to work. Slowly introduce your authentic voice, and make sure to establish authority along the way.

# The Best Products / Services & Niches To Sell To On Twitter

My friends\! I wanted to write this up before I leave for my trip.

I know many of you are beginners in the online business space, so hopefully this will help clear some things up and give you a game plan.

If you haven't already, read this article, The $5K Fast Track, either before or after you read this. It will tell you what to do after you have sufficiently learned a skill stack.

The Best Niches To Sell To On Twitter

Personal brands in general  
Ecommerce stores  
Info product creators  
Coaches / consultants  
AUTHORS  
Agency owners  
Founders / executives  
Busy 9-5ers  
A group of people that have offers but don't understand how to get an sales / leads via Twitter  
The beginner market in any industry (health, wealth, relationships)  
Service businesses (usually a one-man show that has a personal brand)  
Big corporate brands (Wendy's, Gillette, etc)

Twitter is a different space than Instagram or Facebook. You must understand Twitter as a platform to see this.

There aren't pages, maps, etc that are helpful for finding local businesses. So, don't target local businesses, or any business that you would would have difficulty finding on Twitter.

The Best Products / Services To Sell To Those Niches

Sell what is already selling. Run it through the other marketing frameworks in this channel and it will sell better. You are simply taking a piece of the pie.

Services To Sell:

In order to sell these services effectively, you need to get on the phone with somebody in your target niche and understand their client acquisition process. You are going to "patch the holes" in that process and increase their revenue via more product sales or lead generation.

That is for marketing services (email, design, lead gen, etc), not coaching / consulting that falls under the health / relationships vertical. Some coaching can go after the "increase business revenue" angle though.

Twitter account management, growth, and ghostwriting  
To any of the niches above  
Instagram account management, growth, and content creation  
To Twitter creators / personal brands that struggle to be consistent with Instagram (you can take their Twitter content and repurpose it).  
Fitness coaching  
For executives, founders, busy 9-5ers, or any non-business owner that can afford high ticket coaching  
Performance coaching  
To the same niches as fitness coaching  
Email marketing (sequences and broadcasts)  
To eCommerce stores, agency owners, personal brands, coaches  
Funnel creation (for info products, coaching, or both)  
To info product creators and coaches / consultants  
Authors, to sell more books (and possibly consult them on creating a higher ticket offer)  
High ticket sales (being a high ticket closer)  
Anyone with a high ticket offer (coaching, consulting, marketing service) or a high ticket course  
Influencers, creators, freelancers, agency owners  
Content multiplication / repurposing (taking tweets, videos, blogs, or whatever their main form of content is and editing it to post across more platforms)  
Example: taking tweets and making Instagram posts  
Example: taking YouTube videos, writing a blog post out of it, clipping the video for Instagram and TikTok, and then editing the audio for a podcast  
Niches: Any personal brand that already has strong content on any platform

For all of these... run through the Solopreneur Foundations training, the $5K Fast Track, and Your Marketing Strategy in One Sentence (and the articles tagged inside that).

Your job is to quite literally copy somebody that has already figured it out and get good at branding / marketing yourself (check out Personal Brand Mastery w/ Eddy)

This comes heavily into play for products as well.

The Best Products To Sell

Wonder why everyone and their mom has a Twitter growth guide? Because they sell. Well.

So, our first product that sells well is Twitter related.

If you want to sell something Twitter-related and not get memed off the face of the earth, RUN IT THROUGH THE MARKETING POSTS IN HERE.

The Twitter Growth angle is okay \- but you know what would sell more?

The Twitter Lead Multiplier \- that helps creators and coaches build out a Twitter-specific funnel to landing more clients.

In reality it's just a funnel and understanding of how to leverage Twitter for traffic \- but it would be seen as a powerful and authoritative product that would get quality buyers into YOUR funnel.

It would also have much of the same information as a Twitter growth guide.

Selling Your Unique System

I encourage people to create a high ticket offer first (see services to sell from above).

You can start landing clients immediately with this.

Then, once you have results, you can literally just turn your process for getting results into an info product and have all of the marketing done. You already know it will sell.

Even if the system isn't "unique" per se \- that's where marketing comes in. Narrow your target audience and sell to an individual.

Products That Sell

Productivity systems  
Business systems (how you get sales / clients for a specific niche above)  
Make any process in ones life simpler (example: twitter content creation for personal brands \- this is another angle that is better than the traditional "twitter growth")  
Weight loss programs  
Body part specific muscle building programs  
Individual specific muscle building programs (body type)  
Teaching a specific skill (marketing or otherwise)  
ANYTHING \- you just have to be able to market it effectively (yes I'm serious). This takes experience and practice/iteration to understand fully

Pay close attention to what others are doing, especially the accounts you want to be like.

Sign up for their newsletters, buy their products, study their funnels, and see where you would be able to help them (or steal ideas from them).

I hope this article helped\!

# The Simplified Product Launch Guide

Product launches should not be taken lightly. They have the potential to make you a lot of money. There are 2 ways to go about this:

Simply not care and launch (has its benefits)  
Care a lot, prepare, and make a ton of money

The first is fine if you are a new creator with a few followers. It is a good thing to just say "fuck it" and launch your minimum viable product.

You can always turn the product into something else  
You can always use that product as promotional firepower elsewhere  
You can iterate on the product and launch a better version when you have more followers.

The second is clearly the best option \- but I recommend doing it with a minimum of 5,000 followers.

You will have connections that can affiliate and blow up your launch posts  
You can leverage their audiences and your own since they will be over 5,000  
You will ACTUALLY have an audience that you can nurture and season with content before you launch.

Let's dive into the actual phases of launch.

Pre-Requisites

Having gone through previous articles in the Marketing & Ideation channel and have the general marketing strategy for your product locked down.

The product does not have to be complete \- but you should have a general outline of the problem you are solving and how exactly you are solving that problem.

Seasoning & Pre-Hype

The great thing about a personal brand is that you can talk about whatever you want, but as we learned earlier \- when it comes to sales \- we need to get specific and authoritative.

1-2 weeks leading up to your launch you will be posting to start moving readers up the levels of customer awareness.

From unaware of their problem to aware of it and wanting to fix it. When you put your product in front of their phase everything will make sense, and they will buy if done right.

What Do You Post?

Answer the questions from your market research in the form of tweets and threads. Threads are the ultimate authority builder.   
If you can write 2-3 threads on the subject before you launch, that's amazing (these threads can be turned into emails, videos, articles, and multiple tweets.)  
You can turn sections from your product into threads fairly easily. Don't be afraid to give away too much value. Free value is forgotten and isn't acted on.  
Tell VS Show   
Tell people what to do rather than showing them.  
Tell example: Do market research, create a product, and sell it on Twitter  
Show example: Actually show them your market research process, how you create a product, and how you promote it on Twitter  
Have at least one tweet a day related to your product.  
Have an occasional post (2-3 times a week) letting them know that you will be launching a product that solves X problems for X audience.

Preparation For Massive Exposure

By now there should be at least 5-10 people that you can reach out to and let them know that you are preparing to launch a product. Offer to pay them for exposure if you want, but most of them will help out for free if they believe in you and your product.

If you do not have 5-10 people that can help bring you more exposure (and possibly affiliate for your launch) then you need to start now.

Assets You Should Prepare

Multiple launch emails hitting different levels of customer awareness  
Multiple affiliate launch emails to leverage their email lists  
Multiple promotional tweets (test them all and double down on the copy / angles that bring the most sales)  
Multiple affiliate launch tweets  
1-3 launch threads (take information from the product and turn it into a thread, remember: tell don't show)  
General communication with affiliates and others that are just helping support the launch. Consider putting them into a TG group together.

Take the time to plan this out to the best of your ability. Launches are where the most money is made and can build a LOT of authority for yourself when done organically.

This will be a point in your entrepreneurial career where you will gain many followers (because they are interested in what you are creating), and make a ton of cash.

Launch Phases

There are multiple launch phases \- all of them have the potential to make a lot of money. Let's run through them.

Use this Product Launch Map below to plan out your launch phases and keep things organized.

Product Launch Map (Duplicate to edit)

Presale

Presale is optional.

It is also a great way to make sure your product gets done.  
This is an example of the term I like to throw around, "tactical stress."

If you are procrastinating in creating your product and deciding on a launch date \- start a presale.

This will force you to set a launch date and stone and get your minimum viable product out before then.

This will also let you know what areas need improvement based on the sales you get.

(Presales won't get a ton of sales, but they can get quite a few.)

Crucial Presale Points

Start your price low   
Depending on your confidence in the launch, start at $17 \- $47  
This is heavily dependent on the actual offer and can go up to $497  
As you promote, continuously mention the launch date and that the price will increase (scarcity).  
Shamelessly promote more and more \- up to 2 times a day \- as you near launch date.

Launch Week

Launch week is simple.

PROMOTE. PROMOTE. PROMOTE.

Attack from all angles you can. Write different tweets handling different objections and use as much social proof as humanly possible.

Every time you put out a tweet, ask your network to engage with it. They don't have to RT, just ask them to like and reply to it for social proof reasons.

Promote 1-2 times a day for the entire week. Make sure everyone in your audience knows that you launched a product.

It is also crucial to remind affiliates to promote. Either have them in a Telegram group or DM them individually and ask them if they need anything for their promotions.

Leverage their audience as much as you can.

Post Launch

If you plan to have this as a core offer in your value ladder \- it doesn't stop there.

If this is a micro product that you don't really care about \- you can skip to the second part of this section where we talk about repurposing the information.

Extending The Lifetime of Your Product

After launch, your job is to get creative with promotions to keep sales coming in steadily.

Having guest appearances to teach a subject (to leverage their audience and broaden who your product targets)  
Adding on a bonus of your own or another product  
Offering to pay for products you affiliate for (this works well for memberships because you get MRR)  
Building out a follow-up product to sell to buyers.  
Slowly increase the price by $10-$20 at a time when it feels right. This is usually every month or so but allows you to keep scarcity high.

Repurposing Dead Products

Eventually your product will lose the hype, and that's okay, here's what you can do:

Launch another product, wait until it "dies" and then bundle them together for a cheaper price.  
Use the dead product as a bonus for a new one.  
Using them as incentives for video testimonials.  
Using them as a very cheap tripwire so you can get more "buyers" and put them into buyers email sequences (segmentation.

This article is crucial \- you should plan this launch out carefully and strategize with your network. If you have any questions about this leave it in the \#business-strategy channel.

# The Social Matrix For Authoritative Audience Growth

There are 3 crucial aspects of growing an audience:

Authority  
Growth (obviously)  
Authenticity

If one of these falls, you become a commodity. We do NOT want this. We want our account to be an asset.

You need balanced mixture of this content to make it work.

60% growth  
20% authenticity  
20% authority

If you tweet 5 times a day (recommended) you would have:

3 growth tweets  
1 authenticity tweet  
1 authority tweet

This creates leverage. What does this mean?

It means nobody can replace you. You become your own niche. Your expertise \+ unreplicable experiences \+ attention \= leverage.

You eliminate all competition and gain loyal followers (on Twitter that is).

Growth

There are many things that attribute to growth (authority and authenticity HELP), but you need content to be retweetable. How do you make content retweetable?

Tweet about topics that are already doing well  
Turn your personal experiences into relatable insights  
Simple advice based on your content pillars. Write at a 5th grade level.  
General health, wealth, and relationship advice.

The easiest way to understand what I'm saying is by understanding the format of viral blog posts. Tweets are just mini blog posts.

Headlines \= short tweets, list tweets (9 signs a person is really happy with their life), and you can turn each point into tweets.

Retweetable content leads to growth and intertwines with authority \- the more followers and engagement you get, the more people respect you. Weird, but true.

Growth tweets will get the most engagement. Don't get discouraged if the others don't get much engagement.

Authenticity

Authenticity shows people that you are a human. You display this by:

Tweeting about your losses and how you plan to overcome them (don't pity post, tell them what you are doing to be better).  
Giving advice contrary to what people are used to in your niche.  
Documentation: show people what you are doing in real life (photos and videos encouraged but optional)   
What are you working on? What does your lifestyle look like? What did you eat? What does your niche audience do that you also do?  
Post about your likes and interests.   
What kind of music do you listen to? How can you display your personality?

Tweet once a day for authenticity to help nurture the followers you gained with growth.

Authority

Authority tweets help prove your expertise \- these start warming people up for sales.

You can either tweet direct concepts from your current products or other actionable information to your target audience.

These should be very specific meaning you should call out who you are targeting, their pain points, and (optional) how to fix them.

Example: Entrepreneurs are good at making money, but at a sacrifice to their health. Your quality of work suffers and revenue is limited in growth. Health is wealth.  
Step by step posts to solving this pain point work as well (see: blog post style tweets)  
SOCIAL PROOF: This does not necessarily mean posting a screenshot of a review. This means telling a story of where they were before and what they accomplished working with you.   
Having a screenshot of a review will make it seem promotional and get less engagement.  
Telling a story will get a ton of engagement because it inspires people. They will be in the comments congratulating them.  
Then, all you have to do is plug a link or ask them to DM you.  
(Remember to mention your specific target audience here.)

Authority tweets are what will make you the most sales. Promote once a day \- whether its a free or paid product/service.
