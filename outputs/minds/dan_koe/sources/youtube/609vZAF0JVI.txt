alrighty my friends what is up welcome
back to another video i have had a lot
of people ask me what my favorite books
are right books are amazing i
get this question maybe like once a day
maybe even more books they've changed my
life i'm sure they've changed yours
that's why you're looking for more to
read of course so we'll hop straight
into it with my book recommendations and
now i want to i want you to keep in mind
that this
doesn't really have anything to do with
business
but they have helped my business in more
ways than one and the reason that is is
because of pattern recognition and
because business you're working with
other people so understanding other
people improving yourself gaining that
self-awareness is also a business hack
because you are gaining awareness of how
other people live you're diving a bit
into psychology whether you know it or
not et cetera et cetera and where i've
learned most of my business stuff is
through trial and error and specific
knowledge via courses so in terms of
business i recommend courses over books
unless you want a foundational
understanding of like influence
persuasion specific tactics whatever it
may be but in terms of self-improvement
or even spirituality philosophy
definitely recommend books so the very
first one
is the power of now those that know me
you know that i talk about the power of
now like
all the time and the reason behind that
is because
of how i came across this book when i
was
younger and just getting into fitness i
was watching matt ogus and all of them
in the like kind of golden era of
fitness youtube and he brought up the
book the power of now to me when he was
in a contest prep so he's very low body
weight uh his his hormones and emotions
are screwing with him so he resorted to
mindfulness and the power of now to help
with that and he talked about how it
really helped now
how i came across this book is first
year of college i was smoking weed in
the top of a parking garage on campus
long story short i ended up getting
arrested for smoking on campus and i
thought nothing would come of it and
when i went home for the summer to work
as a lifeguard
i got a letter in the mail from the
court
and it was like you can either go
through this 12-week program pay like 5
000
or you can go to court try to defend
your case and possibly be convicted of a
felony and so i'm like well this
isn't good at all uh i
went through a couple days of just like
worrying a lot being super stressed out
didn't show my parents it's like i i
can't afford five thousand dollars as a
college student working a part-time job
over the summer it just wasn't gonna
happen and so i picked up the book the
power of now read through it and kind of
all my worries just washed away now the
thing with this book is that you have to
be open-minded you have to be at a
specific
level of development right the in terms
of like the pre-trans fallacy you can't
be in the pre-rational stage or maybe
you can you can't be in the rational
stage if you're trying to absorb the
teachings of this book because it's just
not going to make sense to you it's
going to sound too boo you you haven't
had those spiritual experiences before
that direct experience to kind of open
your mind to this world and the
difference between animal and human
right so power of now highly recommend i
also recommend a new earth which is his
sequel after this it's eckhart tolle's
sequel so i also recommend that now the
next one is the way of the superior man
and this is by david data it's also a
spiritual book a lot of these are
philosophy spirituality which is pretty
much like non-scientific psychology in a
sense it's just the things that
one psychology either has discovered
scientifically or has yet to discover
and is just based on direct experience
so it's kind of a way to get more
information and try things out and
experience things directly for yourself
rather than relying on
science to give you this black and white
yes you should do this no you shouldn't
do this that's not how humans work in a
sense and now i'm not discounting
science at all but just saying and now
the way of the superior man what it is
is kind of like a spiritual guide to
masculinity what masculinity is supposed
to be rather than the toxic and the
ego would you call it the egoic the
egoically driven
toxic masculinity that masculinity that
you see nowadays this will help you
understand it on a much deeper sense and
kind of that masculine feminine balance
while
being able to like be in a healthy
relationship as a masculine man that's
one thing that he prefaces this book
with is that it won't really apply to
the people that have more of a feminine
essence right it applies to the people
that have that masculine masculine
essence and don't know how to harness it
for fulfilling relationships with that
masculine feminine dynamic now the next
one is the caballon and now i posted i
posted all of these on tick tock and you
can easily see like what developmental
stages people are in when they leave a
comment because they're saying like this
is some satanic you haven't read
the book you don't have that awareness
why are you saying that the kabulian is
hermetic philosophy and it's seven
principles that are broken down and it's
pretty much not i think it is how
reality functions right
you have to read it to understand it but
in essence it breaks down these seven
principles
of how life works from a very meta
foundational perspective and it'll help
you navigate the world and kind of zoom
out that's why i like reading philosophy
and spirituality is because it's big
picture thinking right it primes your
brain to zoom out and see the entire
picture rather than get hyper focused on
some technical detail that isn't going
to help you in any way at all it's like
a big picture strategy where then when
you come back in you you have that
feedback to know if you're moving in the
right direction now the next one is the
wisdom of insecurity by alan watts now
some people argue that alan watts all of
his stuff is discredited because he died
an alcoholic or something when that is
in line with his teachings
he doesn't say anything he's a he's a
bodhisattva right he's still human but
the thing i love about ellen watts is
that he serves as inspiration for my
writing and just the way i want to be
able to think right he's very poetic
what he says is art like his his writing
his speaking it's it's art and it has
taken a lot of practice and that's what
it is for me while the contents of the
book are absolutely amazing the the real
value that i pull from it is kind of
just being awestruck by how he wrote
that specific thing and that alone holds
value within itself it really does now
the next one this will be the last
spiritual one kind of
is
awareness by anthony demelo jk molina a
lot of you know him he turned me onto
this book
it's it's great it's an amazing
book it will help you navigate the world
in a better way i'm a more calm
uh collected and aware way and it talks
about gaining awareness of
almost everything being aware of your
thoughts your actions
other people how they react how you can
react to them and all of this other
stuff it's just a way to develop
your spiritual well-being and just the
way you navigate conversations in a
sense and become aware of certain things
so you can not only overcome them but
kind of dissolve these negative traits
and beliefs and mindsets
that you have adopted over time through
cultural conditioning now the next two
play into each other very very well the
first one is the art of impossibles that
by stephen koppler i don't have these
books anymore because they're on my
kindle so i can't show them to you but
the art of impossible is pretty much
talking about uh peak performance and
how to get into that peak flow state and
accomplish impossible things and from
what i've read i would assume that his
definition of impossible are
things that the average person would
think are impossible like oh working for
myself and starting an online business
and only working two hours a day that's
impossible now
you can't do that and yes you can it's
extremely possible and the thing behind
this and that really stuck out to me was
the five
drivers of flo i believe that's what it
was from him but it's it's curiosity
passion purpose autonomy and mastery and
all of these play into each other and
they also lead to each other so
curiosity something i talk about a lot
because it's important is the
first step and will lead to these other
things and it talks about how to
cultivate this passion based around your
interests your curiosities how to assign
a purpose to it how to gain autonomy or
that you need autonomy in order to
pursue these things fully and then
mastery is the step above that and then
the rest of it is talking about skill
acquisition creativity all of this other
stuff but the seventh book which is flow
by mihai chiksek mihai i probably
butchered that crazy ass name
but that
put all of the pieces together for me if
you read all of these books
in this succession you would make
incredible connections when you read
flow afterwards it's pretty much his
life's work
was dissecting the psychology of flow
the flow state and other ancient
teachers and spiritual gurus some called
it a degree of flow state the present
moment the now no mind all of this stuff
it's degree of this flow state and the
one main lesson that stuck out to me in
flow was the
concept of psychic entropy and the
concept of consciousness which is kind
of like a storage of your experiences in
your mind right because the human brain
or humans as a whole can process 126
bits of information per second
throughout their entire lifetime they
can process 185 billion units of
information or bits of information now
if you take this 185 billion bits and
and that's what you can process and part
of that is what is stored in your
consciousness as memory or direct
experience or the things you have
awareness of right i can bring back the
analogy of a map where
in a video game there's a map if you're
in this specific location you it's it's
bright on the map and you have awareness
of everything that's within it right and
then if you venture into the unknown or
the darkness and you shine the light of
awareness on that map then it opens up
but it also gets stored in your
consciousness right or in your head and
you can pull from that experience and
now this 185 billion bits of information
is
your potential as a human being right
the depth of information that you store
in this 185 billion bits is your
it
matches your potential or your
experience level in a game right because
if you're just going through the motions
of life and you're experiencing this
very
shallow and average existence and you
aren't making connections or diving
deeper into specific areas of life where
more connections are made that many
people haven't discovered before in
their life by doing and acting and
building businesses and uh like getting
fit in the gym
you
start to operate at a much higher level
and life becomes much more meaningful
and fulfilling and that is the main
topic and lesson
of the book so those are the seven books
i have many more that i could give so if
you like
this style of video and you want more
book recommendations let's try i don't
know what the average number of likes i
