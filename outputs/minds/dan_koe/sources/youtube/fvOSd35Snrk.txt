learning is the foundation of the human
experience but 99 of people do it wrong
and we are talking about true learning
here so for the purpose of this video
knowledge hoarding memorization and
traditional learning for the sake of
performance or getting good grades will
not be considered learning learning is a
byproduct of experience and The Human
Experience is composed of so much more
than we think it is or that most people
ever really expose themselves to right
The Human Experience is a range or a
spectrum of sounds lights feelings
senses as a whole that are kind of a
snapshot in time that over that time
they rise they fall it's kind of like
oscillation it's like a harmonic
oscillator and everything that we
are exposed to in our entire lifetime
form One Singular perspective it is a
spectrum of feeling sights sounds and
distinctions that form a singular
perspective that we as individuals have
it's like a snapshot in time a figment
of present moment Consciousness that
passed in less than a millisecond and so
words or the things that we think we
know the things that we memorize or the
way that we communicate we're not
getting across the whole picture because
reality is composed of symbols metaphors
and images that we have built on top of
before we add language have you ever
thought this deep into all of this where
did this all come from right where did
the buildings and and the government and
school and language and the way that we
communicate and the way that you're
perceiving what I'm saying on a screen
of pixels right now has all been built
from the essence of reality that we have
just built layers and layers and layers
so we can operate from a S we can share
a singular perspective and still most
people don't even do that they're so
that's where the difference comes into
play right when you get closed off to
learning it's because you fail to try
and understand someone else's
perspective right because it's just a
clash of two different ones that are
composed of everything that you've been
exposed to throughout your entire life
and so when someone with opposing
beliefs or views or just an entirely
different perspective
interacts with you and you're not
willing to see past the blur or uh see
what you aren't perceiving that's when
close-mindedness anger all of these
negative emotions happen because you
aren't able to be one with what is in
the very moment that you are in so that
was fun that was philosophical but where
does learning come into play right
struggle and failure now what does that
have to do with what we were talking
about earlier is that people
don't like struggle or failure right but
they are a part of reality they are one
of the lows right we talked about the
Spectrum we talked about we've talked
about in previous videos how life comes
at you in waves how a lot of this is
uncontrollable at least like external
reality right the way that we react to
it is controllable but reality itself
there's evil out there there's love
there's hate there's two sides of the
same coin there's there's struggle
there's failure there's Challenge and a
lot of the things that we shy away from
the things that are and always will be
there
that is where the best things happen
right and that's why so many people
don't get results is because they shy
away from the things that will get
results and so that's the other thing we
were talking about sharing perspectives
with someone else because everything is
perspective right that is true learning
is understanding multiple perspectives
throughout your entire lifetime if you
want to be a health expert then you need
to understand every perspective in terms
of nutrition of what is healthy for you
right you can't become ideological about
one like flexible dieting or vegan or
even ancestral or carnivore you have to
understand all of them if you do not
want to be triggered or offended or just
so close-minded to actually seeing the
truth
that's exactly how you learn that's how
you become a true expert and so you have
to understand that this is going to
imply failure this is going to imply
that you don't know
what you're talking about right and
nobody wants that nobody wants to fail
nobody wants to be seen as this person
that doesn't know much when nobody knows
anything and so the acceptance and kind
of embracement of failure is what's
going to lead you to learning those New
Perspectives that will that are going to
be the puzzle pieces to getting what you
want so since true learning demands
failure
treat this video as a seed of awareness
rather than me giving you advice right
I'm just making you aware right an
advice really means nothing unless
someone takes and applies it but even
then they're taking their own advice
because that's how we perceive the world
right you're listening to this and
you're interpreting it by kind of
deciphering it in your mind really fast
according to your own perspective right
so if I am giving you advice you are
giving a different kind of advice to
yourself by telling yourself that story
of what I'm saying and then when you go
and act it out you're listening to your
own advice so
take it that way right your happiness is
a byproduct of your inner game that is
your ability to understand interpret and
control your mind towards favorable
outcomes the first step to True learning
is changing your perception of failure
because if you have selective perception
if you're only seeing the bad parts of
failure then you're going to be scared
from it right you're not going to
actually try and fail and that leads to
a lack of learning and therefore a lack
of understanding and so
people have this pre-programmed hate for
failure because they don't understand it
people hate what they don't understand
right so if someone hasn't directly
experienced failure and realize that
it's not that [ __ ] bad it's not the
end of the world then
that's how you learn so why do we have
to fail struggle and embrace all of the
negative emotions that could come with
that in order to learn because when you
are in this bad State of Consciousness
or you're kind of lost right let's say
you're in this open Focus mode of
perception and all of these things are
held in your attention right you're not
laser focused on one task you're not
immersed in one goal you're open right
and that's either there's two sides of
the same coin there there's creativity
and there's anxiety or there's overwhelm
or there's laughter right when you see
all this stuff and it's just floating
out there and you have no way of
ordering it that is when your mind is
primed to receive the lesson that that
phase of life life is trying to teach
you that's when your subconscious mind
gives you that Insight right we've all
had that breakthrough or that aha moment
when we're struggling or we just don't
know what to do and we kind of give up
and we surrender and let go to what is
and then that that subconscious Insight
gets pushed to our conscious mind and
then we have the perfect solution and
we're ready to go or we learn the lesson
and it's like oh that's exactly what I
was looking for and then you start to
regain that mental Clarity so a bit more
esoteric is that you have to directly
experience the low
or the struggle or resistance in order
to bring the high into existence right
because one does not exist without the
other if you're down here ruminating in
uh the depths of your mind right and
you're in this whole negative emotional
downfall and you're just focused there
you're not open or willing to receive
the lesson that will bring the other
thing into existence and you have to
understand here is that people want
success success success but true success
it doesn't exist without failure like we
literally would have no idea what
success means without failure there so
unless you have directly experienced
failure you will not directly experience
success do you understand what I'm
trying to say here and so from my
studies and from what I've seen in
myself and others and just people that
are successful in general is that they
have to hit a certain threshold of
failures meaning that there is a set
amount of failures that they have to
experience before they can have some
form of success right so if you were to
put it in form in the form of a graph
it's like up failure up failure up
failure and then they learned enough
failures or they went through enough
failures or invested in their portfolio
of failures until they could afford to
succeed right I really like that
metaphor where you invest in your
portfolio of failures and then over time
you have enough money per se
metaphorically to succeed you have
enough lessons stacked up to where it
just makes sense to what
do in order to succeed because all of
those failures subsequently led to a
lesson learned and one lesson isn't
going to take you to success right it's
life we're talking about life here where
there's infinite amounts of just [ __ ]
everywhere and you think that one lesson
or one course or one blog or one YouTube
video or one of something is going to
teach you exactly what you need to learn
from your perspective that you are
operating from and you interpreting that
lesson without directly experiencing it
to achieve success it's just not going
to [ __ ] happen so I personally failed
at like seven businesses right I have a
video on this
um but it that's what I did I failed at
seven businesses and
people have asked like oh this is a
common question where it's like oh Dan
would you go back and change anything if
you could and I've thought about it and
I used to say yes I would go back and
change something but now I I couldn't go
back and change something it wouldn't be
a possibility right if I I always say
like copywriting was the thing that made
it click for me but that's only because
my mind was primed with so many other
failures to when I learned copywriting
it was just a perfect piece of the
puzzle and that everything shot up right
but if I were to go back and tell my
younger self oh learn copywriting first
then I'd just be one of these
copywriters that are out here still not
making any money because they haven't
gone through enough failures so if I
didn't fail at creating a design in
Photoshop then I wouldn't have started a
digital art page right and if I didn't
fail at creating that digital art page I
wouldn't have realized that I needed to
do something different because it wasn't
working in order for me to make money so
that's when I started freelancing with
web design or at least learning web
design and then that led to a bunch of
other failures to the point of then each
one changing this isn't shiny object
syndrome this is me realizing there's a
problem trying to solve the problem and
learning something new that would fix it
because with web design it's like okay
what's the next thing I should learn if
I want to make web design profitable
well SEO ties hand in hand with that so
I'm going to try that and then it's like
well now I'm missing branding I don't
know how to create a brand and then it's
like I don't understand advertising I
don't understand copywriting I don't
understand all this stuff and then fail
fail fail fulfill up until the point
where it's like I have all of these
complementary skills in my tool belt
that I can make anything work and I made
the first thing work and then given time
it's like I build another thing and I
build another thing and they all just
work it's like you increase your chances
of luck just by failing failing failing
and being unlucky right it's all it's
also counterintuitive if you want to be
lucky Embrace being unlucky if you want
to succeed Embrace failure it's all
Duality it's all polarity because they
are pairs they are the same thing they
do not exist without each other so if
you want this specific thing doesn't
have to be success just anything you
want you have to experience the opposite
side of that and for most people that is
going to be incredibly uncomfortable
until you just become used to it and
understand like it's normal it's a part
of reality why are we shying away from
it now
humans Find meaning in stories that's
what all this is right the universe unit
verse one song everything emulates like
everything points back to the high low
nature the the on off the back front the
heads tails the success failure there's
always two sides of the coin and when
those
two sides of the coin reach a specific
side so hero and velen are at the peak
of their battle right that's where we
find the most meaning that's when our
attention is immersed the most that's
when things get the most interesting and
that is not all of life that cannot be
all of life that is only a certain part
of the story right you may be in a
completely different chapter in your
life right now where you're just sitting
around doing nothing playing video games
all day doing whatever that's fine don't
label it because as soon as you start
ruminating and uh kind of like calling
yourself out for doing that that's a
good thing as well you can't really do
much about it I'm going to be completely
honest here you can't just have a string
of like intensity for your entire life
unless you're on some performance
enhancing drugs or some other things I
don't really give a [ __ ] if you do that
but whatever you have to understand that
you are in a different chapter than
someone else someone could be in Winter
of life and someone else could be in the
summer of life right someone could be in
chapter one someone can be in chapter 12
off someone can be at level one of the
game someone can be at level 100 and you
have to seek to understand that
difference because that's the
distinction you need to make in order to
learn effectively what you need to do
you need to make the distinction between
where you are and what you want and
what's causing the disconnect what's the
Gap and because that's the unfortunate
thing is our mind fills in the blanks to
these stories it fills in the Gap to
these stories right because when you are
listening to someone else you hear what
you want to hear and you there's just no
way around this right aside from being
mindful of it but when you see let's say
a tweet right a very polarizing tweet
that doesn't show the full picture of
the story in order for you to find
meaning of that and make sense of that
you are going to fill in what came
before and what came after where the
climax happened and all of this other
stuff based on your personal experience
and so that Gap that Gap that filling in
of the story is the main cause of all
these negative emotions and anxiety and
overwhelm it's guessing it's guessing
and let your mind or your ego fill in
the blanks of what is between you and
the desired outcome that you want right
and if it assumes failure and then it
automatically assumes a negative
connotation with failure based on your
past experience then you're just going
to be in a negative State when you could
go through you just have to go step by
step by step stepping stone stepping
stone stepping stone that is literally
the key to life that that's [ __ ] it
so another thing and trust me
more going into something we're going
into a good lesson here is that gains
life is a game Life contains an infinite
number of games and games are just
structured stories so it's like a fun
way games are a fun way of living out
something meaningful or playing
something meaningful right that's why we
like playing games when there's conflict
that isn't necessarily in our life but
we are simulating it via a video game we
get immersed in that and we enjoy that
and so you have to understand here that
there is a pattern or there is a lesson
that we can pull from that right there
is a lesson that we can pull from us
finding meaning and enjoyment in games
and stories when all a person's relevant
skills are needed to cope with the
challenges of a situation that person's
attention is completely absorbed by the
activity there is no excess psychic
energy left over to process any
information but what in any activity
offers
all the attention is concentrated on the
relevant stimuli so we can go back and
reference a previous video I did about
how singular focus is going to end a lot
of your worries rather than uh your mind
being split or your attention being
split between so many different things
and how important it is to immerse
yourself in the present moment or the
goal that you are pursuing or the
process for actualizing that goal but
you have to understand here right the
Gap is what creates the
um anxiety or the overwhelm or the
negative emotion so your skill and let's
let's just say like the level you are at
right now compared to the desired
outcome right so the known what you know
versus the unknown what you don't know
the gap between those things is going to
result in the degree of overwhelm or
negative emotion that you are
experiencing at this very moment because
you have no idea what's there and your
mind is trying to make sense of it so if
you don't know how to play a game you're
going to get anxious right have you ever
started playing a new game and you just
didn't know how to play and you're like
okay how do I do this how do I do this
right and you start to get anxious
especially if you have started playing
the game and you're playing against
someone that's like 10 levels higher
than you right because there's such a
gap so
when you're playing against that guy you
get anxious because there's no way of
winning right you get overwhelmed and so
when you are let's say level 10 at
playing the game so you're good at
playing the game but you're playing
against the level one or the Gap is like
in the opposite direction you're gonna
get bored right it's gonna you're not
gonna have fun so that Gap needs to
close and the known needs to get closer
to the unknown you need to live at your
Edge that means you need to embrace
challenge Embrace failure that you are
able to deal with and mindfully handle
the negative emotions that come and
understand that there is a gap in
understanding there in that you need to
close it and so that Gap in
understanding comes from learning and
failure but in a step-by-step fashion
right so if you are learning from a
business CEO and you haven't even
started a business why are you doing
that you're going to get anxious and
procrastinate because you're not just
focused on getting the business started
and then taking the actions step by step
by step by step and failing in
failing forward so the point being here
is that when you are living at the edge
of what you know you are consistently
challenging challenging yourself you're
embracing the slight discomfort that
isn't going to kill you and you are just
taking the small steps daily that you
have to in order to actualize whatever
vision for the future that you have that
is going to result in the most enjoyment
in your life right because the failure
isn't going to be so far away or it's
not going to be this huge gap in
understanding that's going to cause a
ton of anxiety and overwhelm this is a
huge part of getting into the Flow State
of Consciousness right flow where the
the skill matches the challenge or the
known is very close to the known you're
living at that edge of where the battle
or the conflict would take place and you
are kind of living out that aspect of a
story in a controlled fashion
in a way that your mind can make sense
of because the mind tends towards
disorder right if you do not
truly try to do this if you are not
intentional about doing this and being
intentionable intentional with the
actions you take on a daily basis
your mind is going to slowly become
disorder right you're gonna you're gonna
drop certain habits you're going to pick
up older habits that weren't as good for
you your nutrition is going to start to
go to crap you're going to stop
exercising and the world tends toward
disorder the universe tend towards this
order right tell me if you understand
the solar system on a level that you
have directly experienced and now let me
tell you or let me ask you if I told you
to go and hop from planet to planet over
the course of the next 10 years would
you be able to do that that's just too
disordered it's too disordered it's not
going to work so the key here is setting
a goal that is not so far away that you
get anxious but it's not so easy to
accomplish that you get bored right it's
to set a perfect goal with iteration and
testing and just trying things out and
basing your actions off of experience
that is what is going to make this
entire step-by-step Journey so enjoyable
and allow you to actually learn from
your failures because you're not gonna
be in this headspace or State of
Consciousness that is just going to
interpret everything is wrong a a
question before we come to an end
because a lot of people will
procrastinate on this or they'll just
listen to this and not do anything about
it right that's I feel like that's why a
lot of people watch this content I do it
sometimes too where you watch it
as an excuse to not take action right
like have I taught you anything except
for like maybe gave you some motivation
here I don't I would argue that like
nothing teaches you anything because we
talked about advice earlier the only way
you learn true learning like something
that you would be able to pull and just
talk about forever or wisdom for that
matter
is the result of failure and if you are
not failing on a daily basis or a
monthly basis or a yearly basis even
you're just not making the progress and
so let me ask you is your vision
valuable Enough To You Right your vision
for the future because think about it if
you are going to achieve your vision for
the future someday why are you not
building it out on a daily basis right
now why are you waiting a year from now
when at some point in time you're going
to have to be disciplined enough to work
on it every single day so when I ask you
is your vision valuable enough to you
have you sat down and internalized and
thought deeply about how that vision of
your future is going to spread into
every area of your life right whether it
be Financial Freedom uh like
an amazing physique that you want to
build or just like the girl of your
dreams or the man of your dreams
whatever it may be think about how that
could spread into your life right so
let's say the goal is Financial Freedom
as a part of your vision for the future
so is that worth 10 years of failure
think about that think about this is
Financial Freedom worth 10 years of
failure now think about this flip side
of the coin this is a great way of
thinking and actually helping yourself
achieve goals is to think of anti-vision
right so is Financial Freedom worth
10 years of failure and now ask me or
let me ask you
is 10 years of what you're doing right
now is 10 years of struggle
just worth it at all because that's the
other option right like if you aren't if
it's a if it's a decided thing in your
mind that your vision for the future is
going to be yours but you're not working
on it on a daily basis and you are
eventually going to have to you are just
putting off a less fulfilling version of
failure every single day of your life
and that is self-imposed that is your
fault so
you don't need any more advice why
because if fulfillment is found at the
edge of the known right the edge of your
comfort zone you already know it you
already know what to do you don't need
to study some eight billion dollar
founder to get their advice because you
already know and you this is how you
learn you push out to the edge of the
known maybe you get a little taste of
the unknown and then you just keep like
that's it but nobody wants that everyone
wants to jump this huge gap and that's
where the negative emotion happens and
that's why everyone's in this state is
because you just don't take these small
fulfilling actions every single day it's
so [ __ ] simple
that you just need to do it
