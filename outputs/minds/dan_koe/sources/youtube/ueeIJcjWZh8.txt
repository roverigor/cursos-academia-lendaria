What's up?
Yes, I got a haircut.
I'm not sure how I like it, but let me know what you think.
This is quite possibly the most popular topic
in these self-imposed movement space.
These types of posts like this one
get a lot of views and engagement,
and that's kind of why I'm making it.
But I want to bring a new perspective.
But the posts in question
are the ones like The Best Side
Hustles to start in 2023,
the best online business model in 2023.
How to get rich and Stop
being so Poor in 2023.
Please click now or you will have
ten years of bad luck.
I'm tired of the last one too, and all of these videos,
posts or articles lack.
One big thing in that is a big picture
overview of online business.
They focus more on the tactics
and the methods and the outreach,
special strategies, the flavor of the day outreach strategy
in order to gain more clients
or do whatever it may be to make more money.
Right now, as always, there's nothing wrong with this.
I have nothing.
I have nothing against this.
I watch it all the time, happen online.
I watch some of the videos myself,
but I am here to bring a new perspective
and potentially open some minds
to a new route that you can take.
And the problem here is that every single person on
this planet is wired to want that quick fix.
I did and I still do to this day.
I want the quick fix and I have to step back and remind myself
that that success doesn't come instantly.
And I've proven that to myself, right?
It helps when you have experience to bank on.
But the beginners,
they don't have that experience
and so they get trapped in this loop of quick fix, quick fix, quick
promise, latest best business model in 2023.
Let's make it happen.
And then you go through a cycle of failures like myself,
where you can
watch previous videos of mine where I talk about my story,
but you have to go through the failures.
There's no escaping it.
But maybe, just maybe, this video can help a beginner
start on the right path
because the quickest fix is the longest path,
or accepting the longest path rather
than jumping to one thing, then another, then another
just to come back
to the longest path and then make it work.
And so what I'm here to tell you is that the latest
and greatest strategies or tactics or business models
may not work.
And if they do, if they do work for you,
they probably won't be around in 3 to 6 months
because you're fighting other bottom feeders
that lack purpose behind their work.
And that is because these bottom feeders don't really like that term.
But that's what they are.
They are in a state of survival.
They have not mastered themselves.
They have not gone through the self-improvement or the mental work.
Benji just moved the camera
in order to break out of that state of wanting that quick fix.
So that's all they can see because their mind is so narrowed
on this desired end result
that the only that's the only thing they can think of.
They can't zoom out and see it on a ten year,
20 year, 30 year life's work perspective.
And so you can see this right now
in the short form, content agencies, the ones that are creating
like reels, tiktoks shorts for certain creators
or even on Twitter,
if you're in the Twitter space, the ghost writing,
that's a very popular agency model right now
and they're both very lucrative, don't get me wrong.
But you have to understand that I personally
this is why I'm like talking about this is I get a hundred
DMS and emails a week about
hiring someone to give me
the same Walmart quality captions on a real
that isn't going to help grow my brand.
Like the subject line is Hey, do you want more views?
Do you want more subscribers?
Let's blow up your account.
Let me create these captions and cap cut
and be the same as everyone else and expect it to work.
People don't care to get good.
They care to get money.
That's a brutal mistake that I made.
And you will too.
So treat this as a seed of awareness that you will register
as you were going through your mistakes and failures
on your business journey.
Because if you're chasing the quick bucks with the latest strategies,
you have about 3 to 6 months before you need to pivot.
Therefore, you need a big picture overview of business
or give up or prioritize becoming the best in that space.
If you're going to do the captions
or you're going to do the ghost writing, it better be a 5 to 10 year
long fucking game plan where you are the best in the business.
So what is the best
business model of 2023?
The best business model is an actual business model,
not a side hustle, not free online
surveys that pay you $0.05 for every survey you complete.
It's not investing your weekly allowance into crypto.
A business has to generate revenue.
You need cash flow.
A business has the ability to scale,
pivot and position itself
in the market regardless of algorithm
changes and trends and half of the short form
content marketing people will be out of a job in six months.
They will because they don't understand marketing.
They understand a little piece of marketing
which is short form content.
But do they understand long form?
Do they understand how short form fits into the funnel?
Like what's the quantifiable end result that you're giving with short
form content? Is it more views?
Because frankly, most people don't give a shit about views?
Is it cash?
Because then you're going to need a unique system
or templates or strategies for actually converting
short form content into leads or cash,
because short form content is usually very shallow
and that does not nurture a lead into
becoming a high paying customer or a loyal customer.
Right?
I'm not talking about direct response here.
Go and fill this out in the funnel that's already created, right?
Because short form content agencies do very well
when they target a creator or a brand
that already has a funnel that is converting leads.
But your short form content is just driving a tiny bit more traffic.
You're not the reason behind their success
and you need to understand the reason
so that you can eventually iterate
on your offer into order to make it something
that gets results for anyone you want.
Money is the lifeblood of society.
It is the fabric that holds society together right now.
And so on a micro scale, right?
So money being the lifeblood of society, blood,
when it stops flowing to your hand, it will die.
So if blood stops flowing to a certain space
in the online business arena, it will die off.
And so if your business that does not fuel
the market or provide blood to the market,
then your business will die off
and therefore your sense of purpose will die off.
Because that's the thing.
If you aren't making money, that means you aren't
contributing to society and that means that you aren't
you aren't contributing to something that is greater than yourself,
a.k.a. having a purpose.
So business is the modern vessel for living with purpose,
and business is a vessel for your value.
That is what it is.
Online surveys and prescriptive
business models that you find online.
And most jobs are soulless.
A business has an offer
and a traffic source, and this is a universal principle
beyond business and offer equals value
and traffic equals people, right?
So if you do not have an offer
and you are not putting it in front of people,
then you will not sell that offer.
Or if you have a lot of people like you've built an audience
but you do not have an offer, then you aren't going to make money.
The same is true with relationships.
If you are a valuable offer in this lens
and you put yourself in a group
of desirable people or the people that you want to meet,
because you can also go into a group of people
that you don't care about or don't care to form a relationship with.
You have to match those two, right?
Or if you go into, let's say,
a bar scene where there's a lot of people
but you are not a valuable offer,
then you are not going to sell or convert.
So let's talk about the dynamic traffic source, right?
Because we need traffic before we need an offer,
which we'll talk about soon.
But I'm not a fan of putting yourself in a box
and I am bullish on the future of the creator
economy, which we talked about in the previous video.
The future of the one person business
because the creator economy is the new economy.
Regardless of if you want to become a creator or
start a business, right.
It's the new economy.
That's where people are hiring from brands and employers
are finding the value that you post online and are hiring from that.
So the resume is becoming slowly outdated and the public resume
a.k.a your personal brand, regardless of
if it's a business or not, is how you are going to make money
in other areas than just business.
And so that's why I am of the belief and have the philosophy
that everyone should display their value online
or start some form of a personal brand
because it is the closest thing to a one size fits
all traffic source there is for business, right?
Even if you don't start for business reasons
and you gain, let's say 50,000 followers and you get a job
and you get all of these other opportunities
because that's where opportunities come from,
then you can start a business right away if you have that.
And the other thing is that a personal brand
cannot be replicated.
We I've talked about this so many times.
There's no competition, there's no saturation
if you actually built a personal brand.
So with a personal brand, you don't have to rely on ads.
You can talk about whatever you want if you sprinkle in content
related to your offer, see the previous
one person business playlist.
You don't have to rely on cold outreach for long.
You build an audience so you can do whatever you want.
Eventually, your business doesn't die.
When you stop doing the manual work,
you aren't cornered into a specific niche,
like how Zuby on Twitter and other social media platforms,
not only talks about politics
but makes music and sells fitness programs.
Most people just can't get out of the scarcity mindset
of needing to land clients,
so their content feels limited and boring.
And along the way you just meet incredible people
that you wouldn't find in real life, right?
You get connected
with the like minded people that resonate with your content.
And so I've been doing this for like three years
and I've had two great friends along the entire way,
and I actually went to go and see them
this past week in South Carolina.
In Tennessee, we hung out.
We had incredible conversations.
And you can tell in this video,
in the last video, my energy is just
up, right?
I'm ready to go. I'm carb the fuck up.
I've been eating
so many carbs like 500 grams a day, still not gaining weight.
I'm trying to lean back,
but here's a picture of us by the lake.
Justin, Joey or Justin C, Scott, Joey Justice
and your boy that used to have long hair rest in peace.
And frankly,
you just won't find those conversations in everyday life.
You have to be intentional and the digital world is a great way
to put your intentions out into the ether, as Justin Scott would say.
So the lesson here is that your personal brand
should be considered the foundational traffic source for your offers.
Right?
A lot of people are worried about selling a business
even when they haven't started.
It's against the point.
Stop worrying that late into the future.
But personal brand, I plan on doing this
or having mine for the rest of my life.
I don't plan on selling me right.
But when I have that foundational traffic source
like I do now, I have a good amount of followers.
Then I can build another business
and use my personal brand to fuel it
and as long as I'm not too closely tied with that, I've learned
I can eventually sell that business and make it successful
ten times faster than someone else could without a personal brand.
Because I have that loyalty, I've nurtured the audience
and the business that I built or the businesses that I build
are going to reflect the values that I have
in my personal brand, and it will be an extension.
Therefore,
previous customers and my following will be able to fuel that.
And I'll have a network that just can send
massive traffic to it and help me promote it without paying
like so much money for influencer marketing
like other brands are doing.
I can get it for practically free.
And so the other thing is that paid ads are another traffic source.
But if more people know your name and you're
running paid ads to your audience,
then the conversion rate goes through the roof.
And the same thing with cold outreach where if I'm DMing, my audience
or people have just seen me around the space
because I produce content,
then they're going to be ten times more likely to reply.
Or if I have 100,000 followers,
they're going to feel obligated to fucking reply to me.
I don't really like
to think of myself that way, but that's what happens, right?
I got it.
The the first thing that made this click for me is when
someone was like 50 k DM'd me when I barely had
any followers and started talking to me about their services
and I was just like,
Oh my God, I'm talking to this dude with 50,000 followers.
No way.
And I bought his services, right?
You're just more open
to the people that display and have authenticity and value
to provide online and you can pivot whenever you'd like
because your content shouldn't be,
at least under my philosophy and what I teach,
your content shouldn't be limited to a specific topic or a niche.
It is limited to value, and value is
ideas written
from the lens of a specific goal or problem.
Regardless of the topic.
Topics here just help with idea generation.
Like if you write about self-improvement,
business and spirituality,
those are great, but you're only using
those to find content in order to generate ideas.
In essence, nobody cares about the topic.
They care about how anything and everything will benefit their life.
We are selfish creatures, so let's talk
about the experience model.
In essence, you help people that are at point A where you were before
and helped them get to where you are now with point B
and you have content and products
in between that with knowledge, experience and systems.
And that's how you make money.
And I've talked about personal branding
and content strategies in the past.
So we're leaving the traffic source of this video
at that.
You can go and watch my other videos. Instead.
I want to focus on offer creation, right?
A product or service because most people think
that they need the perfect customer avatar,
the perfect system, curriculum or coaching structure,
a fancy physical product with perfected
supply chain management, prior results.
When you need to actually work with someone to get results.
In reality, this is a harsh truth for many to accept
because there are also many negative connotations
that come up with it.
If negative connotations don't come up, then you're in a great spot.
In reality, you need to know
more than someone that is one
step behind you and you can see the terms.
The age of information, the attention
economy knowledge is how you catch attention.
Like in a sense, knowledge is how you communicate information.
Information is how you capture attention.
So in this modern business
landscape, knowledge is king.
I sound like fucking Tai Lopez.
I don't want to sound like Ty Lopez knowledge.
And so another thing is that everything in this world
goes through developmental stages.
We talked about in the last video
how your community that you attract evolves.
They set new goals, you evolve, you set new goals.
You are not static.
You stick to one niche.
You're fucked in my eyes.
You're not really,
but your purpose, your sense of fulfillment from your work is fucked.
And so business is no different as a whole where it comes in stages.
Beginner, intermediate, advanced.
So you trying to make $100,000?
Are you trying to make $1,000,000 from the start
is just going to cause overwhelm.
You need to break down that goal into manageable chunks
and focus on the levers that you have to move as a beginner,
which are going to be different at the intermediate stage
and different again at the advanced stage.
So be mindful of who you are learning from and what lens
they're teaching from.
I'm trying to teach from a beginner level here, but other people,
they could be teaching from an advanced level
and it's just going to cause anxiety, overwhelm
and the lack of results because you're focusing on the wrong things.
So we have to start small
and that's why I like to help people at the start create
what I call a minimum
viable offer, which is like a minimum viable product
offer is kind of more encompassing of both products and services.
I like to start with a service, and in this case
that service revolves around a single,
single skill or interest.
Don't go learning 8 billion Learn one
because charging the big bucks takes
time, experience and multidisciplinary skill acquisition
while building in the real world,
not reading about working with customers
but actually working with them.
So with that skill or interest that you learn,
you immediately turn it into a freelancing,
coaching, consulting, or what I call a tutoring offer.
And when I say skill, I mean anything like
email marketing, web design,
copywriting, Facebook ads, brand design, or anything else
from the $1 million skill stack video that we had in the past.
And by interest, I mean anything like health
and fitness, performance and productivity,
personal development and spirituality, relationships or dating.
And those are skills.
Yes, but I just want to make the distinction
between skill and interest so we can
understand how they apply to
the offers that I listed out.
And so first is just
we have to package up your offer fast and with a skill.
It should be fairly obvious, right?
It's a freelancing service.
So if you learn web design, then it's website or landing page design.
If you learn email marketing, then you're going to write emails
or you're going to set up email sequences,
you're going to you're going to do what you've learned.
And usually one hack here that people don't like register
is that courses, courses that you take
are usually they're higher ticket service, right?
Or they can be spun into a service like a Twitter course
as an example, like one that you get from Modern Mastery.
From my community, there's like three Twitter courses.
You can take those
and then you apply them to someone else's business
as well as your own or other than your own.
And that is a ghostwriting service, right?
So if you learn website design,
then you're just doing that for other people's businesses
and you don't have to take a course to do this,
but you will have to string together like specific YouTube videos
in order to actually build something
and then be able to do that for someone else.
And so anyone can pick up a skill fast,
start talking about what they learn, start teaching what they learn.
Then.
I've talked about this in the past as well, just to start teaching,
I don't want to go over all the limiting beliefs you hold again.
You're not an imposter, just fucking teach what you know.
But with that, that's how you attract clients.
If you understand how to write content fairly well
and then you pitch your offer, right,
Which is for another video and I've talked about it before again.
And so another thing, just a quick plug is that I've written
or I've created ten plus courses,
180 plus strategies inside of Modern Mastery.
It's five bucks to join.
There's also two are a writer, which is like my writing frameworks
for building an audience and then digital economics,
which is a masterclass of everything you'll need to know for actually
building this product izing yourself, building the personal brand,
solving your own problems, and marketing
a good product in a way that pulls in a creative
income in a non ideological manner,
as in, it's not limited to agencies or freelancing or coaching
or whatever.
It's very principles based.
So that was freelancing with a skill.
Now for coaching, consulting or tutoring offers,
we have to first understand this universal principle goal, right?
We start with a goal where your customer wants to be
or where you what you have achieved path your unique way
of getting them, their problem, what they are struggling with now.
So where you were or where they are
and how are you going to help them bridge that gap and then that.
So that's all that marketing is.
You're selling a transformation
that either you have achieved yourself,
you have helped others achieve, or
you want to start helping others achieve.
And remember that freelancers
gain experience by working with clients first, right?
They don't like.
You have to work with people in order to get that momentum rolling.
And so, like they don't even have results with the skill.
And when they start selling, you don't need results to start, right?
I can go and I can look up a planner on Amazon
and I can take it and I can create my own and I can put it on Amazon
and start making money.
Now, of course the marketing, the sales, etc.
those are details that come after and driving traffic to it
with something like a personal brand, but that's how you make money.
And so coaching and consulting offers are fairly obvious, right?
You help them with something like health,
productivity or performance in their life
and you walk them through it.
So this structure that we go over, we're going to go over a structure
for a tutoring offer
because I feel like more people can benefit from that.
But the same structure is applied, right?
Consider it the same structure as a coaching or consulting offer.
And so for a tutoring offer, I prefer this over
freelancing because you don't have to do the work for them, right?
It's more fulfilling.
You can take on more clients, you can scale a tiny bit faster,
but in essence you are teaching them the skill, right?
So freelancing offer was mainly skill based, so as a tutoring offer.
So this is less about personal development.
This is more about you acquiring a skill through your self-education
and then going on to teach it to others
and think of it like you're walking them through a course one on one.
So you're teaching them how to write an email newsletter.
You're teaching them how to edit a YouTube videos.
You're teaching them how to write social media content,
or you're teaching them web or graphic design,
because with this you can target a more beginner level, right?
So you open the amount of people that can actually use your service
because most people like what the short form content agencies
they're going
in, they're trying to target these people and flooding the market
when in essence they could just go and teach a creator
because their creator economy is booming.
They can go and teach a creator for four calls
how to actually go and create those.
Right.
But you have to be somewhat good.
I wouldn't recommend
doing this with Walmart quality cap cut captions.
And so with this as well is that the results from this transfer
over into a course or digital product much easier, right?
So you're able to flesh out an offer stack much, much, much quicker
because you teach someone, you get them results,
you actually have something to show for it
because hopefully you're having them create a project
and you can show, Hey, my students have created these projects
and then you turn your entire curriculum or your coaching offer
or tutoring offer into a course
and now you sell the course.
So you open up more room for more people
to afford your actual products.
And then from those products, buyers buy again principle.
In business, they will sign on with you
to actually walk them through it
one on one to learn and hold them accountable.
So you're increasing your income that way as well, faster.
And so the reason you're doing the tutoring offer instead of a course
first is because you can charge more and increase prices
to like 20 $500 plus after a few clients.
Of course, this is variable and it's a progression.
You don't have an audience
or traffic to bring in consistent core sales, yet
you don't know what gets results yet.
Even if you think you do, you don't.
You have to work with people and that's why you work
one on one and refine along the way.
And you can use direct outreach methods
or different strategies to acquire clients.
You weren't banking on the audience.
Instead you were doing more manual work up front
because that's a beginner strategy that you have to do
before you get to intermediate or advanced.
And then as your audience grows alongside you,
then you can wean off of that.
And so in short, it's easier to make a $1,000 sale than it is.
It's easier to make $1,000 sale than it is 100 sales, right?
You have more control over your income.
And then once you do that and once you realize that,
it's incredibly liberating.
And so coaching,
consulting or tutoring offers consist of a few things.
So the first thing, it's a structure
for what you are going to teach them.
And this revolves around
point a endpoint be the problem and the goal right?
And then how you fill that, right?
What are the steps in order to reach that goal?
So take out a notebook and actually write this down.
What is the promise? Right?
Are you going to help them create one fully edited YouTube video
as the tutoring offer?
And then the problem is that they don't have a skill.
They aren't able to break into the online
space, even though that's where the world is moving, right?
Marketing.
And then from there, how would you teach them, right?
What do they need to know?
What did you learn?
Is that the overview of like an editing software
and then how to actually cut things and structure the video.
And then after that, it's like color grading and B-roll.
Then after that it's exporting and uploading to YouTube, right?
So that's four calls, boom.
And so the second thing you need is weekly calls.
This is just like a general structure of most offers,
but weekly calls in order to walk them
through that structure or curriculum or outline.
And so I recommend selling or starting with
because you just need a place to start and improve
from is four calls, right once a week.
And so you want to start with four calls instead of one,
because that allows you to charge more.
And so your efforts go a longer way, right?
You don't want to charge like 100, 200 for a consulting call
when you could charge 1000 at the start
for a pack of four calls and then increase more.
And then you have to take on less.
Clients do less work, and you're able to focus your efforts more on
actually building leverage for your audience
so you can wean off of that.
And so what you do on
these calls is you just walk them through the structure.
You teach them exactly what you need to know.
Think of it as a live tutorial, and then towards the end you answer
any questions they have,
what they're struggling with and things like that.
So the third thing that I recommend is weekly
action items and text access.
So at the end of every call or at the end of every week,
you can write this down in your notebook as well,
is to give them action steps.
What do they need to do? Right?
So I recommend like having a desired end result
for the offer as a whole.
So if it's YouTube editing, it's having a polished YouTube video.
So every week, what do they need to do?
What do they need to deliver to you?
Right?
And then the text access with like telegram,
WhatsApp, or just giving them text on your phone
or a discord channel private to them or something.
And then you, they can ask you questions
whenever you want, get feedback and all of that fun stuff.
And so another example just to paint this picture,
because if you are selling something like graphic design tutoring,
what's the desired outcome?
Is it like creating one polish
social media post or an Instagram carousel?
That's the project, right?
Or if you're teaching coding
like a small coding bootcamp, what's the outcome?
Is it a final HTML and CC web page?
Right, Things like that.
And so in in terms of charging, right,
that's always people's question.
What price do I charge whether to just slap a price on it
and test it out again, quick fix mindset is going to fuck you up
where you could slap 5000 on it, try it out,
try saying 5000 when you're talking to people and see what happens.
And then after that they're going to say,
No, you're going to get a bunch of no's
and then you learn through trial and error
and then you refine your process to the point of actually selling
in accordance with the value you have to provide.
But I would recommend starting at like lower rate
so you can increase because it's harder to decrease.
So start at like 500
to 1000 for a pack of four calls.
And then as you get results, as
you get more confident, increase the price from there.
And so even better at the start,
I would recommend
helping people for free in the creator economy, specifically
because you're building online, you're networking with other people
that are distributing value online.
And so in this case, I want to paint the picture this way
where I worked with Joey.
This is how Joey and I met.
We actually worked with each other
and helped each other on a free call.
And Joey has a testimonial for me.
I have a testimonial from him.
At that time I had like 500 followers.
Now I have upwards of like 2 million, right?
My testimonial from him
is so much more fucking authoritative than it was before.
It's worth tens of thousands of dollars more
because people will see that testimonial from me.
They know who I am, they trust me
and they will buy like immediately without reading anything else.
So testimonials from creators are appreciating assets.
So you don't only want to try to land big fish
and try to make the most money without it's a progression
stepping stone, stepping stone, stepping stone.
And so the next thing is
you can either scale your client business
or you can productize, right?
So there's this is the difference between like an employee business,
like a regular business or a one person business.
So a lot of the people that I'm networking with right now,
they're focused on scaling a coaching offer
because it's very it's lucrative, right?
It's high. Take it coaching
They can
every a lot of people make a lot of money doing that
clearly and that's what they're doing.
And so they're hiring people as coaches, training them
and automating the process
so they can keep scaling that onward and onward.
But my preferred method, at least in this information
space, is to productize, right?
So it's turning it's one growing large
by talking about broad beginner level topics and really
whatever you want without niching yourself down too much
and then selling the tutoring, coaching consulting offer
and then packaging that up into a course or multiple courses.
And then that's how you scale is through low ticket.
And a lot of people don't like that, but
a lot of people don't have my results.
Sorry, not sorry.
So there was 1 million somewhere in this YouTube title.
And that's the thing is that you scale to 1 million with this.
It's either high ticket, a coaching consulting,
sometimes agency work.
I don't like the agency model but it's a good
it works or through low ticket product
and that's how you get there right You just it's it's a process.
It takes time and you build this leverage
over time in form of an audience
or a personal brand traffic source that compounds with time.
And eventually one day you run a promotion,
you make your first 100 or 200 K a month and you're like, okay,
I could probably hit this number and then you hit it.
It's that simple.
I mean, it's difficult, but it's that simple.
And so this took me I had a bit of prior experience with freelancing,
but I started creating
Creator Journey personal brand around three years ago.
Right?
And so that's what led me to now.
And I've made a bit more than that now,
but that's like timeline three years.
If you do it optimally
and you approach it from a space of experience,
then give yourself three years to hit like big numbers.
That doesn't mean you can't make a good amount
your first year, right?
Like $1,000,000 is a lot of money.
You don't need that much.
And so give yourself five years, give yourself
five years to make $1,000,000 in this space.
And I bet you can if you commit to it.
And so with that, that's the end of the video.
