we live in a delusion that we want to
make progress without it being hard so
we become slaves to what should be and
our should be is easy an example is that
people will go insane at the thought of
going on a walk outside when it's too
hot but then they will go into a sauna
without complaint and the difference
here is expectation and intention now of
course I'm saying like these two things
are different I'm just saying that you
can go into you can go and walk in hot
weather without complaining and causing
unnecessary pain for yourself and the
same thing is when you go out into the
cold your automatic reaction is to fight
and shiver and complain about it being
cold and it makes sense right because
the cold is uncomfortable so we focus on
the compulsive negative thoughts that
flood our brain and we get stuck in this
Loop of thinking but if you were to
change your expectations to actually
align with what reality is and what is
happening in the situation that you are
in and be with it flow with it you would
then start to realize that discomfort is
a part of the human experience and you
would also find that the interpretation
of your thoughts is the culprit of your
suffering I've learned this lesson many
times in my life the first that sticks
out in my head is the time where I got
arrested for the possession of marijuana
in a college parking garage and they
don't take that lightly on campus the
second was after I'd borrowed two
thousand dollars from my dad maxed out
my first credit card and took out loans
to fund my fifth year of college while I
was trying to make uh multiple
businesses work but primarily an
e-commerce business work at the time and
it failed miserably the third was in
Costa Rica after I just hit a new
monthly high in business I was very
excited and I had a girlfriend at the
time Brand New Girlfriend as well and I
thought it would be a wise idea hey
let's fly off to Costa Rica let's stay
there for two weeks and just have a
great time because I was writing the
money high and made an impulsive
decision and we ended up breaking up the
first day we got there and flew back the
next day and while it was cool Costa
Rica is a very nice place I hope to go
back one day but even after something as
bad or as what is seemingly stupid like
what a stupid decision that was but I
only realized that
um after I made that mistake and exposed
myself to that experience and learned a
very valuable lesson that someone else
couldn't teach me someone else could
tell me oh don't do that all day long
but unless I go and do it myself and
learn the actual lesson that's the only
way I'm going to internalize it so all
of these experiences had one thing in
common and that is mental turmoil not
just a slight increase in stress but a
huge increase in stress to the point of
where your attention Narrows and you
feel trapped the smallest tasks turn
into a mountain of impossibility every
thought becomes an enemy that is trying
to keep you trapped in this mental game
and there ceases to be a light at the
end of the tunnel and you can't help but
wonder if you'll ever get out and these
phases of Life aren't fun clearly but
these moments in life are the ones that
offer a lesson that can only be received
with a shift in Direction so all of
these major struggles had a few things
in common the first is that all
progress-induced happiness was stripped
from me like an Abrupt transition to a
new movie scene after the climax I felt
lost had little desire to sustain the
progress of my previous purpose I'd
achieved it and had to move forward I
experimented both Inward and outward I
tried techniques for inner peace while
creating new goals with accompanying
education and practice with time the
pieces of the puzzle came together
brought Clarity and launched me into a
new season of intensity and that is what
we are here to unpack now why does this
matter it's so you can identify the
point in life that you were at you can
break out of this thought bubble you can
zoom out see where you're at in the
story of your life see the light at the
end of the tunnel and avoid treading
water for too long before you're too
tired to get to shore there are two
types of Happiness one is derived from
achieving goals the second is derived
from achieving nothing but this balance
of peace and progress has to be upheld
by a sense of mastery
otherwise it becomes a shallow Pursuit
that will leave you disappointed
happiness is a skill it is not given but
it is created and as with all skills it
must be refined practiced and adopted as
a part of your life and when isolated
when we try to isolate and sustain and
make sense of this thing called
Happiness it ceases to make sense
because it can't make sense without an
unhappy reference point right I wouldn't
be able to set a goal for the future
without having a previous experience
like breaking up with my girlfriend in
Costa Rica and wasting a lot of money
and having to fly back and so this
illustrates the problem with the new age
positivity movement you can think
positive thoughts all day long but what
people fail to realize is that every
positive thought holds a negative seed
and this is why almost every great
success comes after great failure so
there are two states of mind to become
aware of being and doing on a similar
note or in from another perspective that
is peace and progress or Stillness and
movement and so when your attention is
focused on either of these modalities of
Pure Living you tap into the present
moment so pure peace or pure progress
where your attention is fully engaged in
either the task at hand or no task at
hand everyone wants money muscles and a
desirable partner the act of achieving
those goals feels incredible at the
start if you don't have a philosophy or
sense of Mastery behind your material
Pursuits you're in for a rude awakening
even if your actions don't change the
why behind them can a bodybuilder that
got started after a tough breakup can
shift his Focus to find meaning in the
microcosm of life that training is if
they allow their mind to see beyond the
identification with the material world
now those that do often acquire their
material desires change on the outside
but not on the inside many people turn
physical 60 years old while still having
the mind of a 12 year old going through
an emotional puberty the main Buddhist
teaching is that of impermanence that is
nothing can be isolated and held static
by the mind this includes ideas feelings
emotions people locations and everything
else that we try to latch onto and
expect to say the same forever the
identification with ideology dogma and
other static mental constructs is the
source of our suffering when those
things are threatened or attachment to
them is threatened like the string is
plucked then we are physically
threatened now thinking is not bad right
because you have to think about these
things in order
to be able to attach to them but
thinking is not bad especially when it
is critical but when gone unchecked
compulsive thoughts can create a
personal reality of inescapable turmoil
when one is still their mind wants to
move when one is moving their mind wants
to be still without deliberate practice
the mind will try to latch on to the
past or the future in an attempt to make
the impermanent permanent this is the
cause of unhappiness but it is not to be
demonized because that is against the
point when you feel unhappy observe that
feeling lean into it let it point a
finger at the moon and present the
lesson that life is trying to teach you
from that low lean into the coming high
now the activities that launch you into
these Blissful states of mind either
being or doing or personal you must
observe hypothesize experiment fail
learn and repeat this never-ending
process that is even once you've reached
some form of objective success because
even that isn't permanent if you aren't
tired when you go to bed and excited
when you wake up you need intensity and
goals the secret is to engage the mind
with the impermanence of life and flow
with it rather than the mind trying to
fit the impermanence of life into some
form of permanent structure now there
are seasons of intensity that most of us
have experienced and that's what we're
talking about here we're talking about
the cyclical seasons of intensity and
experimentation and so when we
experience these Seasons it usually goes
along the lines of the universe aligns
everything clicks and you act on an idea
that makes perfect sense you have
Clarity on your goals reaching new
levels of skill and enjoying the process
you feel a sense of purpose and it seems
like there isn't enough time in the day
but you wouldn't change it for a thing
the feeling of pure progress is
unmatched no distractions absolute
Clarity placing one two three bricks
down to build your vision for the future
now it would make sense to fill our days
with activities that we can sustain this
feeling with right and when we aren't
able to do those activities then we
resort to peace right so we balance the
peace and progress that's what we're
here to talk about and the seasons of
intensity aren't really the problem here
we're not we're not worried about those
because those happen after a season of
feeling lost and that is exactly the
problem here is those seasons of feeling
lost because people don't perceive that
situation as an opportunity and during
these times of feeling lost where you
don't really have a purpose to work
towards you don't have progress to be
made you're just in this grind of trying
to gather pieces and preparing yourself
for that next season of intensity and so
this is where your mind opens itself up
to the potential of mental turmoil the
things we talked about earlier when
either a massive shift happens or you
just gradually decline after a season of
progress into this low point where you
have the possibility to get stuck in a
rut and so if you can master your mind
in these periods of struggle then the
negativity ceases to be so negative and
you can engage your attention in the
right things that will lead to not only
a better feeling during these times and
more sense of control over your life
during these times but it it expedites
the process to reaching another stage or
season of intensity so during these
seasons of feeling lost or really at any
time
self-experimentation is the only way to
solve your problems for good people can
diagnose and prescribe a solution to
your problems but that's usually a
guessing game of back and forth of
trying to align goals and figure out
what the best solution for you is but
even a prescribed solution can be given
to anyone it's not Taylor fit to your
situation meaning that it isn't going to
be sustainable and that you're going to
have to find a new anyway so it's better
to just self-experiment from the start
so let's imagine that you're feeling low
energy right you're you're not in the
season of progress where everything is
going well you're in this season of
feeling lost and in a season of struggle
we'll call it where you're feeling low
energy and that is a problem that you
want to solve so since you're
experiencing this problem you're
subconsciously in search for a solution
and so when someone pops up onto your
timeline with confidence and conviction
saying something like the vegan diet is
going to solve all of these specific
problems that you have because that's
what marketers do and there's not a
problem with this of course but you have
to think critically as to what applies
to your situation and you have to view
it holistically and not just latch on to
this diet ideology that someone is
promoting and so what a lot of people do
and what I've done in the past not
specifically with veganism but you're
you're feeling low energy you decide to
try out the diet and from this
unenlightened state you clean up your
diet you follow their advice as a if it
were law and you see the results that
they mentioned or promised and then most
people attached to that diet ideology
and become a prophet of it and you
attribute the results that you
experienced to that specific method and
a lot of people latch onto it as if
veganism is the only option and they
will defend that ideology or that
identity that they formed like their
life depended on it because that's how
it feels for them since their identity
is threatened in reality what happened
is independent of veganism in this case
you ate more nutrient-dense Foods your
actions work to survive your vegan
identity you had Clarity not chaos by
following a disciplined nutrition
regimen people often write off like how
much Clarity really helps when you
experiment with a solution or you try
something new and you have the clarity
in your day because you have this
step-by-step thing to follow that's what
makes you feel good beyond all measure
yeah if you clean up your diet you're
going to have a bit more energy but most
of it is psychic energy being freed up
so you actually have the space and open
focus and you're not so narrowed in and
stressed on solving the problem but now
if you were not too attached to this
diet ideology and you were to try
veganism for a month carnivore for
another month flexible dieting for
another month keto for another month you
would make connections between the diets
to reveal the fundamentals of Health
pattern recognition equals dopamine it
would feel good doing this you'd pick
and choose certain methodologies that
you enjoy meaning they will bring
sustainable results next you'd refine A
system that fits your individual nature
to Perfection you see what you're doing
here you're adopting these different
perspectives and seeing them for what
they are which are impermanent and good
guidelines and then you would test them
out and pull the things that work best
for you okay so that was the purpose of
self-experimentation and the importance
of self-experimentation but what we need
to do now is separate two again right so
there's being and becoming or being and
doing or peace and progress right and so
what we need to do is both in these
periods of feeling lost we need to
experiment Inward and we need to
experiment outward so we'll start with
inward or experimenting for the sake of
peace and this is important during these
times of feeling lost so you can
actually gain perspective and then be
able to experiment outward without just
worrying that the world is going to end
so you feel lost because you don't have
a system to maintain a baseline level of
clarity in your life and when you enter
a new chapter of life that is when the
page turns or the movie scene cuts to a
sad point in life Claire dirty creation
should be a top priority that alone will
order Consciousness to the point of you
gaining a sense of control over your
future and to go inward the main
techniques that you're going to be
experimenting with are immaterial
philosophy spirituality or emotional
intelligence techniques the techniques
you can experiment with include but are
not limited to reading meditation
observation self-inquiry contemplation
long walks these activities engage your
attention with the present moment and as
with all skills you improve with
Progressive overload like you would
weights in a gym and that is by
gradually increasing the level of
challenge as your skill increases so
that you don't get anxious or bored if
the challenge is too high then you get
anxious and you're not going to do it if
the challenge is too low then you get
bored and you're not going to do it it's
like with meditation you don't start
with an hour-long meditation right you
start with five minutes you go to 10
minutes you go to 20 minutes because if
you sit there for an hour it may be
beneficial but you're not going to want
to do it the next day you're not working
the system into your day you're not
making it habitual that way and the goal
with inward experimentation is to
incorporate either one of these
techniques that work best for you or
create your own way of doing things that
allows you to sustain this inner peace
throughout your day right this has to
become a part of your life you need
something every single day to help with
your mental health and Clarity and so
mine I walk like 20 000 steps a day
sometimes less sometimes more but that's
what I do I go on walks all the time if
I'm bored go on walk if I'm not bored go
on a walk if I have nothing to do go on
a walk if I need to take a business call
if I need to write an article go on a
walk pull out my phone I literally write
my newsletters on my phone so now from
this place of inner peace and of course
you can probably assume that this is an
instant and this is going to take time
we're forming a foundation here for life
but the next thing is to experiment
outward from this place of Peace So the
second reason that you feel lost is that
you lost connection with a purpose goal
or routine that brought order to your
life right so if you let's say uh
flipped the chapter into a new phase of
life and you moved location and now
you're completely out of routine right
you don't have the mental system of okay
I'm gonna walk to the cost shop in the
morning I'm going to take this exact
path you're going to be like okay which
coffee shop do I need to go to I'm going
to walk this way today and then you'd
slowly form this habit that allows that
frees up more mental space but that's
just the thing you open yourself up to
potential chaos and so during this
period remember that we're still in a
period of feeling lost and we're trying
to get ourselves out by pursuing a new
goal so you need to stay mindful of
hints at a new purpose and don't let the
lessons of life pass you by you need to
set a new goal that you can perceive
life situations through the lens of that
goal again this leads to pattern
recognition dopamine collecting puzzle
pieces until the image is clear and what
I mean by this is that if you have a
goal like I want to get fit then you are
going to notice things in life that will
help you achieve that goal you're going
to notice oh there's a gym right there
oh there's a yoga studio right there oh
this tweet on the screen has given me
some great ideas for getting fit and if
you didn't have that goal goal or that
goal wasn't conscious then you aren't
going to register those things as
important and then the next is identify
the gap between you and your goals and
note problems standing in the way then
study build and experiment in alignment
with that goal so zoom out and think
what is the most pressing problem in
your life right now if it is the
unhappiness thing or the lack of peace
or just mental turmoil then refer to the
previous section on experimenting inward
but the your main
problem right now if you haven't
developed yourself to the point of
transcending these things are going to
fall within the Eternal markets of
health wealth relationships and
happiness so think about it what is your
biggest problem right now is it
self-esteem are you gonna have to get in
the gym uh do you feel sluggish all the
time like physically sluggish do you not
have any money in your bank account do
you not feel fulfilled in the work that
you're doing and you can sit with this
and contemplate now the other thing when
you identify this problem are you
actually able to work towards this
problem right now or is there another
problem that begets that problem that
you have to solve first like if you're
thinking okay I want to solve my money
problems what's the goal okay maybe I'll
start a business do you have time to
start a business do you have the
bandwidth to start a business possibly
possibly not if you don't then you need
to experiment with other techniques
first like starting a budget learning
about financing learning how to get a
better job studying a new skill so that
you can eventually start a business or
get a better job right you can't go from
zero to five you have to go from zero to
one and in terms of like self-esteem or
relationships if that's a problem in
your life and you want to attempt to get
a boy or girlfriend does that even make
sense right you have to step back and
think be honest with yourself are you in
the financial or even spiritual position
to be able to sustain a lifelong partner
now if your goal is different and you
just want to sleep around go ahead try
it out you learn from your mistakes as I
have in the past but that does not take
away from the fact that if you do that
and you eventually want a lifelong
partner you're
you're putting a veil in front of uh
your current problems and you're still
going to have to solve it and so once
you identify this goal that you want to
pursue you need to research and
experiment with techniques that allow
you to reach it and so as you progress
through this season of experimentation
which is a reframe of a season of
struggle Clarity begins to culminate
right it isn't immediate even though
when that last puzzle piece clicks into
place it is immediate and then that's
when you launch it to a season of
progress and during these seasons of
progress you will hit new highs right so
as you're experimenting outward and
inward you're going to reach new
baselines of happiness in either
direction like hitting a new monthly
high in business Revenue but you have to
understand that all highs come down a
bit like when you think of progress It's
a curve where it's like up and then down
but higher than last time and then up
higher than last time but down lower
than last time and then up higher than
last time so you're going to go up and
down down right and so we want to
sustain a certain Baseline and as you're
doing this in your season of intensity
you have to keep in mind the importance
of systems it's like bulking and cutting
and bodybuilding when you bulk you're
you feel great like at the start you're
like I'm eating more food my lifts are
going up and then you put on a bit too
much fat and in this case we're talking
about mental fat and then you start to
feel sluggish groggy and you're like man
maybe I took this a bit too far I feel
like I need to cut back and just start
from scratch but from a place of
Newfound muscle right the new Baseline
level of muscle that I've built and so
when it comes time to cut without a
proper system in place you're going to
lose a lot of that muscle right you
can't just cut super quick and try to
reach this other Baseline especially in
like business revenue or you could even
think about a connection of how this
happens in relationships so as you're
turning the final page
into like from a season of progress into
a season of experimentation when you hit
a new monthly high and you know it's
going to come back down you need to be
able to separate signal from noise what
are the levers that you have been
pursuing in your day and what just
doesn't belong there and when you focus
on the levers that are actually getting
you results and you're able to systemize
and make those habitual in your day make
them a part of your life then you can
start to sustain those higher baselines
the entirety of this process of
experimenting to solve your problems
gaining Clarity on a new chapter in life
pushing to new highs and systemizing the
process to maintain results is the
essence of life itself people have just
lost touch with it and in fact it's just
another perspective on the scientific
method so do what you will with this
information I am but another human that
pursued a goal figured it out and in
passing down my lessons I would
encourage you to do the same so that's
