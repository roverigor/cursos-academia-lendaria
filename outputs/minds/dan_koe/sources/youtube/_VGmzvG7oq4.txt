Have You Ever Had A Taste of the optimal
Human Experience you know that feeling
when nothing really matters you feel
extra confident you feel like you could
take on the world and you feel like you
were immersed you are at one with the
task that you are completing whether it
be a sport a game or just writing at
your computer some people call this
state the Flow State and that is a state
of consciousness where nothing else
matters except for what is right in
front of you what your attention is
immersed in you lose the sense of
self-consciousness and self-centeredness
that leads to anxiety or boredom or just
suffering in general as many of the
spiritual teachers and ancient Masters
would say so when you tap into this
state you cease to care what other
people think become one with the task
you are engaged in and know exactly what
to do next how well you are doing and
gain a deep sense of satisfaction from
it so as we'll talk about later
pertaining to self-consciousness and
self-centeredness leading to anxiety and
boredom the way that you end this kind
of suffering is by learning to control
your attention which is heavily
influenced by the ego or the self so
when you become self-conscious through
attention you notice something and you
become self-conscious because you're
comparing it to something you tend to
highlight the differences between
yourself and the thing that you are
comparing it to and so this split in
attention causes you to use precious
mental energy which could be focused
directly on the task at hand or whatever
you are trying to accomplish like when
you see a pimple on your skin in the
mirror and then an idea you don't even
have to be in direct contact with
someone who has clear skin to have an
idea of what clear skin is and the
perception of clear skin and then the
desire popping up to want clear skin but
you not being able to have it because of
the pimple on your face so you stop
start to compare ideas of what should be
rather than accepting things as they are
and refocusing your attention so the
question is how do we gain control of
our attention and the answer is by
treating life like the game it is so my
generation and other Generations but
mostly my generation from what I've
noticed is notorious for transferring
Obsession from video games to real life
or just business success because games
business or just constructions of the
external World in other words The Matrix
they present a desirable hierarchy of
goals they have a structure that frames
your attention they introduce a
challenge to narrow your attention
further and they require a player to
have the skill that meets the
requirements to play the game so what
few people understand is that you can
create a game out of any situation in
life as long as you can mold your mind
to create the certain aspects that a
game entails and if that game is fun to
you then life becomes more enjoyable
because you start playing rather than
being played and so the importance
behind this is that we're in a world
where it's create or be created so if
you can't mold your mind to create your
own reality or create your own game that
you play and you have fun playing in
life then your mind will be molded and
it already has been molded to play
external status games that Society has
created for you and these are things
like going to college getting a job or
just taking another structured approach
to life that someone else has laid out
for you but that may not be the best fit
for you and it just leads to unnecessary
suffering and pain and just not enjoying
your life because you're living you're
following the steps that someone else
has presented to you and that may not
align with the goals that you personally
have in this lifetime because that's
just the thing sovereign living or
autonomous living or just being
independent and building your own thing
your own way of survival is difficult
it's uncertain right and the mind craves
order it craves certainty so if there is
a path that is easier or more certain or
more secure for someone to take that's
where the masses flock that's where 99
of people flock and so the purpose of
this video is for awareness I know a lot
of you have similar values in goals as
mine and that is to build your own thing
be independent and break free of the
Matrix if you want to frame it that way
but to just live an enjoyable life on
your own terms so let's Dive In by
talking about the macro game of life so
when you're playing an open world
strategy game like World of Warcraft
there's a few patterns that we can
recognize the main ones being stacking
gold choosing a profession leveling up
your character and the progression that
goes along with those things but those
are just the common ones that's everyone
kind of knows that you've heard the
metaphor of life being a video game
before so let's take it a bit deeper and
let's really paint a picture here of
what's going on the system is rigged you
can't change it but you can learn it
that is how you rig yourself in the
system's favor so the conventional path
to success has already been programmed
into the collective psyche before we
know it due to the curse of knowledge
humans wanting to know more and learn
more and learning being the foundation
of the human experience that what we
that's what we do as we age as we just
learn new things over and over again and
we don't question those things so before
we even know it we're already in pursuit
of winning the game that other people
have laid out for us and that is usually
in favor of maintaining the game itself
right being trained into
the game to keep it going and ninety
percent of the time it just doesn't work
out that way you think that the the
secure path is secure but ninety percent
of people or however many percent of
people just end up with way too much
anxiety way too much stress way too much
overwhelm and and they get trapped in
this
jail or prison of their own doing and so
why is this or this video important
because times are changing they're
clearly changing more people are going
remote more people are choosing to do
their own thing the the flaws in the
system itself are revealing itself and
the programmers can't patch the game
fast enough who are the programmers I
have no idea but the just School
curriculums in general can't keep up
with the Creator economy who are giving
out they're educating people on how to
do their own thing and not get trained
into the conventional employment system
that the school is directly tied with
and other things like banking like
whatever your beliefs are about Bitcoin
or crypto or decentralized currency
there's a problem in the system and
somebody saw that and so now they are
individuals and small teams are Building
Solutions to create a better banking
system for people or just a better
Financial monetary system and then the
same thing with like huge agencies where
Freelancers who have a great skill set
and understand stand digital tools and
skills they're coming in as Freelancers
or contract workers and big companies
and just random people in general are
hiring them to do those jobs rather than
just hiring them as an employee so
there's those the people that are
actively trying to solve the problem of
this faulty system and then there are
those that in a video game would be
classified as an NPC or a non-player
character they're the people that just
do what they're told they go along with
the system they never question it and
they kind of just are there right so in
a video game it's the townsfolk it's
even like the the environment people so
the bosses in a battle and just others
that keep the game interesting for
players it allows it allows the game to
maintain its structure and keep on going
and then the people that question the
system and understand it from a big
picture can actually play the game and
navigate the game and have their own
success within that game so that was one
thing where the game is already there
the game is already out there and
programmed onto the collective psyche or
the hard drive right but the next thing
is that there are infinite paths that
you can take in an open world strategy
game like World of Warcraft so here's a
graphic
and I thought it was pretty clever
creating this where on the left you have
birth on the right you have death in the
middle line you have now and so you can
see the path that you've taken up until
now and that is your experience and then
the slightly darker circles that have
all the different paths on the right
those are the paths that you can take to
hit that green Little Dot that I've
labeled as success or winning the
external game winning the game of the
external world because in World of
Warcraft you have a series of choices
that you get to make what your character
looks like what kind of player they are
like a warrior Mage Rogue Etc what
profession they want to specialize in
the quest path that they want to take to
level up whether they play solo or with
a group what Guild they join to help
them level up faster in a series of
other personal choices that allow them
to play the game in an interesting way
right it's like people choosing what
sport they play when they are growing up
or or people that are trying to start a
business what skill they learn or what
business model they choose they're all
viable but they take a different skill
set and they lead people down a
different path that's like I always say
with the one person business model is
that your brand is your goal in life
right so if my goal is just the good
life or Financial Freedom or something
big and Broad like that my unique path
is what makes my brand unique right how
I'm going to achieve that goal is going
to be vastly different vastly unique my
story is going to be my brand it's going
to be What Separates Me from everyone
else and it allows me to create my own
personal Monopoly or mental Monopoly as
we'll talk about in the next video so
it's like if five people were standing
at the bottom of a mountain and life
being
infinite mountains so five people
standing at the bottom and they reach
the first Peak well first they look up
and they all draw a different paths on
how they're going to reach that first
Peak and then there's just infinite
mountains to climb but once you reach
that Peak you can look down and you can
help people navigate that path up in a
better way right that's what business is
is helping people solve their problems
or climb the mountain in a faster way to
achieve their desired outcome which is
reaching that Peak that you've reached
so the next thing that was there you can
take infinite pass to achieve success
but the next one is that leveling up
increases the complexity of the self so
in the real world the the main spiritual
problem is that people never change they
identify with their beliefs their jobs
or just another finite aspect of the
external constructed world and then once
they've reached that point of just like
static not wanting to change they don't
learn anymore they don't stack more
skills they don't level up to the point
of more opportunities being available to
them so by improving your skill set by
learning and executing and taking on
challenges it allows you to take on
higher level challenges and by taking on
higher level challenges you give you
open up room to take on a lot more or
have a lot more opportunities because
that knowledge and experience expands
your awareness of what is actually
possible so in a video game it's you
level up to a point eventually let's say
you reach the max level you can navigate
the world freely stress free you can do
whatever you want you can fly across the
map you can teleport you can do all this
crazy stuff now this is all metaphorical
pertaining to the real world but just by
Inc consistently learning and increasing
your skill level and taking on
challenges in like going up the ladder
of challenges then you're able to take
on you're able to do so much more in
this world and pick your battles from
then on so as you develop yourself you
gain more ability to create order from
chaos you have the power to create a
game out of more situations in life and
so that overall structure that we just
talked about all of those things talking
about it in terms of like World of
Warcraft or an open world strategy game
that represents the macro game of life
but it goes a bit deeper and we can talk
about the micro games of Life on like a
situation to situation basis so the
first thing we need to do is set a
hierarchy of goals so games present the
big goal of winning but then they also
have Clarity on how to reach that goal
with sub goals like quests because if
there was only the one goal of winning
and you had no idea how to get there
then the game wouldn't be fun because as
humans we have the ability to aim with
our minds into the future like monkeys
they can they can throw their poop but
it's usually hurled just like straight
at the ground they usually don't hit
something that is straight in front of
them but humans on the other hand with
skill and practice and time someone can
throw a football 50 yards out and hit a
bullseye on a Target now the same is
very similar with the mind in creating a
vision for your future and then slowly
leveling up until you are able to create
that Vision so we don't want to be poop
hurled at the ground like how monkeys do
we want to have a vision that we can
build towards but if we don't want to
get overwhelmed by this Grand Vision for
our future then we have to create sub
goals in order to get there so I would
recommend that you sit down with a pen
and paper or you can use my power
planner which is free Link in the
description to create the first
iteration of your vision understand it's
an iteration it doesn't have to be
perfect then create a 10-year one-year
and monthly goals again these don't have
to be perfect just get the first
iteration out and you can come back to
it have a place for weekly Direction and
reflection and then align your daily
priority tasks with those and now now
with these written down this is
important and most people don't
understand why because they've never
done it but it's important because
writing these things down it's like an
anchor we talked about two videos ago
how I remember everything I learned that
you should learn and build in unison you
need something to build so that you have
something to apply your learnings to and
then your awareness starts to register
more opportunities for what you're
building right because humans compared
to animals that survive on a physical
level we survive on a conceptual level
right we try to survive our beliefs and
other things that we've identified and
attached with so it only makes sense
that we would try to survive a project
or we would try to survive our vision
for the future and because of that since
that is at the top of our mind we're
going to notice things that we can apply
to that vision and then clarify it
further and continue striving towards it
so that was setting a hierarchy of goals
but next we need to understand the frame
of the game so your perspective of or
your world view is the frame in which
you view reality it's like a camera so
the field of view even if the background
is blurred constrains what registers in
the frame itself so by molding your
perspective in any situation you allow
yourself to perceive what used to be a
huge problem as a minor Road bump
because if I'm so dead set on the
hierarchy of goals that I've created my
vision for my future and the goals
related to that and my attention is
narrowed in on that then it's going to
be difficult for a distraction to
register in the camera itself right or
in the perspective itself so in a video
game there are two things that help
create order or order Consciousness or
create this Frame of the game something
that you need to focus on and narrowing
your attention on so the first thing is
rules every single video game has a set
of rules that you must follow and when
we play the game this allows us to use
our limited conscious attention or Focus
to remain focused on the hearing now
while keeping our vision or the end goal
of winning in the back of our head this
is important because in Psychology when
you are kind of projecting into the
future or you have a desire something
that you do not have that is when
dopamine spurts into your brain but when
you are focused on the here and now
that's when the Here and Now chemicals
like oxytocin serotonin and other
neurochemicals like that that's when
those spurred into your brain and so if
you read the book The Art of Impossibles
by Stephen Cutler it doesn't say this
directly but it it mentions that flow
the flow state is kind of a
neurochemical cocktail of all of these
different neurotransmitters going to
your brain and this can be accomplished
by
exactly this so in the real world your
rules are your values right that's on
the macro scale and the micro scale you
can create different rules like when
you're going on a walk and you just you
set rules to never step on a crack right
or to walk 2500 steps or something like
that and so in terms of values when you
act in alignment with those values and
you constrain your attention to the
things that are in alignment with those
life becomes a bit more enjoyable and so
on the micro scale of everyday
situations Clarity comes from
eliminating environmental distractions
right and that pretty much means
creating a frame so like when you're
trying to do deep work and the common
advice is to close your browser tabs set
a timer like Pomodoro have clear steps
for your work and use things like noise
canceling headphones and so like how I
mentioned with creating rules for going
on something like a walk because I used
to hate going on walks even though even
though I knew how healthy it was for me
to do so you can create little rules for
that to either turn what used to be
mundane situations into enjoyable or to
just gain perspective and start enjoying
situations that you would normally hate
because let's say you hate watching
sports I don't like watching sports
right I just don't like football I don't
understand it and that is the exact
point I don't understand the game if I
knew the game and was able to manipulate
my attention to follow what's going on
in the game then I may be able to enjoy
it or if uh your spouse or your wife or
your girlfriend she likes going out and
looking at antiques uh just on like a
Saturday afternoon and you don't want to
do that and you're just dragging your
feet the entire time and you're like oh
I don't want to be here I don't like
doing this but she creates a game out of
it she's like oh I like the price on
this one I like the look of this one and
she's in there having a very enjoyable
time in some degree of a flow State and
you can do the same thing if you just
zoom out gain some perspective and
create your own game out of it whatever
that may be even if it's as simple as
like finding the stupidest rock you can
find or finding the stupidest antique
right and then you both have your own
fun playing your own game so that was
rules the second thing is mechanics so
if you haven't played a game before it's
it's not going to be that fun your aim
is going to suck you'll have to practice
on low level challenges and you're going
to look at top level players and you're
going to be awestruck about how good
they are at playing the game so every
game has a specific way for you to
channel more of your senses thoughts and
prior experience to play it better so in
a video game it's pressing a series of
keys buttons or Mouse Clicks in board
games it's the effectiveness creativity
or forward thinking that goes into your
strategy in sports it's the conditioning
of your body and how you move it in
accordance with the goal and in all of
the above it's your perception of the
situation or your frame of the game that
allows you to choose in a way that moves
you towards winning and so another form
of information is feedback feedback is
important here to know how well you're
you're doing in the game because all of
this Games Etc it's ordering our
Consciousness it's giving us structured
information to pay attention to and our
mind likes that and so if you do
something and you know that it was the
wrong move or you made a mistake then
your perspective or your frame widens to
the point of allowing distractions to
penetrate that field and then if you
give attention to that distraction then
you're going to be off the game and
you're not going to enjoy it as much so
how do we improve our mechanics or just
our skill relating to the game and it's
practice of course right when you're
playing a video game like World of
Warcraft people log in every single day
to perform a repetitive series of tasks
they go and farm for gold they create
their armor they mine fur or or they
Farm XP by going through dungeons over
and over again so you have to program
the specific mechanic in your brain to
the point of where you're getting
results with less effort in other words
habit formation so if you can automate
to an extent the decisions that you make
on a daily basis that are conducive with
your hierarchy of goals and achieving
your end Vision then success kind of
becomes inevitable so we've talked about
setting a hierarchy of goals and
creating a frame for the game that
you're playing now this is arguably the
most important part is the delicate
balance between anxiety and boredom so
here's another graphic this one is
adapted from mihai chikcept mihai with
his books flow and the evolving self
highly highly recommend you check those
out but you can see here that in the top
quadrant there's anxiety or
self-consciousness in the middle there's
flow or selflessness and then at the
bottom there's boredom or
self-centeredness and on the right Axis
there's skill level and on the top I
mean on the left axis there is the
challenge level so the skill challenge
match is extremely important here so
when you start playing a game especially
when you haven't read the rule book or
you've never played before is it going
to be fun no of course it's not and even
if you knew the rules it's still going
to take time for you to grasp what's
going on in the game so this is why I
always recommend just starting right
just start something if you don't know
how you just start with what you know
and then you learn on the go and get
real world experience do not get trapped
in tutorial hell I this is one of my
less popular videos but it is the most
important is how I remember everything I
learned because if you were a level one
in World of Warcraft and you were
fighting a level 50 would it be fun no
you'd lose immediately but the thing
here as we know is that you can create a
better frame for that game right if you
just have to if you're a level one and
you have to play against the level 50
how can you mold your perspective to
create a better frame for that game like
if you instead of beating the level 50
as your goal what if the goal was to see
how fast you could lose against the
level 50 then it'd be kind of fun and
you'd be interested in playing the game
and it's the same thing with something
like chess right if you are just
starting out playing chess and you're
going against like your friend who's
been playing for years or like you
decide to enter a competition for some
reason without having ample experience
and years of practice under your belt
it's just not going to be a good time so
the lesson is if your skill is high and
the challenge is low you're going to get
bored and if your skill is low and the
challenge is high you're going to get
anxious in the boredom stems from
self-centeredness your focus breaks from
the task at hand and something else
comes to mind that you'd rather be doing
another desire right so if you're bored
at work it's usually because you're not
immersed in the task that your work
presents and you're sitting there bored
thinking self-centeredly about the
better things you could be doing with
your time and the anxiety comes from
self-consciousness so if the challenge
is too high and your skill is too low
your attention is going to turn towards
the concept of self and again you're
going to allow distractions or problems
to penetrate your your awareness or your
conscious field and then your attention
just starts going downhill from there so
as an example it's like
if your skill is too low you're going to
start thinking these thoughts where it's
like wow I'm not as good as I thought or
wow I really need to work on my
backswing or in a more practical
situation it's like that girl is way out
of my league do you see how this is more
self-conscious here where you are paying
attention to your current skill level in
relation to the skill that is required
to play the game so how do we prevent
this it's like the very start of the
video video where I mentioned that
people don't change they don't evolve
they aren't constantly learning and
constantly building it has to happen if
you want an enjoyable life you need
something to immerse your attention in
and continuously progress at that
throughout life and develop yourself
into a complex being that can take on
bigger broader and bigger and broader
challenges and just have more
opportunity in the world that you can
pick and choose and play games at this
point in our history it should be
possible for an individual to build a
self that is not simply the outcome of
biological Drive lives and cultural
habits but a conscious personal creation
mihai chicks at mihai so I remember the
first time I downloaded World of
Warcraft when I was a young kid probably
like 15 years old and I spent a straight
two hours just creating my character and
playing around with how I wanted him to
look while also considering the game
itself so I think about the Minor
Details of what race I can be we don't
really have that choice but
metaphorically paint a picture for
yourself uh what race I would be what
class I would have was I going to be a
warrior a mage a priest did I want to be
a tank a damaged character A Healer how
did I want my hair to look how did I did
I want to be a human did I want to be an
orc did I want to be something like that
and then also while I was paying
attention to that I was also paying
attention to how it was going to favor
my personality or my playstyle in order
to actually win the game and the
challenges associated with winning the
game and it's the same thing like when
you hit Level 15 or something and you
can start like riding a horse or you can
choose your profession right what was I
going to be was I going to be a
blacksmith was I going to be an armor
Creator I forget what they're called but
like you create armor was it going to be
a leather worker a cloth worker for a
tailor or was I going to be like those
people that like put gems together and
make other cool weapon power-ups and so
once I made that choice it opened up a
series of talents and traits that I was
able to choose after that and then once
I have leveled those talents or traits
to a specific point I was given more
choices that weren't originally
available to me right I was able to do
more dungeons I was able to raid with my
friends I was accepted into certain
guilds because they had certain
requirements for what they needed did
they need a Healer did they need more
damage did they need a tank what level
or experience were those people and what
were they accepting and so touching on
this again of how learning is the
foundation of the Human Experience when
we are young we don't know any better
and we learn these things just through
repetition they are conditioned into our
psyche and a self a concept of the self
is created that we didn't really have
much control over so learning through
any medium influences our thoughts and
our thoughts influence our Behavior
meaning that anything you learn or
consume is going to impact either
directly or indirectly how you act and
move within this world and what
opportunities you perceive as available
to you so winning the game of Life
business or any present moment situation
you are in is dependent on how your
character perceives and acts within that
specific situation so if we want to
achieve or create the life of our dreams
then we have to create the character or
the player that will lead to that
outcome so how do we create our
character first it's by integrating
everything that we've talked about in
this video you need an intrinsic
hierarchy of goals you need to
understand how to frame not only your
life on the macro scale and the micro
scale in everyday situations and
creating rules for YouTube to narrow
your attention and focus on that and
then you need to consistently learn
practice learn practice or learn build
learn build in order to increase your
skill set and take on higher challenges
and then the second thing is through
self-education and self-reflection
because thankfully we live in an age
where all information is at the tip of
our fingers if you have a problem you
can usually find some form of a solution
to it on the Internet or just in a book
or something like that and so you find
these ideas as you're creating a better
life for yourself and encountering
problems on the way by just consuming
valuable information and not getting
distracted and sometimes you have to sit
sift through dirt to find gold you have
to read things that you aren't
necessarily interested in and those that
get bored doing those things will
normally just distract themselves
instead because they aren't interested
and so with that self-education or just
consistently learning self-reflection is
how you guide future decision making
because it is impossible to have 100
certainty in the actions you take now
and how they're going to impact your
future right cause and effect you don't
immediately have the effect of your
actions you just have to take them and
then when you do to take those actions
the only way you can know if they were
good or bad you you can know if they're
good or bad by taking advice from
someone else or kind of comparing it to
someone else's results but the only way
you're truly going to know for certain
whether they were good or bad actions is
through self-reflection and then
pivoting from there because even if you
took advice from someone else or you
know what your actions are going to
leave lead to you're operating from a
completely different world view in a
completely different environment from
whoever gave you that advice or wherever
you learned it from right if you're
taking advice from uh Socrates from
hundreds of years ago for right now in
this environment where money rules the
world it may not be as practical as you
think and you still need to filter
through direct experience so let's do a
quick recap on what we talked about
games are a way of ordering
Consciousness to the point of obsession
when you're obsessed you stop caring
what people think and play to win
according to your values games are
enjoyable and every situation in life
can be mentally molded into a game if
you want to avoid mental turmoil your
skill needs to match the challenge that
any situation presents your perspective
will determine the information available
to you and if it's not structured you
will misperceive it yourself a concept
is the player with time you want to
create the character that can win the
games that it is best at so I hope you
