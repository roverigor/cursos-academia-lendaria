your future will be determined by three
things the first is one big decision to
go all in and of course this takes time
you need to expose yourself to
experience not distraction in order to
find the thing that you want to go all
in on you don't just you don't
automatically know what it is that you
want to go all in on you have to break
out of your little bubble of comfort in
order to expose yourself to the
potential of your life you don't have an
obsession or a passion or something that
you want to dedicate your life to like
your life's work because you haven't
made forward progress in order to become
aware of it because the thing that you
are going to potentially be obsessed
with or passionate about it doesn't come
from sitting around and waiting for it
to come to you you don't have an
obsession or a passion or something to
dedicate your life to because you
haven't made forward progress in this
world you haven't been exposed to the
thing that allows you to become exposed
to the next thing and then the next and
the next and if you are just sitting
around wasting away on video games
Netflix porn and all this other [ __ ] and
again
you can enjoy life but if you aren't
making forward progress then you
shouldn't be enjoying life in excess
because the thing is here you may not
know what exists you at this moment in
time in the left hemisphere of your
brain the thing that controls the known
it's either the right or the left it's
one of them but it controls what you
know that is the only thing you know
that's what you operate within when you
are not stressed when you're calm when
you're sitting at home when you're going
about your day-to-day life in your
routine you are not usually becoming
aware of things that can bring new
potentials to your life so to overcome
this and start actually making progress
you have to adopt the mindset of a
problem solver that's what every single
successful person does if you study the
patterns of successful people you will
realize that they are obsessed with
solving the problems in their life
because the problems are the gate to
becoming exposed to the potentials of
your life Benji lay down bro so start by
solving the biggest problem in your life
the one that you're putting off because
you think you should be working on your
passion or your obsession or something
that's going to lead to something
absolutely incredible and just have you
make a leap in Consciousness and
progress in this world without taking
the steps to get there and if you've
never done this you have to start with
the shallow problems in your life be
honest with yourself here find the
burning problem in your life are you
overweight do you hate your job are you
tired all the time did you just go
through a breakup are you plagued with
negative emotions sit with the
discomfort don't avoid it so that was
the first thing that your future will be
determined by is one big thing to go all
in on but you have to find that thing
the second thing you focus on is
repetitive focused action so once you
have a goal which is the polar end of
the problem that you're going to solve
then you need to learn how to solve it
first right you can't just go straight
into solving the problem don't be
assassinated [ __ ] come here you're
making noise
so it's obvious that you have to educate
yourself in order to achieve a specific
and meaningful goal that someone else
did not set for you but most people just
adopt a victim mindset and hide behind
their static identity they know they can
educate themselves they know that there
is opportunity out there in order to
solve their problems they know that it's
going to take a certain amount of time
but they don't want to face reality and
so they eliminate all of their
responsibility for themselves and just
blame others so to do this scour the
internet buy books buy courses buy
coaching buy mentorship by any piece of
information that you can related to your
goal in order to immerse yourself and
marinate your mind in that information
so you have no choice but to overcome it
and along the way you will pick up
subtle whys or reasons to keep you
motivated to hit that goal and so along
with the reasoning or the why and
motivation to keep going you'll also
pick up the fundamentals right you will
notice patterns when you are consuming
information from a variety of sources
and those are the fundamentals or the
principles or the lever moving actions
that you should be focused on every
single day so when it comes to losing
weight if you're overweight and tired
and you realize that there's this whole
cascading effect behind your health
problems that you need to start solving
then you understand okay calories in
calories out is a fundamental here I
should probably track my calories for a
week going to the gym or just some form
of exercise is good we need to start
small we need to build up from there
let's go to the gym for 15 minutes today
or when starting a business you realize
that the fundamentals or principles are
traffic and offers same with dating so
if you don't have a product or service
or the value to create one or the
education in what goes into a product or
service and I mean in terms of dating
that's also you need to cultivate your
value so this is why dating and
relationships usually come last after
you've solved your health and
relationships problems but then once you
have an offer or a product or service or
valuable being then you need people you
need traffic to send to it right so the
lever moving actions or fundamentals of
business aside from creating an offer
are building distribution of some form
so social media is a good way to go
about it so your fundamental level
moving actions are
replying to larger accounts you know the
basic social media advice that no one
listens to but is talked about in every
single course and article you read
online you just have to stick it out and
be aware of the problems and the lack of
results that you're getting in order to
educate yourself further with specific
knowledge in order to overcome that it's
also simple but people just
they don't want to face that reality or
they can't zoom out and see beyond a
week's worth of lack of results before
they call it a scam or quit because
they're so used to things just being
handed to them like a job and a paycheck
and all of these other things that they
didn't they had to work for but not
every single day they didn't have to
forge their own path to get there and so
that leads into the third thing so the
first thing is one big decision to go
all in on one thing the second is
repetitive focused actions on the
fundamentals that will bring results and
the third is the ability to persist and
iterate persistency yes that's a word
and iteration is greater than
consistency and repetition now I
remember we just said repetitive focused
action I should have said persistent
focused action because we don't want to
always rely on motivation you can clean
the dishes and you can clean the dishes
well even if you don't feel like doing
that and that applies to anything you
can go and you can take out the garbage
can even if you don't feel like it when
your mom told you to take out the
garbage can you can move your body in a
specific way to get a specific result
out of reality even if you do not feel
like doing it because there is one thing
that is guaranteed here it is going to
be difficult life is difficult reality
does not just take away difficulty life
isn't all hunky-dory and
butter scotches and Roses or whatever
the [ __ ] that saying is it's going to be
difficult and to hold the expectation
that it's going to be easy because you
watched a little YouTube video on the
exact strategies I took to get to one
million dollars and didn't take into
account the years of effort before that
you need to ground yourself in reality
and understand that it is going to be
difficult and that you will have to
persist through that and there there
will be days where you have to show up
and do the work even if you don't feel
like it because it isn't supposed to be
any other way and those that think it is
supposed to be easy are the ones that
don't get results you have to be a
failure approach the girl and get
rejected look like an idiot in the gym
start the business and watch people
criticize your first moves everyone else
did it invest in your portfolio of
failures until you can afford to succeed
that's it like subscribe links in the
