if i could attribute my progress to one
thing it would be
clarity and i'm sure many other
successful or people that have made a
lot of progress can agree with me here
that clarity or ordered consciousness or
the ability to create based on a
specific vision
they have for the future of a project
for their life for anything macro micro
on all planes of reality
is how you see immense progress in this
world clarity is what makes focus
seamless it's what makes you
channel your attention through focus it
makes that process seamless and i'm sure
many of you can assume where i'm going
with this with the age of information
and technological advancements and
distractions being thrown at you from
all directions focus is an absolute must
in this world as a kid when i was around
plus or minus 12 years old i can vividly
remember myself sitting in the back seat
of
my dad's old chevy blazer i believe it
was a chevy the old blazers right i
would sit back there with a notebook and
i would just sit and draw and try to tap
into whatever creative ability i had at
that time and most of the time what i
drew was like a humanoid type feature
either like a robot or a muscular man
some of them had halos some of them had
horns right it to me it showed
my ability as a child that everyone has
and everyone can tap into to just create
something
that mimics life as i grew up this
notebook of mine or the multitude of
notebooks of mine
gained
a new purpose they were less about
drawing imaginary figures and they
became more about about
creating or visualizing imaginary
futures right you see this all the time
with
some self-help or self-improvement
people is that they are very big on
writing out goals writing out their
vision for the future what they want to
achieve what they can work towards right
and what they're doing here is they are
creating clarity they're creating
clarity so they are able to act in
accordance whether it be consciously
subconsciously or even sometimes
unconsciously
in alignment with that vision for their
future they are planting a seed in their
head that their actions can follow
because think about it if you don't do
this and you aren't being intentional
you aren't stretching towards something
that's
almost quite literally what
intention means from the latin root is
to stretch towards something to pay
attention to something in the future to
focus on something and allow your
actions to follow what you are focused
on and what you are stretching towards
now i
am
iffy on the concept of like affirmations
and manifestation and all this stuff
that can be quickly misinterpreted by if
you aren't congruent with the voice that
you are hearing those words from it can
quickly be misinterpreted into
something
like oh you're you're just the law of
attraction what's that manifestation
what are you doing you're just imagining
things without action and all of this
other stuff but no you have to
from my perspective you are framing your
focus as we said earlier you are
aligning your actions whether it be
consciously subconsciously or
unconsciously to
manifest what you want in your life and
if i can think back it's insane that i'm
sitting here in this room right now
because as a kid when i would go and
visit my sister
she lived in texas
she lived on this strip this very
city
big city type feel
where there were shops downstairs she
lived in a high-rise apartment the
apartment was super nice and i was just
a kid sitting at home
in my room playing video games and all
this other stuff and i would
consistently imagine myself living in a
location like that it had always been a
dream of mine a dream of mine to
be able to walk anywhere i want to have
things that are close to me to live in a
nice environment with trees right
outside of my window rather than a
desert which i used to live in in
arizona and
i've been thinking about this a lot and
this is a very big topic that we're
about to dive into but i now live
in a very similar location that my
sister used to live in i live in texas i
live on a street where there's a ton of
shopping malls i walk to a coffee shop
every morning i'm gonna walk to the gym
after this i barely have to drive i have
great food all around me i'm very
grateful for all of this stuff by the
way
but it's kind of just mind-blowing to
think about how that happened awareness
begets awareness
thoughts beget thoughts ideas beget
ideas i can go on and on about this you
cannot become aware of something up here
if you were not first aware of the
something here right we talk about this
concept of the unknown all the time and
we think of it as a map in a video game
where
the areas that you have not explored or
become aware of they're not available to
you you're not conscious of them you
don't know what is there you can only
assume what is there and so you have to
reach one location before you reach the
next and eventually you create this
network that you can tap into with your
awareness to pull from to not only be
creative
in your endeavors but to just expand
your mind and open your mind to new
perspectives new realities in a sense
and all of that fun stuff and my point
with this is is that you cannot create a
positive future reality for yourself if
you have not first imagined it right if
you don't have that order consciousness
on what you are trying to create you
don't have the clarity on the future
that you're trying to actualize or
create for yourself then there it's
going to be very difficult for that to
be manifested or created or your actions
just lead to that point in life
because you could imagine it first it
has to be imagined and vice versa you
can only create a negative reality for
yourself
because you have already imagined and
then experienced something and that
brings up what i believe to be one of
the biggest problems that we are facing
today as humans because
humans are the only ones that can really
face this big problem because of our
advanced cognitive abilities and the big
problem i'm talking about here is
psychological time or linear time and
when i say psychological time is you can
visualize
a
a past experience that you were already
made aware of notice how i'm saying
aware here
you can envision
a time in your life where you felt
terrible where you were in emotional
turmoil and all of these bad things were
happening to you and if you do not uh
order your consciousness or focus on
that point in time
correctly or in a positive way then you
are quite literally pulling that
experience into the now you are feeling
that same experience that you felt then
you're feeling stressed maybe you
are reminiscing on a past experience
like you had a bad breakup and you're
starting to experience the same feelings
and emotions that you were experiencing
at that time and as you repeat these
things
in psychological time the familiar past
possibly negative and the
uh predictable future because you've
already lived out experiences and you're
projecting into a future that you can
imagine and visualize very clearly and
if that's negative you can pull that
experience into the now and have those
feelings thoughts emotions etc and the
more you do this and you allow this
possibly unconscious behavior
of projecting into the predictable
future or reminiscing on the familiar
past you are quite literally hardwiring
neural networks in your brain related to
those experiences so that becomes your
personality if you want to dive more
into this i would recommend reading
becoming supernatural by joe dispenza he
does a much better job at explaining the
science behind this and i'm not too
interested
in the science it's not very congruent
with me i like the spiritual aspect i
can apply that to my life very easily
where other people they're more
congruent with the scientific
uh point of view regarding those same
topics it's just a different lens of
viewing it
and they're able to apply that to their
life much better but that's one thing
that i pulled from it is that as you are
doing this you are hardwiring those
neural networks that's what conditioning
programming is our mind kind of mimics
uh
a harmonic oscillator or a system right
and that's what the neural networks in
our minds do they're hardwired and it
makes it habitual to tap into that
experience so you wake up and you
immediately think oh stressful boss at
work you pull that stressful experience
into the now you have those chemicals
throughout your body and it can quite
literally cause you to be sick by living
as your past self
or
just thinking about
the predictable future of like oh this
is going to happen to me and you think
that you imagine it first awareness
begets awareness and what do you know
it happens you actualize that vision now
the only way to solve this problem is
one becoming conscious of those negative
thought patterns and experiences but at
the same time it's diving into the
unknown because
as humans we love that familiarity we
love habits we love being able to
automate thought processes and take
shortcuts that's what we that's our
survival mechanism in our brain was okay
this past experience happened it caused
a negative experience it threatened my
survival i need to remember this for
later and i need to kind of
create this system in the body possibly
don't take this with a grain of salt
this is speculation but
it creates a system where okay this
thing caused a reaction this caused a
negative experience in me and now i'm
experiencing that and living in this
stressful
internal environment
because my body and my mind thinks it's
being threatened
on a physical survival level
you see what i'm saying here so we have
to dive into the unknown we have to
think new thoughts we have to
have new ideas we have to
gain awareness that we didn't have
before by doing the hard thing and kind
of leaning
into the discomfort of life that will
threaten our survival
and you have to come at this from
a perspective of hey this isn't actually
threatening my survival this isn't going
to kill me this may kill a few of my
beliefs
which is going to cause that
stress response
but at the same time it's just a belief
and you are able to create these new
ones that will lead to a beneficial
future for yourself so i wrote a tweet
and this is a concept of mine it's
called tactical stress
it says tactical stress is the conscious
decision to put yourself in a do or die
situation knowing that you have the
skill to make it work and will accept
nothing less from success so what this
is saying what i did personally when i
had the clarity and the vision of what i
wanted to do
i made it so that i had to act on that
urgency right and what i meant by that
is
i wanted to move into a new location it
wasn't this one but it was a step down
from this a step up from my last one
whereas a nice place nice pool the rent
was way above my level but i knew i had
the skill to make more money
through
the internet with my skill set branding
marketing sales all of that fun stuff
that allowed me to do that because i
exposed myself to it before i had that
awareness i had the ideas that beget
this new idea of what i'm able to do
with those skills so i knew the money
was there now the only thing that i had
to do was put myself in that environment
i signed the lease even though i wasn't
able to afford it at the time and that
caused something in me i i just was
taking action left and right i was
moving these levers that allowed me to
make more money and free up more time
for myself and afford this place and
that is when i hit my first 50k month as
a consultant now
of course use common sense here
this is not my responsibility for what
you do and it's kind of my
responsibility but make a wise
decision with what i'm saying here now
with this this brings up the concept of
risk and i would argue that 90 plus
percent of the population are a walking
contradiction they say they think
something like that is a risk when it
will bring massive reward but what's
riskier you you tell me think about this
what's riskier
diving into the discomfort that life
holds
where
a positive potential future
lies for yourself or
repeating the same familiar uh thoughts
beliefs and experiences that you have
had for
the past 10 years of your life which is
more risky
which is more risky now we're going back
to clarity the greatest skill that you
can develop of the 21st century clarity
and connection
another tweet of mine
clarity primes you to get into flow
clarity primes you to make the sale
clarity primes you not to overthink the
ability to order consciousness in
yourself and others
is the most valuable skill of the 21st
century clarity is what brings action
you to get clarity we will go over this
soon you need a vision for your future
you need a hierarchy of goals to get
there and you need prioritized
simplified low friction tasks that just
make it easy to actualize that vision on
any plane of reality whether it be a
project that you're working on a social
situation that you're uncomfortable with
going through or just your life as a
whole so this presents a concept that i
have been working on for the past two or
three years i called it originally the
creation hierarchy it was a bunch of
steps and it started with a vision you
break it down into a big goal small call
intention consistency curiosity and i
had all these things there and i knew
that there was something more to it i
knew that there was
a way to package all of this up into
a simple way but this simple way has a
lot of depth to it i'm writing an entire
 book on this thing and it can't
be explained in one graphic or one video
and i will continue to piece together
the puzzle for you in future videos but
for now i'm going to throw up a graphic
i would highly recommend that you
screenshot this graphic
and study it
and try to make connections to this as
you're going about your day-to-day
experience so this is the creation
pyramid i put it up on the screen and at
the top you have your experience
your experience next is vision then
goals then process drive and focus
under that you have your state of
consciousness the energy to create
intrinsic alignment and everything to go
along with that so let's dive into this
a bit the first thing is to think about
this from an immaterial perspective not
a material perspective right we're
imagining things here this isn't a
physical this isn't matter right because
you there there's the common saying of
like you need to act in alignment with
who you want to become and a lot of
people mistake this as oh i'm just going
to fake it till i make it like i'm going
to fake results until i have those
results when that's not the case if you
can reminisce on the past and bring that
experience to your present reality like
if you
have that negative experience with a
breakup and then you are feeling those
same emotions you can do the same
in the unknown aspects of life if you
can visualize it clearly and this
experience that comes with that because
one thing you i guarantee and this may
cause something in you you don't want
that fancy mansion you don't want that
fancy car you don't want that hot sexy
girlfriend you don't want that big
muscular body you and you do want those
things i'm not saying you like
absolutely don't want those things but
it's
you may be misinterpreting
what you actually want
because there's only one thing that you
have and that is your present experience
you want the experience that comes from
getting those things you've been
conditioned your whole life you're like
oh that guy has a mansion he looks like
he's having fun he's driving the sports
car around he has this adrenaline
flowing through him and when you see
that you get a little bit of that
experience right that's what you want
and if you come out all of this from an
immaterial perspective rather than oh i
want that fancy car it's like no you
visualize your future and the experience
that comes along with that like when you
imagine a vacation you were previously
on and the experience that was with that
the feelings the emotions and you can
kind of feel that experience in the now
that's what i'm talking about here
that's energy when you bring your focus
and your attention and your
consciousness to this thing that you
want to create you can pull energy into
the now in order to help you actualize
it that's
a big part of that graphic that i threw
up where
where you bring your focus
there is potential energy there
everything is energy everything is
information everything is frequencies
frequencies hold information and your
ability to process
and interpret that information in a
positive way in order to
raise your vibration
so to say
that's just a huge plus and it allows
you to bring that experience into the
now and live a better life and create a
better life so that was the top of the
pyramid that was experience right the
little white part of the pyramid
that is experience the next thing is
vision and creating a crystal clear
vision for your future and now it's not
don't overthink this don't project don't
don't do certain don't misinterpret this
when i say crystal clear
this is a process of time because right
now you are
kind of
reaching into the unknown and trying to
create something with the information
and energy that is there right you are
trying to form something that allows you
to tap into that experience now i want
to
make this comparison
when i am writing
here's a content creation tip when i'm
writing anything and i
have this slight vision of what i want
to create i have the idea for the actual
video
but
i don't know what to write i sit down to
write and nothing comes to mind so the
way that you that i have grown to start
to create these things is i will outline
it first and if you outline something
this isn't just for content this could
be your life for
the situation that you're going into
when you get home and you're going to
see your kids is it going to be positive
or negative how is that
conversation going to flow what reality
are you going to create so you create an
outline of this stuff you create an
outline of your vision right
and then what that allows you to do
you've kind of set like anchor points
you've ordered some consciousness in the
unknown and now as you go about
day-to-day life now that you're aware of
these things it allows you to become
aware of the things that apply to that
right when i outline
let's say this video right i outline
this video and then i go on a walk and
i'm maybe listening to an audio book or
i'm talking to people
i can connect those experiences it
really doesn't matter what i'm reading i
could read about
like mechanical engineering and
something will stick out because
everything's the same everything's
connected and it will give me
inspiration
for what i'm actually creating it will
fill in the holes
of my
uh
vision my outline for my vision of what
i'm trying to achieve
at that point in time and this doesn't
only happen when you're like consuming
things but your subconscious when you do
that and you make an intention to fill
that out your subconscious will start to
pick up and send information to your
conscious mind to fill that out it's
like gary halbert i think
or david ogilvy or really most writers
what they do is they brainstorm they
outline everything and then they
off they go they do nothing they lay out
by the pool they listen to
some music they go and they have a fun
night out and the idea the perfect idea
pops into their brain they have that
breakthrough that aha moment and they
are able to come back and create better
this is a constant process of iteration
refining your macro vision for the life
you are trying to create now the next
step
and we talk about this a lot and this is
the over
encompassing concept this entire video
will
will form the foundation of every other
video i've posted ever
that's how big this is and so the next
step is you we have experience we have
the vision the next step is goals so
breaking it down and trying to get
clarity this can also be considered an
outline right you see what i'm saying
here is where
you are creating
goals here and there to gain more
clarity and allow yourself to make more
connections through your everyday
experience to
gain that clarity on actualizing that
vision now a lot of this depends the
goal setting here depends on how big or
small this vision is you can even think
of the goals as microvisions
in themselves right so if we are
thinking on the long time span of life
you can break it down into more
chunked down goals where you have maybe
a 10-year goal
and then you have a one-year goal and
then a monthly goal and then a weekly
goal and then even a daily goal or just
priorities like everything is a goal and
this is why video games as we talked
about in the last
video are so addictive is and this is
why
we do what we do as a whole is because
either culture or ourselves or our
parents or other things have constructed
a hierarchy of goals that allows us to
actualize a specific vision that those
goals stem from it's like a quest in a
game do this do this do this and you
will receive
this
vision that you can imagine in the
experience that comes along with that
now again
this is number four by the way we have
experiment we have vision we have goals
and now we have as number four process
a process that we can repeatedly execute
on in order to
actualize that vision and
hit the hierarchy of goals that we have
created now i really like to think of
life or really anything whatever the
vision we create is whether it's for our
life or for a specific situation in this
very moment or even like a week-long
vision or whatever it may be
i like to think of all of this
as a science project or an experiment
everything is an experiment because
that's the thing is scientists they have
a hypothesis
they have some kind of vision for what
results they are trying to get do they
create a replicable process for getting
that result right away no
they take time they test they analyze
results they follow the scientific
process which i'm throwing up on the
screen which is they observe
they research hypothesis experiment
analyze and then they get the result
and so
patience surrender
faith we're pulling in a lot of concepts
here is
necessary during this time because a lot
of people aren't
okay or comfortable with
this uncertainty right it's like why
don't i have a replicable why can't i
get this result right now i want this
result right now i'm so used to this
instant gratification and all this other
 i need it now that's not gonna
happen you need to surrender have faith
trust the process and allow this the
time that it needs in order to manifest
or in order for you to just test enough
things and gain enough awareness and
clarity to make it work because that
then presents us with two options it's
either
i feel uncomfortable now this isn't
gonna work you know all these limiting
beliefs come into your mind during this
testing process this experimentation
process in the unknown exploring the
unknown it brings a lot of uncertainty
and the emotions that can come from that
and if you aren't able to navigate those
emotions and approach them mindfully
then
the only next option
is i'm gonna go back to this certain
lifestyle i need to go back to i need to
get this job that i may not really like
but it's secure it's predictable i need
i need that predictability no you don't
because clarity stems from chaos order
stems from chaos there has there's the
ebb and the flow it's like how it
reflects the highs and the lows the ebbs
and the flows in frequency of
information there's highs there's lows
when you hit a high in life it's almost
inevitably going to go into a low point
of life and the labeling and the
misinterpretation of these periods of
life as positive or negative or good or
bad is really just sense or nonsense or
order and chaos
and you projecting your feelings and
emotions onto those are going to bring
that energy and experience into the now
when you are experiencing those periods
of life so if this part
of the journey makes you anxious or even
bored at times i want to bring back up
mihai chiksetmihai's flow model which
i'll pop up on the screen so if you are
anxious that usually means that you are
trying to tackle something that you
don't have too much clarity on so the
solution to that is self-education it's
learning it's learning learning learning
and applying in real life so you can
gain that awareness that begets the next
step of awareness and now if you are
bored when you are executing
in order to test and actualize this
vision if you're bored it usually means
that you're doing something that you are
too skilled for there's no challenge
there
there is no challenge there and so when
you fall out of this uh skill to
challenge ratio it is very hard to be
present because you don't have clarity
right so you need to mold your mind
in a way that allows you to
immerse yourself in the present moment
because of this and tap into that flow
state now with all of this we're going
to go into number five but for all of
this i am assuming that you are
executing on a daily basis you are
applying what you are learning and you
are actively working towards actualizing
this vision right because now we have
experience vision goals process and
number five is drive it's the intrinsic
drive not extrinsic drive and motivation
not things that are fickle and have no
meaning to you and are just there for a
quick dopamine hit in order to get
something done no this is a sustainable
and powerful way
of fueling your daily actions and making
those actions seamless right so i want
to bring up stephen cutler's five
intrinsic drivers which are curiosity
passion purpose autonomy and mastery at
the very beginning these are going to be
curiosity passion and purpose so i've
noticed this quite a bit one because all
of these bake in inspiration when i'm
reading something that i'm genuinely
curious about or when i'm doing things
that i want to do with my time
then
i mean you can't beat that energy right
when you're reading a book and you're
like oh my god that makes sense that it
man that's so good and you're kind of
living off of that energy
you use that to fuel your daily action
so what i do and you can go back to my
three habit morning routine video is
where i walk outside in the sun
and i come and i do my creative my
creative habit which is a free challenge
link in the description it's called
seven days to genius ideas it helps you
become more creative
and
then i get straight into focused work
because i have that inspiration i'm
remembering my why for certain things i
have purpose behind my action and that's
what allows things to flow and it's a
constant flow in my day
where in the afternoons i'm also
consuming information in alignment with
my curiosity and i'm making the
connections the passion is found at
those intersections i'm making the
connections it's it has a i have a
purpose behind what i'm actually doing
a big problem that i'm solving and
intentional about solving that will help
me get towards my vision for the future
that my curiosities and learning allow
me to solve better and give me more
clarity on that i'm feeding off of the
clarity that i have in order to gain
more clarity
for something that is bigger now number
six
is to
control your attention
and learn how to focus or at least
understand focus so
this will be a future video 100 without
a doubt um it's outlined so i can tie my
experiences back to it but
i'm going to throw up one more graph and
as you can see this video as a whole is
very foundational and it kind of pulls
everything into one and it's very
difficult to explain all of it at once
but i'm doing my best i hope you are
enjoying this but the graph
it's called the focus matrix so there is
deep focus which can also be narrow
focus
or convergent focus
and then that's at the top at the bottom
there's wide focus or open focus or
divergent focus and then on the left
there's unconscious on the right there's
conscious and all of these contain
this is kind of like a mental model or
something that you can
remind yourself of when you're feeling
stressed anxious reactive you can see
where your focus is going right are you
unconscious and in a state of convergent
focus where you're just focused on that
one negative thing in your head and it's
it's pulling that present experience or
it's pulling that experience and the
emotions and feelings related with to it
and then now right how can you use this
graph to become aware of how your focus
is being placed and then how can you
start to focus your attention on the
more conscious
and the more conscious side how can you
move your focus from conscious
unconscious to conscious and move it
from narrow
or wide or convergent or divergent in
order to effectively
use in the situation that you are in and
the things that you were doing at this
very present moment now this also leads
into my theory and a huge part of the
book i'm writing the art of focus
is that
focus
and attention is how you tap into and
channel and make a connection or kind of
tune into the frequency
of energy that you are you have
available to you right and this again
brings back the concept of awareness
begets awareness if you are unaware of
something of an energy or a frequency
that you can tap into
and bring that into your present
experience
then
like you have to gain that awareness
because the only thing you have
available to your current mind
are the things that you were made aware
of right so all of these if we bring
back up the creation pyramid graphic you
can see the things on the side where if
your focus goes to your vision you can
tap into that energy source if your
focus goes to your goals or
your micro visions per se you can tap
into the experience of those the
experience that think those things
present and then same thing with the
process and same thing with the drive so
the intrinsic drivers can you focus on
your why
right if you remember your why and you
focus on it that is going to bring you
the energy and experience
that is associated with those things can
you see
how powerful this creation pyramid can
be in your day-to-day life you can quite
literally
manage and manipulate and
control your attention to lead and
create a better reality for yourself and
the other thing when in doubt you can
always bring your attention to the
present moment that will widen or open
or diverge
your
focus where uh kind of but if you focus
on the breath you're becoming more
present you're allowing thoughts to pass
it's kind of like meditation in a sense
when you're on a walk and you're
listening intensely to an audiobook or
your focus is divergent and you're kind
of just like you have that spatial
awareness
of
your present conscious bubble that you
are residing in now let's take the
example uh that i've used before in a
few posts
um but we're going to talk about money
for a bit and when i say this i'm
talking about the vision here let's just
paint the vision let's walk down the
thing
uh the vision for the future is creative
work making six figures and the
experience associated with that is like
i just feel good deep in the flow state
and being able to spend
a majority of my time doing creative
work and having a great time and the
positive emotions related to that now
the goals the 10-year goal let's say
is
a million dollars
right and you can tap into that but we
don't have to make it super serious
right now we're just breaking it down
for the sake of clarity so let's say a
million
a million dollars in
a million dollars a year in 10 years
and now let's break it down even further
so one year goal would be six figures
right
so when your goal is six figures you can
imagine your life and how it would look
and feel and how the experience would be
when you are making six figures what can
you afford what can you outsource how
can you free up time on your hands what
does that lead to and now breaking that
down even further six figures is like
four clients a month at 22.50 if i
remember that number right but that's
four clients
so with that becomes much more tangible
to us we become we become very clear on
how we can start to actualize this
vision if we only need four clients at
22.50 or you need 84 sales of a 99
project product
99 product 84 sales
um a day i believe oh a month so you
need
i don't know something like that
there you can break it down and do the
math for yourself but there are ways
that you can break this down and make it
tangible for you whether and that's a
one-year goal that's a one-year goal you
have a lot of time to start to actualize
this and you can break it down into
monthly goals so okay i'm going to land
my first client this month or a weekly
goal i'm going to send five dms let's
start small i'm going to send five dms
or cold outreach messages right that's
how you land clients at first
uh or you're going to study and learn
how other people land clients so you can
land that first client remember if this
makes you anxious in the flow model then
you need to self-educate if you don't
know how to land a client and it's like
oh i'm so anxious about landing a client
then self-educate and learn by a course
by like just scour the internet for all
of the information you can use to get
that first client and now if you want to
go the product route well you either
need paid ads or you need an audience
and if you aren't aware of these things
then you need to start to self-educate
but let's say
in order to build an audience so you
have traffic that you can send to a
product then you need to write let's say
three tweets a day and you need to
engage with 10 people a day so you get
eyeballs on your profile or you need to
network correctly in order to get people
to share
your content so you can grow off of
their audience because they have
eyeballs that can be sent to your offer
and then once you have enough followers
or enough of a distribution network then
you can start to promote once a day and
you can start to test and observe and
see how that's doing and actualize the
vision of your conversion rate per se
now i want to bring up a phrase and a
tweet that i wrote that a lot of people
liked they like this phrase and maybe
it'll help you
understand where you can use this
creation pyramid so here's the tweet
put in the physical mental spiritual and
financial reps become
multi-dimensionally jacked so whether
you're starting a new project that will
lead to more freedom and money for you
or if you are looking for a relationship
and figuring out how to navigate
everything that comes with that
and or if you're just looking for a
better life in general or you're looking
to create a better video and you create
a vision and an outline and goals and
what you need to actually do
and act on in order to create this video
then use the creation pyramid for that
so at the beginning of this video i said
that the ability to order consciousness
in yourself
and in others
is the greatest skill of the 21st
century now why do i say that because
communication
if you can give someone else clarity on
something
on either a vision that they want to
actualize or the goals to get there or
something that just breaks them out and
wakes them up
to
fulfilling their full potential
that is what we do and we do it at scale
online that is what i'm doing here if
you haven't noticed i'm giving you guys
some kind of vision and goals in order
to
reap the experience that comes with that
vision so your ability to do that online
and for the creators and personal brands
and solopreneurs just entrepreneurs in
general that follow me
you need to start to think of all of
this everything i say from a personal
level and a collective level right as a
society we have a vision we have goals
political leaders they have a vision for
their campaign and they give you goals
on how to actualize it your brand
your personal brand or if you have an
e-commerce brand or if you have some
kind of business
this is what you are doing with all of
the tactics that people are giving you
all of the tricks and the hacks in
reality they're telling you create a
vision for your brand
right what are you helping people work
towards what intention are you giving
them what are the goals to get there how
does that reflect in your content and in
your products how is it going to help
them actualize that vision for
your
products as a whole what is the desired
outcome what is the vision what are the
goals to get there how are you going to
make that so seamless for them to make
that behavior change in order to get
that result
right this is how you create
anything this is creation as a whole not
only are you creating better life for
you but you're creating a better life
for someone else when you start to think
of things in this way from vision to
gaining clarity on that vision and
actually
bringing that vision to life so the next
time you feel lost in any dimension
whether it be finances mental health
physical health
health in general relationships
any anything spiritual dimension
the
animal dimension i don't know anything
refer to this
come back and use this creation pyramid
to gain clarity on the life or the
situation or the experience that you
want to create for yourself
and with all of that that is it for this
