the harsh reality is that how you spend
your 20s will make or break your future
of course there are outliers but for the
vast majority of people this holds true
dopamine and modern Comforts have become
so normal that 99 of the population is
docile just way too comfortable and
heavily risk averse the solution is
simple so here are three steps to Future
proofing Yourself by the time you turn
30 life hits you like a truck it is not
hard to observe this fact in society
your time dries up and your habits
compound they're much harder to break if
you didn't take care of your health it
will catch up to you and you will lose
more time if you didn't start a business
you need more effort to get out of a job
it will take longer to get out your
mental Peak starts to decline in your
30s you don't have the knowledge and
experience that comes from forging your
own path people miss out on that one a
lot I'm 26 I can only speak so much here
right uh I'm not 30 yet so why am I even
talking about this but I can attest to
the fact that people have told me that I
am more wise than 50 year olds or other
people that don't have the experience
like how much can you actually learn and
know if you just do the same thing every
single day for 50 years of your life and
of course you have commitments so a
house spouse work and possibly children
and again this isn't the case for
everyone and if you are in your 30s
don't let this discourage you right face
reality you will have to put in more
effort for a longer period of time than
a 20 year old would have to it is what
it is start doing it now but being young
presents the most traps so their social
conditioning in other words you may not
even realize the Trap that you've dug
yourself into by the time you're 25 26
27 you may not have watched a video like
this or some other video of people
trying to make you aware of the life you
have not lived yet your life and another
trap is of course the dopamine Latin
entertainment the stuff that we
naturally gravitate towards right when
you're bored where does your attention
go it goes to your phone you open up
Instagram you don't even know it five
minutes later you're just scrolling and
you're watching some random reel and
then of course there is Comforts new
modern Comforts like video games Netflix
and just other things that cross over
with the dopamine cheap entertainment
that make people not want to Branch into
the unknown and discover new things and
find new opportunities for themselves
and become aware of their potential so
thankfully the solution is simple but
not easy the first step is to build your
body most successful people that I've
talked to have always started with some
form of exercise right I started in the
gym that was my first Obsession I did it
for vanity reasons I wanted to get
jacked I wanted to look good so I could
get women and that's what almost every
single at least dude that I know started
with that are now business people and
and vastly successful in more areas than
just good looks because the gym
specifically teaches you that you have
to put effort into reality in order to
get something out it teaches you that
you are not entitled to [ __ ] anything
the gym is literally the opposite of
cheap dopamine it is Meaningful dopamine
that you see through progress effort
hard work and you get results because of
it and so the other thing is that looks
matter whether you think it's fair or
not right I know there are people that
are less fortunate uh they have there's
genetic outliers there's other things
like that do what you can but for people
that are fortunate to be able to improve
their looks to the absolute maximum why
are you not doing that it's the same
thing with business right attention
grabbing attention is the first step to
being able to display your value right
so you have to catch attention with
content in order to convert into money
in the real world you have to catch
attention with your looks your demeanor
how you present yourself to the world
and then that's when they discover who
you are and your skill set and other
things and if you don't look good you're
taking a big chunk away from what can
introduce you to new opportunities in
the world people just respect you more
when you look good and you've put effort
into your body regardless of if you're
still objectively ugly right if you
don't look good but you've put effort
into building yourself up people
recognize that you attract more
attention from high level people and of
course there is a line where vanity can
hurt your self-image right you can get
trapped in that mental thought Loop but
that's just an aspect of living with
purpose and that can be learned and
overcome through a mindfulness practice
right when you're pursuing anything
whether it be looks money whatever
there's also there's always something
you can compare yourself to when you're
moving forward and making progress in
the world that is where suffering is
born out of desire and so you need to
learn to manage that it doesn't mean you
just avoid it completely and not expose
yourself to experience through actually
moving through the world and making
progress you have to do both peace and
progress practice both skills and lastly
you can look good and not be a
narcissistic [ __ ] and we start with
building the body because you can start
right now you don't have to wait until
oh I have this certain skill set in
order to make income from my business no
you go to the gym right [ __ ] now and
the benefits of it transfer over into
clear thinking a strong mindset and just
more physical energy when you prioritize
your body your mind and finances follow
because you're improving the vessel from
which those things come so the second
thing after building your body is to
build your mind your level of Mind
dictates your quality of life right your
level of mind is pretty much your
perspective how high and open of a
perspective you have from which you
interpret the problems in your life if
you have a low level of mind and you are
focused on a problem within that level
of mind like paying the bills and Oh no
you're trapped in this mental thought
Loop and then you don't learn the skills
and gain the experience necessary to
increase above that to view the problem
from a lens that does not bother you
right because your problems don't go
away you just get better at perceiving
them and with this you don't need to
understand every single part of a nice
car in order to have a nice ride but
with the mind it doesn't work like that
you have to understand your mind in
order to use it and in order to drive it
and that alone will dictate the quality
of your Human Experience in and of
itself so schedule time to study
philosophy study spirituality study
metaphysics study psychology study
epistemology study stages of ego
development study spiral Dynamics study
the mind this is a lifelong pursuit of
Mastery you will become powerful so on
top of that we need to use our mind to
make progress in reality so we adapt to
the modern landscape by creating a
vision for your future deconstructing it
into goals acquiring Knowledge and
Skills and making small daily
improvements focus on your health wealth
and happiness I also have a video called
society as a pyramid scheme how to take
back control of your life something like
that but that's a great video for
breaking that process down more now step
number three we built our body we're
building our mind build your business
that's step three entrepreneurship is
for everyone I just went on an entire
10-minute rant in the last video so go
watch that and I can handle objections
all day about this but entrepreneurship
is for everyone you are an entrepreneur
right now you have value to provide and
you provide it to some people all you
need to do is put that value on the
Internet or in front of people with a
price tag on it and boom you're an
entrepreneur strip your mind of the
limiting beliefs of what you think
entrepreneurship is and just start
contributing to humanity and getting
paid for doing so that's
entrepreneurship by helping other people
so business is how you Channel your
interests skills and expertise to impact
others at scale and as Alan Watts would
say sensible people get paid for doing
what they enjoy doing and if you want to
live a fulfilling life you need to
leverage all five intrinsic drivers
curiosity purpose passion autonomy and
Mastery you need to create and have full
control over the lifestyle you wish to
live business is how you get there and
no you don't need to start a billion
dollar company the internet has leveled
the playing field for skill and
knowledge acquisition and just being
able to build a product and put it in
front of someone Evolution has led to
this point of Us coming full circle to
how our ancestors were entrepreneurs and
we're just you just
all work in your little community and
it's like a little Utopia that you live
in and now it's much more larger scale
and Global so you don't need a one
billion dollar company you need a
one-person business you need a specific
set of skills that you learn the ones
that you want to learn you generate
traffic on social media by putting
yourself in public as a personal brand
and it's as simple as this you create a
product that would have helped your
former self right
or
would have helped you get to where you
are faster because personal development
is about solving your own problems
business is about solving other people's
problems so if you solve your own
problems and you create something to
help you with that like a planner if I
need mental Clarity I'm going to create
a plan or a journal and then I'm just
going to sell that to others set a goal
find a problem learn how to solve it
document how you solved it distill it
into a replicable process give it to
others that want to be helped do it
offline and it's called growth do it
online and it's called business that's
it so in your 20s to make the most of
them you realize your potential by
becoming aware of the rut that you were
digging yourself in just by the default
state of humanity that's how you're born
where your Consciousness is chaotic
unless we order it don't waste your 20s
build your body build your mind build
your business and like comment subscribe
