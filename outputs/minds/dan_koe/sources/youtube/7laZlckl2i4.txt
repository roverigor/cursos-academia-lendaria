justin welsh my man welcome to the show
how are you doing today
i'm doing great dan so uh it's really
good to be here man glad glad that you
and i are getting a chance to catch up
and chat with one another
yeah i'm excited you do something very
unique i mean i'm a twitter guy kind of
exploring instagram now and as you said
before we even started this a lot of
twitter people like to on linkedin
and i was one of those people because i
used to think of it as like oh this is
for recruiting for a job or trying to
find jobs and
other things of that nature which we
will dive into
but i have a question that i ask
everyone that comes on this podcast it's
the very first question
and that question is
what is your life philosophy
in one sentence
in one sentence um
to do what i want with whom i want
whenever i want
that is my life philosophy
you're on it that it's it goes both ways
it's like people either know or they
think about it and then it comes out
to something similar it's all it's all
related to growth like i can kind of
sense what everyone's going after now
especially with the people that have
seen
uh some form of success or autonomy
or have gained that personal sovereignty
that everyone's after and that's really
it so
with that how
how did you make that realization
yeah i made that realization through
um
kind of going through this painful
journey
which was um for those of folks who
aren't familiar with me my my past life
is i'm an executive operator i was chief
revenue officer at a sas company uh
prior to that i worked for another sas
company that was a unicorn for five
years i was an early employee there and
after 10 years in really high growth sas
companies zocdoc and patientpop i came
crashing down
burned out really badly especially the
executive part when i took my first
executive role i was 33 i was a stretch
hire thought i'd get the company to a
million maybe two got it to about 51
million and as it got bigger and bigger
and bigger i lost control and
burnout is about loss of control it's
not about working hard i can work hard
all day
but losing control is is what starts to
really cause burnout and in late 2018 in
december um i was
really heavy i was drinking too much
eating too much not getting enough sleep
and i had a panic attack
and um i literally thought i was dying
like no joke my wife had to call the
emts 9-1-1 they all came to the house um
it was really really bad and
uh after that happened that january
about maybe two weeks later i let my
co-ceos know that i would be stepping
down from my role and i stayed for
another eight months got myself into
shape uh stopped drinking so heavily
slept more but but that was the sort of
the thing that needed to happen
in order for me to look at my life
through a different lens if that makes
sense
wow that makes a lot of sense and i
can't i can't resonate with the whole
executive position but in terms of
in terms of like alcohol and bad habits
that stack up over time
that is one thing that i can heavily
resonate with right now because i'm a
i'm a young guy and i went to college i
had my time partying partying and
i made this realization recently where i
was trying to justify my alcohol
consumption
and it was
not a lot by any means right it was
maybe once every two weeks
just on the weekend
and man when
i say just like stopping that alone
it does give you
more of that sense of control because
like the brain fog and other things can
last like up to a week and you're just
not making the progress that you could
so in terms of regaining control
was did you do anything before leaving
the job to start
on that path
yeah i i for 90 days i went alcohol free
um
that was that was a huge thing for me to
kind of reset my balance and
less less because like i like to chug
alcohol right but more more more because
it was a coping mechanism for the stress
that i felt uh at my job and so i
thought i thought all right i've already
made the decision to leave the company i
had great great ceos at my last business
and still still really close to them to
today so i made this decision to like
clear my head which then ultimately
allowed me to eat better i eat better
when i'm not drinking alcohol or i'd
make better food choices sleep better
right naturally sleep not in the
beginning but it starts to come you know
much better much cleaner and then one
thing that i did i have two back
surgeries um so i can't do a whole lot
of lifting or running those are kind of
all off the table for me so my wife and
i started walking 10 miles a day so we
lived in la at the time and the square
around our house was 1.1 miles and so we
did three in the morning three after
lunch and three after dinner and with no
alcohol healthy food a lot of sleep and
walking 10 miles a day i lost like 40
pounds and i just got clear
and it was a perfect time for me to get
clear because i was going out on my own
and i needed to be as clear as possible
yeah
i read that in one of your tweets and i
was gonna save that for later because i
am also a
fellow walk enjoyer i go on like five
six blocks a day they're not that long
um
but you mentioned that you
like a business idea popped into your
head and we don't have to dive into this
business idea sure but
in terms of walking would you now
consider that crucial not in terms of
your health but in terms of like idea
generation and just being able to
perform well during
your business
doings
100
yeah yeah it's um
it's interesting much like eating and
drinking
i'm a binary person
so like i'm usually zero or one like
and with work
i'm not too much not too different so
if you sit me in front of the computer i
will sit in front of the computer all
day and i will be on twitter be on
linkedin
writing blog posts fixing my website
changing processes doing anything that i
can do i feel like every moment of the
day where i'm not working on my business
is a wasted moment which is a problem
and so
um walking gets me away from that and so
we do phoneless walks my my wife and i
are she'll take hers because she's not
uh loving technology the same way that i
do
and to me it's just like clear time
right it's clear time with my wife which
is awesome um it's really good time for
me to think and when i walk a lot of
times i throw all the things that i'm
struggling with out into the space for
my wife to hear and she's like really
good at bringing a complete we're very
different people bringing a very
different approach uh to solving those
challenges and like a lot of times when
i get back home i have i have a problem
solved or at least i'm moving in the
right direction and therefore when i get
back on the computer or start working on
the business again
i'm i have much more clarity on solving
that problem so yeah walks to me
extremely important
yeah that's awesome so when you are on
the walk
do you have
how do i put this like a specific
mindful process that you go through i'll
give i'll give you an example so
um like i try to be as
present as possible like breathing
not focusing too much on the business
stuff and that can get kind of difficult
right so is there like a conscious
practice that you have to keep your mind
off of the business stuff
yeah it's that's a great question i
don't know that it's a conscious
practice that i have
but if i think about our walks together
they generally follow a pretty similar
pattern to one another which is
usually it's time my wife likes to tell
me a lot about her business as well
and
you might find this this might resonate
with you or maybe it won't but when she
tells me about her business challenges
the the answers become really obvious to
me and i'm like oh that's really simple
i would fix it this way one two and
three and then i realized after after
going through that that her problem
isn't too dissimilar from one that i'm
facing but i overcomplicate my own
solutions rather than being simplistic
in nature like i am when thinking
through her solutions so once i've
actually helped her solve a problem i'm
like oh that applies to my problem as
well and therefore it's like two birds
one stone which has been really really
helpful um so our walks kind of start
off
talking about her business and they
generally morph into chatting about my
business outside of that we talk a lot
about
travel right so like 30 we we walk about
90 minutes i'd say 45 minutes that walk
is just like where do we want to go next
why do we want to go there what do we
want to discover so it's quasi work and
quasi play but but it's definitely a
great opportunity for me to get my eyes
off the computer
right i can i resonate with that a lot
and
i'm going to start making that like
connection myself because i don't make
that connection when i'm actually
talking to people or giving advice
because i've read
a tweet or some piece of content at some
point where it's like
i am great at marketing other people's
business but when it comes to marketing
my own business i suck because you just
overthink it too much you over
complicate what's actually going into it
but then if someone comes to you with
advice it's like oh yeah easy this this
and this and so that's it's a cool
thing to make that connection
but
now i want to talk about
how you balance that because a lot of
people will hear this i'm assuming
and they'll think 90 minute walks like
that's a long time to be away from the
computer and away from work
so
first let's start with what does your
daily schedule overall look like
yeah it's it's pretty similar every day
which like there's proponents for
randomness and there's proponents for
like you know structure i'm probably i
lean more towards the structural side
and so my days are pretty pretty simple
i get up at about six o'clock
and drink coffee
it's my favorite time of the day with my
wife is we spend an hour and 15 minutes
drinking coffee talking to each other
catching up we have a nice outdoor patio
and
screened in patio that we love to sit on
um 7 15 is when i post content each
morning on linkedin which is the
platform that a lot of people probably
have seen me on i'm pretty new to
twitter although figuring it out and
enjoying it a lot
but i post on linkedin at 7 15 in the
morning central time and i set aside 45
minutes for engagement to chat with
people answer comments so on and so
forth uh at the end of that we'll do one
of two things we'll we'll get ready and
we'll go for a walk we do six miles here
at a local park called shelby park or we
go to our gym in east nashville here and
we spend usually 60 minutes on i'll do
the elliptical machine because my back
come home
generally i will write for about an hour
and a half so i try and write an hour
and a half every single day have lunch
and then tuesday wednesday thursday my
after afternoons are reserved for my
advising clients i advise early stage
smb sas companies and so i usually have
some meetings with with customers
tuesday wednesday thursday outside of
that monday and friday i'm working on
business systems so i'm trying to you
know eliminate automate delegate pretty
pretty simple following that that
pattern trying to understand what's
taking a lot of my time that i don't
like doing and that doesn't give me
energy trying to do more things that do
give me energy that's a pretty like
overarching look at my week
nice i like the the last summary of that
doing things that give you more energy
and taking away the things that don't
so because that's a that's a big thing
of mine too
and
i'm gonna try that because recently i've
noticed and i'm talking about like early
in the morning where you kind of take it
easy you you have that hour where it's
like you have your coffee
you possibly get warmed up for the day
like you get ready to go and
i've been the type of guy where it's
like
i just have to go in the morning and and
not that i want to but it's like i get
up at 5 36 and it's like okay we need to
get the day started right now
and my mind isn't primed for that at all
i've noticed that i'll sit there for an
hour
doing practically nothing just scrolling
social media on my computer and then
it's like okay
now it's time to write or post content
or something when that could probably be
better used just relaxing prepping my
mind for the day and like warming up in
a sense is that has that been a
like trial and error
for you
yeah and and i actually
it's interesting because i i chose that
schedule
just based on sort of just what i've
done historically right like old habits
are hard to break um but i chatted with
my wife the other day about this and
when i'm drinking coffee in the morning
i'm generally at my highest point i'm
like i can think most clearly it towards
2 p.m i'm i'm almost worthless um so
you're catching me two hours two hours
before i'm generally worthless but um
what i would like to do i think and test
out and work towards is
starting to flip that a little bit so
getting up coffee instead of going right
to the gym
um writing
and then
coming to the gym two three in the
afternoon you know when i have some
i'm a little down on energy and kind of
getting ramped back up through through
doing you know some workouts so i'd like
to actually
test that
and see
how the quality of my day goes the
quality of my content what i write how
my business reacts um that that for me
is the next sort of test to see if that
makes a difference
yeah
that's the beauty of all of this right
because i've been doing the same thing
it's like
i've probably i've probably been
self-employed i think it's like
closing in very close to three years now
and
the entire time it's just constant
testing of like okay what's the perfect
schedule for optimizing
my energy throughout the day
and so with that that's just a perk of
self-employment and being able to create
your own structure so with that
you are
the linkedin guy
even on twitter you're the linkedin guy
so let's let's start there
actually let's start before that before
linkedin so we're at the point where you
have quit your executive position
and now before linkedin was there
anything
you tried out was there any shiny object
syndrome or
testing different things before
committing to linkedin
yes and no so the last part of that
sentence changes it a little bit of that
question so
i started with linkedin that's how i
started in in
most people who are listening to this
who are twitter fans will probably find
that to be an odd choice but think back
to like late 2018 as i had this sort of
panic attack and i knew that i was gonna
go out on my own the first thing that i
thought was i needed some attention like
i just knew that attention would be a
good thing and so i didn't know how to
get any i'm a sales leader so i know how
to sell myself really well but i don't
actually know how to go out and like do
distribution or back then i didn't know
how so one of the guys who worked for me
was named kevin dorsey and he had been
writing on linkedin and he was a thought
leader in the sales space and because he
was doing that i was just like oh i'll
do the same i'll pick the same platform
twitter to me was news back then i
didn't understand the platform right and
i didn't want to be on video or
instagram you know so i don't have a
six-pack ab so i didn't want to be you
know thrown throwing pics up so i i
chose linkedin and i i started to to
write um but i also tried like some
video video series i tried like long
form blog posts i did all these
interesting like mini webinars all this
stuff to just try and get attention
and then one day i wrote something and
it went it kind of went berserk and it
got like i don't know three or four
million impressions and i was like oh
this is interesting because a i like
this i like to write i and and b like it
seems to be working and so i just from
that moment on i didn't do video i don't
do audio i mean except for for podcasts
and things like this and i just started
writing
every single day and my goal was to be a
better writer
and
it doesn't matter like linkedin is just
you're just typing into a box and
hitting send it doesn't matter if it's
linkedin or twitter like sure they're
different platforms but the practice of
writing every day and shipping and
publishing um was something that allowed
me to start understanding how to create
as much attention for myself as possible
and so that was you know
what now two two and a half was three
years ago and uh you know i've been
writing every day since
beautiful
so when you first started because this
is like the sticking point for everyone
on linkedin is one you you wanted that
attention for the sake of growth and
building authority
how do you get that initial traction
yeah it's a great it's a great question
so first of all there's an opportunity
there right so like everyone knows
twitter as the platform for creators and
everyone knows linkedin you and i were
chatting you know before before we hit
record about how it's like a resume site
and you're like oh i thought it was just
a site for resumes or i thought it was
just a site to share job postings it is
and that's why and that's why writing
content that's good and compelling on a
platform that's not meant to be used
that way gives you a leg up
and so
for me it was all about how can i show
up and be radically different than
everybody else on this platform and as i
started to look at twitter and i started
to pay attention i was like oh i see how
people are using twitter i'm going to go
use i'm going to go use linkedin just
like people use twitter because nobody
else was doing that i stood out
and
as i started to stand out i started to
just do things that i had done my sales
leadership job analyze the data what's
working what isn't working double down
on what does cut what doesn't and so i
started to learn about formatting right
um being compelling being polarizing i
read every book that i could get my
hands on copywriting i read all the cash
vertizing and ogilvy on advertising and
i read all russell brunson's books on
how to create characters and you know i
just became a student of getting
attention
and i got really good at it and
the interesting thing about getting
attention online is that it's addicting
and anyone who says that it isn't is
full of and so once you once you
get it you want to get more of it and to
get more of it you got to study more and
so that's just sort of been the cycle
that i've gone through is writing
analyzing studying writing again repeat
i did the same thing and i forget about
this all the time cash fertilizing that
brings back memories because now now
people are promoting like different
copywriting books but man like cash
advertising is good like you'll hear
people take the stance where like they
go against advertising but that that
opened up so much room for other
uh
like research like more connections to
be made
and so
with that
one
i encourage everyone to go read cash
vertizing because it'll just lead down
so many different avenues but also
what's what's like the tangible process
for getting those first impressions
because on twitter it's like oh you just
comment under other people's posts or
you tag someone with a value post and
they'll retweet it
so how do you go about that
so
there's there's basically two really
simple ways one is not too dissimilar
from twitter which is
um and i kind of teach this in my course
which is yeah being underneath large
accounts and because linkedin is is run
by microsoft and therefore antiquated
and doesn't roll out very good features
you can't you don't know when i post
like there's no there's no notification
button you can't set a bell or a ding
for my posts and so um what i encourage
people to do is find three to five of
their favorite thought leaders and just
write a message and say when do you post
i don't want to miss it and whenever
they post in the morning or in the
afternoon or whatever get there first
but get there first with value much like
twitter not two not too different than
twitter add something meaningful
underneath their
their post you can grow from a thousand
followers to ten thousand followers just
doing that the second thing is to write
to publish and i give a framework for
for getting started on linkedin and
again this translates pretty well to
twitter you know i'm getting some really
good traction on there after having
posted now for just five weeks um
so my my framework is i start with the
meat and the meat is like what do you
want to teach someone what is the thing
someone should learn from reading this
this post on linkedin it's usually the
numbers that you'll see on a twitter
thread right step one step two step
three it's the meat it's the information
you wanna you wanna display um so i
always write the meat first what's
what's something i wanna teach someone
today how to write well how to build a
business how to build an audience
whatever you want to call it right once
i've written the meet my next thing is
how do i actually want to get people to
stop and read this so i write the hook
which is again it translates well to
twitter first line is the scroll stopper
for me it's how do you get people who
are scrolling on their phone to stop
when they read that very first line the
second line is the validator like okay
i'm validating reading the second line
that it was a good idea for me to stop
after reading the first the first line
and the third line is the hook line
which is getting them to click the see
more button which exists on linkedin but
does not on twitter so if you want to
click see more i've got you right once
you click see more you're now into the
meet you're now reading the information
that's actually valuable and at the end
of the the post i like to do a recap and
a call to conversation so much like
you'll see twitter threads giving you a
tl dr like here's all the things you
just read in a short summary i'll do the
same thing on linkedin so that way if
people want to participate in the
conversation they don't have to go back
up and reread everything they can get
the short nugget right at the bottom and
it's easy for them to participate and
then i'll do a call to conversation you
know what would you add do you agree
disagree calling them into the
engagement section pretty pretty
standard and so if you can follow that
format even as a first-time writer which
is just like hook
meter information recap called a
conversation you're going to grow slowly
if you continue to be con consistent so
really being underneath big accounts and
then having a good structured
you know process for your writing i
think are the two biggest things you can
do early on
right
i like what you i like what you said
there about the the notifications
because now you told everyone when you
when you post so expect more engagement
7 15 am central time every day
nice i'll be in there as well so
with with that have you
changed your process over time and what
i mean by that is
from
beginner let's say 0 to 10k followers to
10k and beyond
what's your linkedin process now
yeah now it's just it's more robust and
it's more systematized so for example um
i used to sit at my screen and look at a
blank you know white screen think what
do i want to write today and that that's
not that's never uh very fun
over time as i started to realize that i
needed ways to ideate rapidly i created
my own system i called it just the
content matrix for lack of a cooler or
better name and what i did was i just
took all of the topics that i normally
like to write about
i listed them on the left hand side i
took all of my favorite structures
observations step-by-step guides how
to's analytical ex first y pass first
present whatever all these different
structures listicles whatever and i kind
of just put those across the top
and then
once a week on saturday morning over
coffee when i'm feeling really energized
i got tons of free time i sit down and i
just pair those things up topic
structure pair pair of pair the idea is
just ideate quickly quickly quickly
quickly so as soon as i put these two
things together an idea merges i write
the headline so i'll write 10 headlines
right away now i've got at least 10
starting points and then i'll use tools
like um
i like i think it's called type form
and there's another there's hype fury
and so i'll just start to plug those
into those tools and use some of the
inspiration and templates that they have
to make sure that i'm writing in a way
that's formatted correctly i'll throw it
into hemingway app hemingway will tell
me if it's grade one grade two grade
three my sentence structure's clear
everything's easy to read and then i i
load it back into hype fury and i try
and create
ten pieces of content sitting down for
two hours and then because i've created
10 pieces of content i might as well put
them everywhere that's relevant and so
not only will i send them to linkedin
but using hype fury i'll send them to
twitter i'll create posts that will go
to instagram
and then i'll put them on my my website
since most of my followers are from
linkedin i sort of use this suction
system where what i'm doing is i'll post
the blog on linkedin to 130 000
followers and 50 000 newsletter
subscribers
and i'll share
a snippet
of the article and then i'll redirect
them to twitter
and i'll pull my linkedin audience to
twitter they'll start liking the tweet
and then it gets exposed to lots of
strangers on twitter who have no idea
who the hell i am
and so i've been using this momentum
trick to kind of take my linkedin
audience bring them to twitter and use
them to expose my content to people who
don't know me
and so that's sort of the system that i
follow on a regular basis
that's smart
i really like
just one from 4 000 to 22 000 followers
in like five weeks
yeah that's insane
man
i'm missing out on the linkedin game i
knew i was gonna have to double down on
it right now but uh
no that's really
that's sweet and you have a lot of power
i've i've
specifically on twitter i'm sure it's on
linkedin too but you've talked about the
amount of impressions you get and this
is all technically organic compared to
paid ads
what are your views on
paid ads
i i've never run a paid ad um
i don't have the competency to like know
how to run an advertisement so uh i'm
not i don't know how to do that which
may sound really silly to people
listening but like i just don't care
i i generally believe that i am more
likely to make sales of my product by
building this massive organic following
by by having people know exactly what i
stand for exactly what i write about
exactly my what my opinions are and
exactly what my products help them do
and
i make most of my products priced at
what i call like an impulse buy pricing
i'm not out there selling 1200 master
classes the amount of trust
that it requires to build in order to
get someone to spend 1200 bucks is
pretty massive most of my stuff
is what i call trust trip wires right so
it's getting people in with a lower cost
product that delivers incredible value
and having them start to say like this
is someone we can trust when i spend
money with justin i know that i'm going
to get significant value from the
product and so i feel like the best way
to do that is to continue to go out and
build an organic following could i do
advertising and maybe have a three to
one return on on my investment maybe i'm
sure there are a million facebook ad
gurus out there who would tell you that
that can happen
it's just not something i've done yet
and
i'm sure some of your listeners will be
like why not and the answer is i just
haven't focused on it i wish i had a
better answer
no i'm this i'm the same exact way like
i
i tried a whole facebook ad agency
a while ago and that was my only
experience with ads ever and after just
like seeing and as you said getting kind
of addicted to the growth on either
platforms it's like why do i
like i don't feel like i really need
this especially right now when this is
working and
it's not really worth splitting focus so
i completely agree with you there but
uh
i guess yeah paid ads they're an option
they're there for certainly people like
us when
we decide to go after them so if i
decide to build yeah if i if i decide to
build a sas platform or a sas company
like
and the prices at the right uh you know
if i can get enough people into good
lifetime value then
sure i'll spend
spend some money and have customer
acquisition costs and if i can justify
that then yeah hell yeah i'll run ads
but someone else will run for me because
i don't know how to do it
exactly
but
with all of this so we talked about
content how you
ideate and come up with all of this
content
this all falls under the umbrella of a
personal brand
so in terms of the personal brand
how first how would you define that
i mean i don't really think about
the i hate the word personal brand i
used to use it a lot when i started like
i wrote guides on how to build a
personal brand so i called it um
i think of myself in this i mean this in
the least arrogant way possible so i
don't i don't mean this in an arrow but
i think of myself as a walking business
i don't think of myself as a personal
brand i'm a person who happens to
know how to solve a lot of people's
challenges i know how to help people
grow their audience on linkedin i know
how to help people build their first
service business i know how to help
people productize service businesses
that they've been successful with i know
how to do those things and so it's not
my personal brand it's my business
and i think that
i have spent the last two years two and
a half years being really really afraid
or uncomfortable to call myself an
entrepreneur because to me entrepreneurs
are people who start sas companies
that's what i think of when i think of
an entrepreneur someone who raises 100
million dollars in capital and for me to
call myself that was just so
uncomfortable and recently i had a
dinner with the former ceo of the first
startup that i was at which is a unicorn
and he said well tell me about what
you're doing and i described it and he
said you're an entrepreneur that's a
business that's a business that scales
like you can scale that business year
over year and i was like oh that's
interesting so for the very first time
two two weeks ago three weeks ago i
started referring to myself as an
entrepreneur rather than as a personal
brand or you know a one-man business and
i had all those different ways to refer
to myself that way other than
entrepreneur and now i feel comfortable
saying that
um
i can relate to that a lot because it's
the same like
one
there's the stigma that an entrepreneur
is someone who builds some form of like
huge company they're very
like out of touch in a sense but then
there's also the stigma of like oh
entrepreneur is
a kind of like cheesy way to put it
in some cases maybe only i've
experienced that but yeah it's
it's it's a weird dynamic there
and
i want to talk about the
what is it the
i lost my train of thought but we'll
dive into yeah
we'll dive into the
promotional aspects of
linkedin and personal brand and
how you go about this because
in in my opinion like the one man
business
it's much more clearly personal it's
much more authentic
and with that comes different ways of
selling things sometimes because as a
business it's like you have to stick to
the brand message you have to stick to
this certain way of saying things so
when it comes to promotions
there
how do you go about promotions on
linkedin
yeah i think about it i i forget i was
having a conversation with a guy named
eddie schleiner who runs a site called
verygoodcopy.com and we were talking
about copywriting and he used this one
word something about curtin language and
it was like you use this language in
your copy to infer that there is
something
magical behind the curtain
and you know the audience needs to pay
to pull that curtain back and see what's
behind it and so i've that's always
stuck with me
and so when i go out and i create
content the first thing that i'm doing
to set up my promotion is i'm proving
expertise like if you look at my
linkedin profile every single thing that
i've written gets a hundred thousand
impressions or more like i can prove
that i know how to build an audience
there the next thing that i can do is i
can prove that i've turned it into
making money i can share screenshots of
how much money in the business makes
just based on linkedin how much my
products make all those different things
that is all just setting the table
that's all table stakes for me like
being an expert having some authority
showing people that you know what you're
doing but then the next thing that i
want to do is i want i want to let my
audience know that the way that i do
those things is really complex
and i can show you the complex systems
that go behind doing those things
but that exists inside my product so the
first thing that i do when i go out to
promote something
is i create
sort of um
a takeaway of what you get
with the outcome so what happens when
you have 130 000 linkedin followers well
you get great job opportunities you get
asked to speak on podcasts like this you
get asked to speak on stage at events
like saster you make money you can sell
products you can be a thought leader you
can win awards like all those things can
happen if you build a big following so
first i set the table and say like
imagine being able to attain all of
these things right
what's the gap between not having them
and having them
growing an audience becoming an expert
and having some authority want to do
that here's a peek behind the curtain
want to peek behind the curtain fully
here's how much it costs right and then
i throw out an impulse buy my product is
150
not necessarily as much of an impulse
buy as my first product at 50
but with a nice 25 or 30 discount it
becomes something that people can easily
pull the trigger on and whenever people
pull the trigger on it i put them into a
funnel where i ask for video
testimonials two weeks later and i have
2 500 students i've got hundreds of
video testimonials that are really
really powerful they all get automated
to my landing page so my conversion rate
continues to increase over time as
people visit there and i just the cycle
continues people buy people video
promote i post about it people go to the
site conversion increases they buy they
video promote and around and around and
around it goes and so that's how i think
about promotion there's no more
complicated system than just
that specific sort of flywheel that i've
created
that's real that's amazing
i'm going to pull i'm going to go back
over this i
i encourage people to
rewind this and go over that because
to me i've always struggled with that
right it's always the
give value give value up front give
value as much as you're told one both to
give value up front in your free content
and even on the landing page etc but
the being able to not give so much away
that makes people
want to try to do it on their own
if that makes sense because then they're
just going to leave her
and they may come back eventually once
they don't have those complex systems
here's something interesting though and
that i i
um
i had a conversation with someone who
has a really massive following on
twitter and i won't share or share who
it is but uh
he and i had a chance to get a coffee
here in nashville
and we agreed on something which is i
can take everything in my product today
that is in the paid product
and if you look at it it has all been
shared for free somewhere somewhere
along the line i have shared
everything that exists inside of it
people don't pay me
for
some new secret even though they believe
they are
they believe they're paying for news
what they're really paying for is
aggregation
they're paying for everything in one
spot they're paying to go from point a
to point b in one hour not to have to
sift through my content for the last two
years and spend a month trying to put it
all together and so i always give freely
every system i figure out everything i
described about siphoning my linkedin
audience and bringing that's all free
you can all read that on my on my
website but when you want to go build
your first linkedin audience
you want to go build your first service
business i've assembled all of that
information in a way that is extremely
digestible and affordable and so people
pull the trigger get a lot of value and
continue to buy from me
um
one one thing dan that i didn't mention
that might be helpful to some people
is outside of creating that flywheel
at the end
there's also an invitation to join my
private community
and i make my private community
subscriptions quarterly so they're
impulse buys again so people can just
join the community they come in 99 bucks
for a quarter
and what i'm creating is my own personal
twitter my own personal linkedin
where as i grow
and as i sell more and create more
products now i can promote them on
twitter i can promote them on linkedin
through my newsletter but i can also go
to 2 000 people who i have as a captive
audience who enjoy my my stuff and drop
a link in a slack channel
that's pretty like that's that's an easy
way to continue to sell future products
from people who are already excited and
so it's all these different sort of
buckets of you know
it's kind of a diversified portfolio of
income if you will in in distribution
yeah i love that i love how you put that
and the the one question i have from
that is why why the quarterly have you
tried the monthly
pricing structure
i haven't um
i started yearly
and
what i found is that yearly really
really screws with your optionality so
like three months in if you don't like
running the community you got nine more
months
right and so
for me i brought it down to quarterly
mostly because i don't want it to be a
hotel
like i want people who want to come in
and stay for a while and so i think if
you give the community 90 days you're
probably going to be really really
pleased with it i think if you come in
for like
14 days and you're like i don't like
this in the first 14 i'm not going to
spend the last 14 and then you'll
probably have a higher churn rate i
could test it out to see what works but
quarterly gives me the right amount of
sort of oomph to get the right people in
but it also gives me optionality where
i'm always three months away from if i
don't like it anymore closing up shop
that makes a lot of sense
i like that i may try that myself and so
i regained my train of thought from when
i lost it and
my question here is
i've been toying with this in my head a
lot and it is like the future of
business
kind of as a whole but where do you
since you are
a one-man operation or a one-man
business and and you see the value in
that do you see things moving more
towards that
i don't know that i see things moving
more towards that i i think i see
and i'll say i'll say something about a
topic that i know very little about i'm
not a web 3 nft crypto guy i'm just not
it's just not something that i
understand very well but like i do see
like daos daos whatever you call them
and and i don't think that's all that
different than what one man or one one
woman businesses will do in the future
you know for example if you look across
twitter i see a lot of people building
product studios so their studios that
create product non-stop and they rely on
people with heavy distribution to go out
and deploy those products to their
audience that's a product studio i want
to create a distribution studio
myself other people who have really
large followings why can't we bundle
together and say hey you want to take a
sas platform to market hey you want to
take an info product to market you want
to take a community to market
collectively we do 500 million
impressions every year like what's that
worth to you
what what are you willing to give away
for that and i think that if one man one
woman business businesses pair together
to to really improve their power then
they can start to own a large percentage
or or even a small percentage of a lot
of businesses and i think that's a
really powerful thing
that is
i have to munch on that as well because
i can't talk too much about this but
like i just love
uh i feel like it is a very big thing
and very accomplishable for
those people that are driven to
do it right to escape whatever
suffering they're in in terms of a job
or something else because that's that's
what a lot of the people that interact
with us and buy our products they want
to do
but then i kind of get caught up in that
mindset of like oh everyone wants to do
this or this is where things are going
to move or there's going to be a massive
push when
in reality i
don't really know all i can do is just
keep
pushing
the message i'm pushing
yeah and and i think what people
often overlook
is
so imagine me right when i when i quit
patient pop built the company from a
sales organization perspective to 50
million from zero right and i could have
gone out and said well look at guys like
mark roberts who built hubspot he built
that to a hundred million from zero
therefore
i am not the expert
because he did something twice that'd be
foolish because a lot of people
struggling to build something to a
million bucks so the reason that i'm
telling you the story is there's
probably a lot of people who listen who
want to do something on their own want
to leave their nine-to-five want to get
started in self-employment who look at
other people and say there's already a
me out there but there isn't
like there's a million guys talking
about audience building building
businesses building on link there's a
million to me right but
all i want is for people
i'm the brand i'm the niche the niche is
me and when the niche is me i don't
compete with anyone else and so i'm
always trying to teach people to like
build a niche of one build something
where people like you because you're
entertaining humorous funny polarizing
be the guy or the girl that people want
to follow there's as long as you're
interesting there can only be one of you
and if you can build that niche of one
you get you know kevin kelly thousand
true fans whatever it is like you got a
walking business there and so
i just hope people don't get discouraged
by seeing that more people are dipping
their toe in the water because it's just
validation it's not it's not competition
i completely agree it means it's working
and it means there's something there
and
the way that i like to put it because
that's a this is a big thing i talk
about a lot in terms of like you being
your own niche
and i
am a big spiritual guy so i i try to and
like philosophical so i spin it in the
way of like your conditioning every
single
uh stimuli external stimuli you've been
exposed to your personality the things
that have built up over time
makes it so nobody can compete with you
if you learn specific skills to market
and sell yourself on the internet and
understand those hard skills of content
creation writing
marketing sales etc
so with that we talked about
that one huge misconception with online
business as a whole
what are other
common misconceptions that people have
when they come to you when it's time to
build
something for themselves
yeah that's a really great question
i i think the the most
common misconception
is that if you have
an appropriate niche
and a product that solves a specific
group's uh group of people's problems
that you're sort of all set
i think
like oh i work with
um
high performance female sales leaders in
the healthcare technology space i help
them become better at their jobs okay
cool i've identified my niche and i'm
really good at that i did that thing for
five years and i know how to do that
thing
knowing the people whose problem you
solve and being able to solve their
problems are are only two pieces of the
pie the other piece of the pie that
you're forgetting is getting that
attention we talked about earlier is
getting those eyeballs making sure that
people know who you are what you do and
why you do it
and so the misconception that i see is
that people don't spend enough time or
don't understand the amount of time you
have to spend copywriting learning how
to be a great podcast host learning how
to host live events on on video if
that's your medium like running a
successful youtube channel
building an instagram following it
doesn't matter if you want to solve a
problem
like if people don't know about you it's
all a moot point and so
to me
one person businesses are mostly about
marketing
and i think that gets greatly overlooked
by a lot of people going into them
that was so well put i
i wish i could put it like that well now
i can
wow because i made that
i unconsciously made that
comparison because we talked about what
you the things you tried and failed at
before
going all in on linkedin and for me it
was it was so many different things and
i didn't realize that the problem there
was
getting my offer in front of people
because as a freelancer the five
different things i tried freelancing
with it's like okay yeah i'm gonna send
10 20 cold emails
and then get discouraged call it a day
and try something else because it's not
working i could have like get people the
greatest results
but if i can't
actually get them the results that it
doesn't matter
so that is that is huge and a big thing
like one thing i'm big on because
once i started learning the marketing
once i picked up cash vertizing once i
let that take me down a huge rabbit hole
of marketing and sales it's like
everything started to click it's like
yes i understand like i can solve this
problem i've
acquired enough skill to
do something for a specific person and
now it's like okay how do i make this
appealing for that person how do i
actually get their attention in
without knowing all of this stuff what
seems like a saturated market
as we talked about before that's not
really the case so that's huge
and
listeners that is very big so pay
attention to the whole marketing side of
things and marketing yourself
and
one thing i do want to talk about as
well
is your
your bios there is a very
minor difference in your twitter bio and
your linkedin bio
one says you are building a portfolio of
one-person businesses to five million in
revenue that's your linkedin bio your
twitter bio
is you're building a portfolio of no
code businesses
to five million what's
what's the reasoning behind that
yeah it's a good observation um
it's the best way to put this
so generally twitter tends to be really
tech heavy so when i say tech heavy like
linkedin has a lot of people who work in
technology that is different than people
who
make a living
creating technology there's two that's a
minor difference in their
no code on linkedin
is not a popular topic
like people aren't talking about no code
like they talk about it on twitter it's
not talked about it's not
there aren't as many solopreneurs on on
on linkedin
there are people who work for other
companies so using the word no code
it's meaningless or or less meaningful
on a platform like linkedin
one-man business
that resonates it's pretty easy it's
easy to understand what it is i'm a
solopreneur right twitter
very focused very tech heavy
in the way that people are building with
technology
and so when i talk about building a
business i want to be very clear that
i'm not an engineer i don't uh build sas
products i build everything with no code
and mostly service businesses that get
productized eventually that's mostly
what i build service business until it's
good enough i understand it well enough
i productize it and then i move on and
build another service business i
productize it that is sort of how i do
do business and i want to make a clear
sort of distinction on each social media
platform so that it resonates with the
common user so that's why i think about
that
nice i like that so what's
in terms of like the the similarity
there
would you
are you
making one man business and no code
business kind of synonymous with each
other
in your eyes
i don't know that i am i i think
it's a good question i don't know i
don't think so i think that no code
businesses can have lots of employees
and i think a one-man business can be
you know can can be someone coding
something back back you know building
piece of software um
for me it's just using jargon or lingo
that is
synonymous with that platform and so
that that's sort of how i chose that um
i think if i started using the word no
code on linkedin people would say what
does that mean
exactly and and we've been following you
for three years like have you changed
are you doing something different
but building a business is pretty simple
to understand a lot of those folks who
follow me on linkedin and by the way i'm
painting with a very broad brush here
this doesn't describe everyone but are
our you know sales development reps
account executives you know they've
worked at sas companies but they don't
spend time looking at no code tools
they've never used zapier before they
don't use notion
it's a very very different audience
whereas twitter
like everyone talks about that at least
everyone that's in my uh you know sort
of feed so it becomes something where i
can blend in but also distinguish myself
and say i am an entrepreneur i do build
businesses but these are the kind of
businesses that i build and therefore
someone doesn't mistake me for you know
the the next
great sas builder
although i may someday
yeah
i love it man so
the
let's go back into like
in terms of like breaking apart the bio
what you're helping people with right so
the the first step for an absolute
beginner
what is the first thing they should do
to start transitioning what's what's
their
what do you recommend as their first
stream of income to build yeah
yeah it's a good question i think
there's something to think about before
you build your first stream of income i
think the first thing that i recommend
people think about is like who do they
like to spend time with
because in my opinion misery doesn't
scale so if you're spending a lot of
time talking to people that you hate
talking to that does not scale so like
who do you like to spend time with okay
whatever that whoever that group of
people is or are um it should be a group
of of people that are behind you in
their journey so if you're i'll use
sales and example if you're a sales
manager
talking to account executives they've
never managed people before they're two
years behind you in their journey and
they want to look they want to learn how
to become a sales manager right so that
is an example of looking behind you
where were you two years ago where were
you three years ago that's a group of
people that hopefully you enjoy talking
to if you do the next thing that you
should do is you should talk to them and
you should understand their problems
right talk to them for free
ask them to jump on a call for 15
minutes what's keeping you from moving
from an account executive into a sales
manager again just kind of using my past
once you understand those challenges you
can very easily create solutions or
hypothesize solutions right i think this
is the way to solve that problem or i
know very specifically that this is a
way to solve that problem
once you do that the thing i recommend
doing is creating a service business i'm
a big fan of service before product and
because i think you learned so much for
your product by first having a service
business so for me that service business
often looks like a simple coaching
business
okay great i'm going to go find 20
account executives who want to be sales
managers i'm going to make it a
no-brainer impulse buy price come spend
an hour with me for 100 bucks okay cool
you just made 2 000 bucks talking to 20
people and you can start to identify
commonalities okay what are the most
common challenges these people have yeah
they all have five challenges but what's
the most common one what's the biggest
one what's the most painful one cool how
do i solve that very specific challenge
you work through with those 20 people
you're going to start to see common
solutions oh each time i do this one
particular thing with all of these 20
people it works right so what does that
become that becomes your product so then
you go build a product you know
how to become a sales manager in three
months at your job right go from point a
to point b in 90 days put that into a
product deliver that product into your
audience and now you can raise your
service rates so instead of a hundred
dollars for an hour now you're 2.50 an
hour someone can't afford your rates you
point them to the product someone
doesn't want to learn the self-guided
product you point them to your rates and
that's just how you build your first two
revenue streams then you can repeat that
right you can do that with another group
of people you like helping the the
potential
is limitless and by the time you're done
you've got five products they're all
impulse buys
you can point people to them on your
content on your email list wherever when
they reach out to you one-on-one you say
go over there buy that product and you
also have five different service
offerings that you have at hopefully a
higher ticket price so that's how i
think about sort of the
going from
who do you want to work with to building
a service business to productizing the
knowledge that you learn by working with
those people
beautiful
that's exactly what almost everyone i've
talked to has done but it's never been
put
that simply
and i've
i've been growing like originally i was
i went the freelancer right freelancer
route right which i still think is
extremely viable
but
i like the consulting route
much much much more like that's what i
eventually transitioned into after i i
started with web design
realized that i was kind of a commodity
had to learn more skills start with
funnels make it specific to a specific
business
and then once i had results there i
could start consulting people on it
especially the people i liked being
around which were creators
other one-man businesses
because they're they're just fun to talk
to
right and so when i could consult them
on these things and they like doing them
things on their own that's one thing
i've noticed about myself it's like i
like to do things on my own rather than
having someone do it for me i would
rather learn from them pay them to teach
me
and then do it myself from a better
point of view so
a lot of different avenues there but i
completely agree with
the service business
so
we're closing in on time and i have one
last question for you
and this can be pertaining to anything
business life whatever
what is the most
potent
piece of advice
that you agree with but you feel like
other people skip over
wow
that's a really good question
um
here's what i think it is
so
i'm a big fan of small risk and so
a lot of people talk about like
don't have a plan b
right
or or go all in on one thing and if you
don't go all in on one thing you're not
committed
i don't know if this is exactly but i
disagree with that so like
my thing is
i love to spread risk out
this i like to invest in my businesses
in the same way that i invest my money
which is diversified and therefore you
know if something happens to one of them
i'm not out of luck
and i think the majority of stuff i read
out there is like go hard or go home go
deep no plan b
if you put all your energy towards one
thing you have the most chance for
success i disagree with all of that
for me it's like i'd rather build 10
50 000 businesses
than one 500 000 business
and
that advice is comes off the back of
people like daniel vasalo who talk a lot
about that on twitter i'm a big fan of
the way that he thinks about small bets
and so that is
the most profound piece of advice that
i've received is is basically reading
some of his earlier twitter stuff as he
was discovering
that for himself
nice i completely agree there so i do
talk about like going all in
but it's it's nuanced in a case where
like i feel like the majority of the
things you do should be diversified but
then when there is that pull
to say like go monk mode on one project
or something similar that's when you go
all in in my opinion you need to focus
in on that one thing
but i love that because i've been
opening up or
making connections regarding those
small risks a lot more
and i've been writing about it a good
amount which helps a lot with
understanding it
so
