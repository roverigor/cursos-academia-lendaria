i was very observant as a child it
seemed like
everywhere i looked every corner i
looked people were unhappy unhappy with
their careers their jobs their spouse
their day-to-day life everything about
their life seemed to cause some form of
complaint in them and now this may have
just been the environment that i was
exposed to but i'm sure a lot of you can
resonate especially with the
negativity bias that
our brains default to we tend to pick up
on the negative things the most and with
that i knew that there had to be a
better way of living i knew
deep down that
that wasn't the default
outcome of everyone's life that
shouldn't be the default outcome of
everyone's life so why would i try to
emulate or follow that path so taking
matters into my own hands
seemed to be the only option personal
responsibility self-education and
everything that involved making my own
decisions became a very big priority of
mine when i was under 20 years old if
everyone was doing something i wanted to
do the opposite if everyone wanted to
retire at 65 i wanted to retire at 30.
if everyone wanted to sit on the couch
and watch tv at night i would either go
to the gym at night or i would
sit in my room and watch youtube videos
that aren't just mindless and they were
educating me on something to increase my
skill set so i didn't get stuck in a low
skill labor job that are consistently
being phased out and the same goes with
watching the news and just staying
keeping up with the kardashians keeping
like staying informed on everything it
wasn't appealing to me instead i wanted
to develop my own skill set i wanted to
read books i wanted to get my
information from
somewhere because i made the connection
that the the information that everyone
is consuming if everyone is consuming
the same information and it's leading to
this specific outcome in life then why
would i consume that specific
information now there was a default path
that i actually looked forward to and
that was going to college everyone tells
you to go to college so
i have my own views on college but i saw
the positives in it i was kind of aware
at a young age that i didn't need to go
to college if i wanted to make some form
of an income i knew that i didn't have i
don't have to rely on anyone and i don't
think anyone should rely on external
circumstances to dictate the outcome of
their future that includes college and
everything else but with the boom of
education on the internet it just became
eventually that's what i supplemented my
learning with but the main reason i went
to college was
to
delay
the time
that i had to avoid getting a nine to
five because that's the exact thing
there again i have nothing against nine
to fives but at the time they were the
bane of my existence i wanted to avoid
them at all costs because it's what
everyone else was doing so as soon as i
stepped foot on the college campus i
knew that the countdown had begun from
the time that i had to work and build a
name for myself and build some form of a
business or
accept my demise once those four years
come to an end and get a nice job on
something that i'm interested in and
whatever it may be that's why i went to
college was to kind of test the waters
and get a formal education or at least
try and learn some things that i was
interested in i never really did it for
the money originally i wanted to go into
neuroscience because every kid wants to
make 300 000 a year
at a job but then that eventually became
less appealing and then it's like oh do
i want to go into engineering do i want
to do this that and i ended up starting
out in business
met a bunch of great people there and
during that time that's when i started
my first
attempt at a business which was a
fitness youtube channel because
all of my time before that was dedicated
to fitness and the gym it was a very big
interest of mine and it just made sense
why would i not turn something that i'm
very passionate about into a business
when i'm quite literally following
following the people
and getting my advice from the people
that do that as a business right that's
a connection that a lot of people don't
make is if you are studying someone that
talks about something that you are
deeply interested in and they are doing
that as a job you may not see
on the front end that it is an actual
business but it is and that means that
you can also do that too
if you have that same level of expertise
as them it's like i was sitting there
thinking
okay these guys i know everything that
these guys are talking about i'm pretty
damn
uh good at all of the i have a lot of
fitness knowledge why would i not start
a youtube channel because i learned it
from someone else because the
information came from someone that's
already doing it okay that's how you
learn things you learn things from
someone else and then you go on to pass
that information on that's intelligent
imitation which we have talked about in
a previous video now a few months after
creating uh 10 000 calorie challenge
videos and general lifting videos some
vlogs other food challenges and things
like that we decided to call it quits we
saw some growth uh we started to
understand social media in general like
how to actually gain followers by let's
say one of the tactics is commenting on
other platforms accounts to kind of
leverage their audience and grow but
eventually we just kind of stopped i did
it with a friend at the time and
it was just taking up too much time so
from that i kind of dropped business for
a bit
and started studying i definitely
partied more i got the college
experience and that was all fun and
great and now around that time
i remember
there's a deeper story to this but
one night
my friends and i we went up to the
parking garage across the street from
our dorms to smoke some wheat because my
roommate had just gotten broken up with
from his girlfriend who lived in utah so
he was down someone told him hey just go
smoke some weed you'll be fine i
remember that quote vividly where he's
like no bro you'll go go smoke some weed
you'll be fine
and so we went up to the parking garage
and we started smoking and then
eventually uh this
bicycle cop showed up behind us and my
friend nick at the time was like
guys
there's there's a cop behind us and
we're like no
we're we're high out of our minds and
it's like no dude don't don't play like
that it's not funny and then i look in
my
uh
rearview mirror and there's a cup
writing down my license plate and so i'm
like oh and so we end up getting
out and he sits us all on the floor
handcuffs us
figures out that it was
the majority of the actual substance and
the paraphernalia that went along with
that was mine and my roommates and so
they took us to the police station they
booked us they took our fingerprints we
didn't stay overnight but that's a long
story short
we ended up going home and i thought we
were fine he like interrogated me for a
while he's trying to get me to tell him
who
gave us the actual weed and
ended up just going home and
then i thought i was in the clear but
then when i went home for the summer to
work my lifeguard job uh thought things
were going great it was completely out
of my mind i didn't even remember it
anymore and i got a letter in the mail
and thank goodness that my parents were
home at the time but i got home from
work i opened the mail got it saw it was
from the court my heart immediately sunk
into my stomach and i opened it and i
was just defeated because it gave me two
options it said you can either pay
or no you can either go to court and try
to defend your case and potentially be
convicted of a felony and as as a
18 19 year old kid that's pretty scary
especially someone who has been like
a
like a scholar not even a scholar but
you know i took my schooling seriously i
took my life seriously at that point so
it
was like very threatening to me and the
second option it gave me was to go to
like a diversion class where you show up
every week they text you around you have
a color that you're assigned and they
text you uh every morning what colors
have to go in and pee in a cup and get
tested for six months and that thing
costs like five to ten thousand dollars
something like that so that's a lot of
money for a college student so overall
neither of those options sounded great
and i was just defeated it's like i'm
screwed i do not know what to do now
and around this time i was following
matt ogus who is a fitness influencer he
was very big in the og fitness days and
he recommended the book the power of now
and as many of you know i recommend this
book time and time again because this is
what this was a catalyst to it all i
believe this is one of the first like
self-help or spirituality books that i
read and
when i read it and since i was in such
that such an emotional rut at the time
like all of the words spoke to me like
that was when i started to understand
the power of spirituality because once i
read that book
and
like dissected it and just like my eyes
were glued to the page
my worries kind of vanished and i'm like
yeah this isn't bad
like i i can deal with this when the
time comes and so after that i kind of
regained my drive and i started creating
youtube videos from my house over the
summer with my phone and so i created
like acne videos i created talking head
videos on self-improvement and
spirituality kind of like elliott holst
where i was in my garage trying to be
like a tough alpha male and give like
this these harsh truth advice
pieces of advice and it it was kind of
funny i wish i still had those videos
but i don't so i've been trying and
failing at this for a long time and
that's a common theme here so in my
sophomore year i
decided to switch things up i'm very big
on
trying everything literally everything
doing everything experiencing everything
and rather than because it's common
advice like oh pick one thing and focus
on that
forever and that's a good advice but not
forever because you need to pick one
thing and focus on it to the point of
where you can accurately determine
whether you are truly interested in that
or not whether you are passionate about
it whatever whether it fuels you whether
you can see yourself doing that for a
long time you can't just spend one day
doing it and expect to be passionate
about it but you can't spend your entire
lifetime doing something that you don't
enjoy so during college i switch majors
over the summer i
switched
different interests when i got to
sophomore year as we're talking about
now i got more into photography right i
bought a camera to help with youtube
videos i stopped doing the youtube
videos again and it was like oh i should
probably do something with this so i
picked up photography i watched some
youtube videos on how to do it and i
just spent my time like walking around
town taking pictures of like the streets
uh landscape photography portrait
photography and the main thing here is i
didn't really care for the photography i
cared a lot about the editing
so
that's what sent me down a rabbit hole
of photoshop and now this also stresses
the importance of why trying different
things are so important because how in
the world could i know that i was very
passionate and interested in editing
as opposed to say photography without
actually diving into photography first
right there are certain things that you
have to try and become exposed to
when
and if you want to find that thing that
you're truly interested in so during
this time i'll throw up some images and
kind of cycle through them where this is
what i created i would spend six to
eight hours in my room just in flow
state listening the music jamming out
creating these images and you can see
them here where they're very surreal and
they were just mashed up composites of
some of my own photos and then stock
photos and i grew to i started posting
these on instagram and i grew
pretty quickly because this also helped
me understand social media and
leveraging other people's audiences to
grow
because there were community pages where
that were they only posted photographers
work right
and if you
use if you tag them or use a hashtag
they would pick from hashtags and people
adding them and
post it to their page of like 300 000 to
a million
followers and if they tag me in that
then it's like oh yeah i'll get some of
these followers so that made sense to me
and that's what i focused on i focused
on high quality content so the images my
edits and getting those in front of
people and that's how i grew that's how
i gain like my first
2 000 followers until common theme here
i
stopped doing the editing and
photography but it taught me very
important skills like design image
composition color theory that
transferred over into everything that
i'm doing now that's one thing that a
lot of people miss is that if you try
and fail and start over you're still
picking up valuable skills because
everything
interconnects so let's go through the
other business models that i failed
along the way because so far we've got
youtube
twice we've got the photography the
digital art and with the digital or i
stopped doing that because i didn't know
how to monetize it if i were to go back
now with my marketing and sales and
course building knowledge i could easily
build a course that teaches other people
how to actually make those composites
and i could
is is that not the dream is that not
what everyone's trying to do here where
i get to do what i love so create these
edits and teach other people how to do
that
and um it's supply and demand it's
interest that's what all of this is
about is doing something
that
impacts my life on a deep level and
makes me happier and teaching other
people how to do that and letting the
people that are interested in doing that
do it through my course and that's how i
earn an income so the next business
model that i felt with was a facebook
ads agency right i was young and i was
looking up on my phone like oh how can i
make six figures online
and i came across this course it was a
decent course i don't think it's up
anymore
it was billy wilson's six-figure agency
course
and
it was good it was a really good course
and it taught me a lot about lead
generation advertising copywriting all
of that fun stuff and i ended up sending
maybe 10 to like 50 cold emails i didn't
close any clients um
ended up giving up on that and just
going into something else and then the
next thing was a drop shipping rave
store like rave clothing because i liked
going to festivals at this time i was
very big into edm and going and having a
good time at a festival and i knew
that target audience like the back of my
hand i knew exactly what people wore to
raves and i knew exactly how they were
promoted because i was so immersed in
the industry that's another business
lesson for you is if you want to be able
to
market accurately to a specific audience
you need to immerse yourself in that
audience i can sell if you want to go if
you don't go to festivals or raves or
whatever it may be and you want to sell
something to those people i have a leg
up on you because i already go i am the
market research at that point so with
the drop shipping that's i took a course
on that as well it helped me understand
branding it helped me up understand how
to set up a store how to actually get
products shipped from china and i used
my facebook ads knowledge from the
previous course to try and sell these
things and i
there's a picture of one of the products
that i sold which was like a bra
and it was all like diamondy and flashy
and i ended up selling nothing as
the the theme with all of this goes
alright so this is where things get
interesting this is where i started with
web design and a lot of you know me
where when i first started my brand
online and actually started growing it
was because i had success with freelance
web design but i failed with it before
so at this time when i started getting
into freelance web design i was living
with
six other guys
in a big like old frat house in the like
near the college in arizona i went to
asu
and
it was just six dudes that i met in the
dorms and everywhere else it was a big
beaten down house
there was an upstairs at downstairs
there was two master bedrooms that
people split down the middle and people
like slept on opposite sides it was it
was a great time uh it was definitely an
experience for a young college kid i
couldn't do that now i would absolutely
hate it now but it was it was an
absolutely fun time
during
this time so
this
was a time where i was close to a junior
in college and i took in no i i don't
know where i was in college at this
point but the timeline's all fuzzy here
because i don't really do this often but
this is when i took an intro to web
development class and i
went to those classes and i learned the
basics of html and css in like the first
two classes but then this is when i
became extremely interested and obsessed
with coding itself i saw so much
opportunity for it because it's like i
can get a job without a degree i don't
have to get like a crazy nine to five or
like a corporate nine to five i can work
and do like creative coding work this
job seems amazing and so
that got me interested very interested
and i would spend my time after school
just taking courses this taught me the
value in self-education more than i
already had that solidified in my head
where i have to be continuously learning
and building projects on my own outside
of school outside of work whatever it
may be there has to be something that i
can dedicate my time to
and that gives me that intrinsic energy
so spent my time after college studying
learning how to code and the beautiful
thing about self-education is that i
learned the entire course's curriculum
the college courses curriculum in like
three weeks just by studying on my own
and i didn't show up to the class at all
and i still got an a so when i think of
it i believe that was my junior or
senior year but i knew that time was
running out it's either i need to make
something work now in order to secure my
future or i'm screwed and i'm gonna end
up like everyone else like i preface
this video with so
now i had a lot of skills under my belt
a lot of skills so i just start i
decided to start uh an ecom brand
e-commerce brand and i ended up starting
two of them so the first one since i was
into web development and i was immersed
again immersed in that market so to say
i knew that market like the back of my
hand i could market to them well and i
knew that developers were very
passionate about their work so i decided
to start a blue light glasses brand and
now
uh
because developers they have they stare
at a screen all day it only makes sense
that a blue light glasses brand would
sell very well to them and so at this
time i had this brilliant idea i called
my dad and i'm like hey dad
what's going on you uh
i have this brilliant idea and it's
gonna make me a millionaire you want to
send me over a few thousand dollars so i
can buy product
and
of course like i i wasn't expecting him
to say yes but he said yes he believed
in me like this was the first time where
someone like i had an argument and i had
an idea that actually made sense
to the point where he would invest in my
business and my dad isn't the wealthiest
man alive a few thousand dollars is a
lot of money to him and it truly meant
the world that he took that chance on me
and so i did everything in my power to
make that work i
ordered the product i made sure it
looked good
i started setting up the store i set up
ads i studied influencer marketing and
this is a picture of my first ad where
you can see the glasses and you can see
um
my hedgehog at the time momo
rest in peace momo he did not make it
and he is not alive today but
long story short i blew that three
thousand dollars and didn't make it work
and in between the long shipping times
for the product to actually get to me
packaging it all up and then trying to
promote and advertise
without much money
it just didn't it didn't work and so now
this taught me the value in building an
audience where
you don't have to rely on shoveling
money into a furnace in order to
actually test things out you have an
audience where you can test ideas via
content and then you can see what they
actually want and then you can create a
product or service for them so this
sparked another major low point like the
time i got arrested and found the power
of now by eckhart tolle but it's like i
just wasted a bunch of money i've tried
all these things like is this actually
gonna work um
like when will it work i have all of
this knowledge i feel like i know quite
a bit uh like why can i not make this
work
and
so that put me into another like
emotional rut in a sense
and it was around this time where
i called my dad i'm like hey
wasted your money
don't know what to tell you and
he pretty much told me like you have
these web development skills like you've
been doing this for a long time there
has to be some kind of job that you can
get now that is more higher paying than
the one you currently have
and so that's when i started applying to
web development jobs and i ended up
getting one at a web design agency and
so now with that money coming in i have
decent money coming in it was like it
was like 60 70 000 a year
and that's a lot of money for a person
that is still in college and that's when
i dropped out because it's like why
would i continue doing this when i'm
making money and i want to spend my time
elsewhere trying to build these
businesses still and so i started in
a wallet brand this was the second
e-commerce brand where i'll throw up
pictures these are the wallets that i
made
um i ordered them i got professional
pictures done i did everything right i
felt like i did everything right but
then when it came time to promote i just
i just didn't do it i
i don't know why i got afraid or
something and i just didn't actually try
and sell the wallets i ended up just
giving up and this is when i started to
go all in on freelancing because i had
some jobs coming to me here and there
because i'd been putting my name out
this entire time and it's like people
knew that i did seo people knew that i
did web design people knew that i did
facebook ads and all this other stuff
and so i had some clients coming to me
here and there but i really narrowed in
on web design and this is not to mention
that i also failed at a content
marketing agency
um an seo agency
and a few other things i just tried
everything right but they all
complemented each other because they go
hand in hand and so
while i was at the web design job i
started to make connections it's like
okay
they have a marketing department
they have a sales department
oh like this is how they actually
deliver the work and keep track of the
products i mean projects and all of this
other stuff and it started to make sense
and i started to form this foundation
for a new freelancing business with
web design so once i had the idea of or
just was committed like okay i have a
lot of expertise in the web design it in
the web design area and so i just
dedicated everything to that my job was
kind of cushy and i had a lot of time at
work to do things so that's when i was
cold emailing people that's when i was
dming people in like facebook groups and
all of the other lead generation uh
methods that people teach you i was
walking into local businesses talking to
people i was seeing like cars where they
advertise their business on the actual
car and i was writing that down in my
notes as i was driving so i could cold
email them later and reach out to them
on facebook
and all this other stuff and i ended up
getting work from friends family and
then like in the referral network and i
closed a few
uh from like cold emails and other
things like that and i started
consistently bringing in like three to
four
like 1500 to 2500 web design deals
consistently and then at this point
i kind of realized that web design
itself it's a very good thing to start
out with but
there you can make it more powerful by
learning offer creation and so this is
when i learned offer creation and
started to tailor a service to a
specific type of business and i chose
service businesses which is something
like pest control
or uh
what would you say accounting
consultancies all of that stuff and i
created a simple
uh funnel for them so instead of a full
website it was a landing page with an
opt-in and then emails on the back end
to sell them and follow up with them to
get them booked as a client
right and i could even i even offered
facebook ads on top of this to kind of
help drive traffic to the landing page
that i gave them but
all of this together during this time
allowed me to pull in my first six
figures while freelancing so this is
when i started growing my brand and my
audience on twitter i had success with
the freelancing
i was charging like 2500 to 5 000 for
that service funnel and possibly ads on
top of it as an upsell and i had a lot
to offer and i saw someone selling a
freelancing product on twitter and
talking about their interests and all
this other stuff and i'm like okay why
why wouldn't i be able to do that that
looks fun and so i spent my time just
like again in monk mode getting obsessed
with creating this ebook and i created a
freelancing ebook that gave people the
basics of freelancing
and then eventually went on to create a
complementary web design product
with that
and but the the first ebook that started
pulling in around 3 000 a month on top
of what i was making with client work
on twitter and so i saw the power in
that i networked i did all the other
stuff all of the stuff that i teach in
modern mastery hq where
uh
youtube video subscribers
youtube subscribers you guys can get
you can join for five dollars using the
link in the description for that but
eventually i created these just
different products that built off of one
of one another and worked into each
other and during this time i was growing
i grew to like 10 000 followers and i
was still landing clients on twitter
because creators and consultants and
other things
are service businesses so i just took my
offer and positioned it towards people
on twitter and grew an audience and
eventually i was able to
create this self-sufficient
audience and content ecosystem that
brought in clients and started making
sales for me and eventually i continued
to pivot
and i started a consulting service and i
eventually hit a hundred thousand and
then i branched out to instagram i hit
200 000 there recently and it's just
been uh two to three years of like
iterating on these products
and seeing a lot of success
because
the main thing is just building an
audience and getting my name out there
to more people right because in real
life and when reaching out to people
with like cold email you're not really
reaching out to a community or a network
of people
your and referrals are still a thing
there but when you have an audience and
you build it to 20
30 50 100k
that's a hundred thousand people that
know exactly what you do
and they can refer people to you
and if you have the funnels in place it
just makes sense you're in full control
of your income over that at that time so
that is my story in a nutshell and how i
got to where i am today uh now my main
offerings are modern mastery the
community and digital economics which is
a cohort and then of course i still do
some consulting on the side for
marketing
for like online service businesses but
mostly like one person service
businesses so like freelancers coaches
creators consultants
and
yeah so i want to end all of this with
seven lessons that i've learned because
this is it's just a story i hope it was
a bit inspirational but i want to teach
you
the seven lessons that i learned along
the way the first one being that
nothing happens
then everything happens or nothing makes
sense and then everything makes sense
because you're going to go through
your when you are
going down this unconventional path
you it's unpredictable there really
there's courses and other things that
can teach you certain aspects of it but
most of it is dependent on your ability
to self-educate and iterate and pivot
and pick up specific knowledge along the
way it's like as we always talk about
when you're exploring the unknown you're
kind of like collecting dots right
you're collecting dots to a point where
you can connect the dots and then once
you connect all of the dots
that's when things take off so that
leads into lesson number two which is
figure it out
stop relying on
the external to give you what you want
if you don't have energy then generate
your own energy with purpose and passion
and pursuing things that you're curious
about if you don't have an income
then
take to
self-educate online and figure out how
to make an income the third is
don't be afraid to start over we talked
about this a bit but starting over on
the unconventional path isn't starting
over
right you're consistently picking up
information that is extremely valuable
and once those dots connect
that's
the when the dots connect of like
starting over and then it creates this
way of doing things that is very unique
to you that other people can't replicate
that is what you're looking for so that
leads into number four which is um
embrace the uncertain and unpredictable
path because nothing worth having is
predictable right a predictable life is
not a
good or meaningful life that means you
are just living out the same actions day
after day after day after day there's
nothing there that can create meaning or
interest in your life like in a story a
story isn't predictable a story is like
okay how's this battle gonna go who's
gonna win this fight who's gonna do this
who's gonna do that how is this story
gonna end up and that's what creates an
interesting life for you if you approach
it from a zoomed out lens or a
sort of meta perspective where you're
able to stay present and view things for
what they are and not go get and not get
so consumed by your emotions lesson
number five is to try everything people
warn against shiny object syndrome but
i've never seen that to be the case you
have to try everything in order to see
what sticks with you right as i said
earlier you can't figure out what you're
actually interested in until you try
something figure out that you're not
interested in it and follow it down
another path that is revealed because
you tried that one thing you have to try
what you are aware of now in order to
expand your awareness into these other
areas that you had no idea existed
before number six is give give give you
are not going to make it in this space
if
you need things if you need the money if
you need
the validation or you need something
external right if you are
thinking about the money the entire time
and you're
like so dependent and fearful of losing
that money or that client you're going
to do worse work people are going to
sense your neediness and you just aren't
going to make it so you need to get in
the habit
at the very start to give out free value
quite literally dm people be like hey
man i saw you were working on this
here's a few tips i wrote up oh here i
built a landing page for you
or just dm people ask them to get on a
call and then help them like give them
advice consult them for free on how to
get something now number seven is shoot
your shot and then shoot again because
there are
i see this way too often especially with
people trying to land clients is they'll
send five to ten dms and they're like
i'm not making any money this is
 i'm not gonna start and i went
through that too
but you have to understand that it's a
game it's
it's a numbers game
and of course like you can
step up your marketing or your sales or
other knowledge in order to make that
more effective but it really is about
just getting in front of the right
people it's about you have your offer
and you have traffic right so as jk
molina says
if your offer sucks then it doesn't
matter how much traffic you send to it
right if you suck as a person
and you're trying to go on dates
and
your offer sucks and you put yourself
where a lot of people are you're not
going to get dates you're not going to
have that happy ending but
if you
make the offer very good and then you
put it into
you have a lot of traffic going to it
then you open yourself up to more luck
right you need people to generate more
luck or increase your chances of luck
than landing that client so when in
doubt build more leverage get your name
in front of more people
network with more people build an
audience develop your skill set
all of the above so that is my story i
