life is a game and your character
determines the outcome your character is
malleable that's the first realization
that you have to make that you can
change no matter how painful or no
matter how much your mind tells you that
you can't no matter how much you want to
cling to the current Comforts of your
life that are causing more destruction
than you think your character is your
concept of self who you think you are an
amalgamation of ideas beliefs
experiences and information you've
process that compose the operating
system from which you interact with
reality for most their character was
created for them every single person
since childhood has been a product of
the environment they were in the
fundamental human Drive is to learn and
that allows us to soak up any and all
information around us that aids in our
survival especially when we know
absolutely nothing and we only have the
drive to survive so with this
information that we gather as children
we are set on the default trajectory for
life because through Evolution Society
has developed to the point that it's at
nobody
I don't like certain aspects of society
right everyone nobody likes every single
aspect of society but who's to say like
who's to say that Mother Nature is wrong
for it being what it is today so it is
what it is and we can work to change
that through conscious choices but we
have gotten to this point in society all
of the societal and cultural information
that your parents learn that passed on
to their parents and then they were
exposed to new societal information and
all of the news and whatever that was
circulating within their time and then
pass that down to their children and
then to you and the cycle goes on as to
you learning how to operate within the
world that you are living in right now
and what blows my mind is that this
could be completely different the point
being is that from this default
trajectory we were sent like a train
hurling down the tracks and if we don't
learn to conduct our own adventure then
we may be heading towards a dead end the
fate of humanity is not guaranteed this
is the case for every every single life
form every single life form is fighting
to survive right and we're all in this
little competition humans may or may not
be on top right now we don't really know
but the thing is is that if we do not
make intelligent and conscious choices
we may eradicate ourselves from the face
of the Earth of course that's the worst
case scenario but it is a possibility
species go extinct all the time because
they are not making conscious decisions
they are not deciding their own fate
they are living by Instinct and so
humans are different but a majority of
the population are living by Instinct
they are living in this narrow-minded
mechanical state of stress robotic
unconscious mindless whatever you want
to label it that is the same exact thing
as animals right so if 95 plus percent
of society is just operating robotically
doing what they're told following the
path that was laid out in front of them
by Society being a slave to their
programming and conditioning like
animals are that 95 is a lot of people
right that is the majority of people
that are the masses that are leading us
off of the cliff and so Society by my
standards is held up by the conscious
individuals it's like they have the
 world on top of them carrying it
towards something better by building
businesses that contribute to humanity
writing creating putting out there
that impacts the lives of others and
wakes them up so the point of this is is
that the character your character the
person that is playing the game of life
is either conscious or unconscious
they're either NPC or they are a main
character that character's actions which
is heavily influenced by their mindless
or mindful unconscious or conscious
state of mind that contributes to
society right every single action you
take makes some small contribution
towards the future whether personal or
Collective or small or large or whatever
you want to say every single action has
impact and so that begs the point that
the ideas beliefs and information that
you hold in your mind at any and all
times and are aware of or not aware of
help contribute to your actions and lead
to that better future and so that was a
long-winded intro to say that we're here
to talk about the art of
self-architecture and how to reinvent
yourself but first let's talk about the
Paradox of personal development so life
is a game that houses infinite games and
there are two macro games that are the
most fruitful the first is the external
game the external game is what you
choose to do with your life it is the
self-generated goals you pursue that
impact Humanity it is your life's work
the thing that you dedicate your time
focus and money to building as a
modality for Value creation and then the
second game is the internal game if your
external Pursuits are not backed by a
philosophical sense of Mastery they will
remain superficial and meaningless for
every goal you pursue outward there is a
lesson you must unlock inward this is
the Paradox of personal development the
higher you push or the further you push
into the world the further you have to
dig into yourself to get to your core
because as you develop yourself right
this
pushing outwards while mending or or
chiseling inwards allows you to increase
your level of mind right so man that
we're moving in all directions here at
each level of the game as you progress
as you reach new goal you have increased
your level of mind to solve the problem
that was standing in the way of reaching
that goal right that's how you unlock
the lesson that life has to offer you as
you're moving forward and exposing
yourself to more experiences and so as
you increase your level of mind you can
view the game from the top down and see
the structure of the game itself right
this is why when you're starting out in
business you have no clue what
you're doing until you start solving
problems until you have all of the
pieces that form the structure of
business itself and then you can
navigate your way within that right so
you give yourself one to two years to
actually accumulate enough experience in
business to learn how to run a business
and do it well and make enough money and
then it just becomes automatic and
seamless a season of internal struggle
is the requirement to reach your next
level of mind when you acquire the skill
or knowledge necessary you reach the
next level of mind that solves the
problem you were facing it's like how I
failed at seven different businesses I
tried everything under the sun I learned
everything I could I tried freelancing
drop shipping agency work e-commerce
Brands all of that with minimal
results and as I like to say nothing
happens then everything happens and
after all of those failures after going
through the mental turmoil that they
brought after crying on the phone to my
dad asking him not to ruin my
life because I borrowed and lost however
many thousand dollars from him to order
product from the e-commerce store it hit
me all at once I'm like oh okay
this skill this skill this skill these
all piece together I can see the
structure now I can see the entire
puzzle the image that the puzzle is
forming and I know how to navigate this
new realm Avalanche called Insight
crashed into my psyche that this isn't
like a singular thing right this is only
to solve the current level that you're
at and reset new level of mind it's a
it's a click click click click click as
you pursue external goals you have to go
through that inner turmoil turmoil you
have to chip away at who you are so that
you can see things for what they are
because right that that makes sense
because who you are is just a
culmination of ideas and beliefs so you
have to shed those beliefs you don't
think of it as this as you are doing it
right this is more of a heuristic but
you chip away at those things you chip
away at who you are so that you can see
reality for what it is and what you are
trying to do and accomplish in the world
so the lesson just on the Paradox of
personal development is that it doesn't
come in an instant you have to fight
with reality and you can't let your
expectations make it seem like the pain
isn't supposed to be there suffering is
a very good thing when you perceive it
that way and that's like side note
that's one thing that I don't like too
much about like Buddhist teachings is
that like the like life is suffering I I
know that's one of their teachings but
people misconstrue that all the time
life is a part of life right you aren't
really trying to get rid of it you're
trying to flow with it and that's what
some Buddhist teachers are saying but
suffering isn't bad it's not not
supposed to be there the path of the
problem solver or value crater is how
you escape the world of replaceability
fall in love with the challenge that
problems present from superficial to
metaphysical and your ideal future will
create itself this is the infinite game
that is a quote from my finally finished
book The manuscript at least the art of
focus which is launching sometime soon
been talking with Publishers been taught
been toying with the idea of
self-published I know what's going to
happen but I can't say it yet because
you never know but once it's solidified
I'm giving updates launch date is sooner
than I expected so I'm stoked
for that to change who you are you must
strike a balance between peace and
progress again we have The Duality here
that must collapse into one we have the
duality of progress pushing outward and
peace
inward nothingness doing and being
because certain goals require a certain
character to be able to even know that
that is a goal and pursue that goal
right it's like in a game you have to be
level 50 to go into whatever dungeon or
accept whatever Quest right you have no
clue that that goal and that potential
for your life even exists right this is
why I'm so big on just like just pick
something just pick something
and do it stop worrying about
all of these little things that
can go wrong they're gonna go wrong good
accept it overcome it because it's like
I I never thought I I thought I was
going to be doing web design my entire
life but no since I accomplished that
goal burn through that Karma outward
inward then I unlock the next level I
understood okay this is what I have to
do and I did that and that's where
people get stuck right because it's like
oh only focus on one thing or find what
you want to do and do it for life you
don't know unless you start doing and
the thing here is is that if you're
pursuing goals you can't neglect the
inner work that is required to reach the
next ones because then you just end up
highly superficial like a businessman
with no health or a bodybuilder with no
philosophy or a pickup artist with no
values the art of self-architecture
Demands holistic development man cannot
remake himself without suffering for he
is both the marble and the sculptor
think of who you are your concept of
self as an intellectual structure that
you have built yourself into over time a
house not a home and when you go to
remodel a house do you go straight for
the foundation no you don't demolish the
entire house at once and and when you
start chiseling when you start making
those small changes when you start
chipping away at the wood or or the
exterior do you just like rip it off or
do you make it small calculated Taps so
that it's seamless and you're able to
piece something back on there perfectly
most people want to start with the Deep
spiritual and metaphysical problems that
reside in their core and if you haven't
done even the slightest bit of self-help
work like going to the gym or training
fixing your new attrition and habits
acquiring high value skills and
knowledge then you're in for a bad time
I would argue that people trying to be
spiritual without doing The Superficial
work in order to reach the inner depths
of yourself are doing it for superficial
reasons they're doing it so that they
can wear it as a status hat they use
spirituality as a nobility card to avoid
making any form of contribution to
humanity by pursuing goals when all a
person's relevant skills are needed to
cope with the challenges of a situation
that person's attention is completely
absorbed by the activity there is no
excess psychic energy left over to
process any information but what the
activity offers all the attention is
concentrated on the relevant stimuli to
quote from mihai Chic set mihai in the
book flow this is the path to maximum
enjoyment in life so here is a process
to follow the first step is to pursue a
goal that is challenging enough start
small and superficial fix your health
finances and mindset one foot into the
the unknown take the first step the only
thing that you have to do on your own
well you have to do a lot more on your
own but the only thing that you can do
on your own I can't grab your foot and
step it out there for you you have to
 do it yourself put one foot in
the unknown so that you can feel the
stress required to continue this gives
you a lesser purpose to actualize right
because people try to as I said earlier
this is synonymous with what I just said
about how people are trying to go deep
and attack their core at first they're
trying to solve their life's purpose
without breaking through the concentric
circles inward from lesser purpose to
Greater purpose to Life's purpose when
you can't even see your life's purpose
you have no clue right so you
have to start with the Lesser purpose
which is just a superficial goal step
two is to acquire the skill necessary to
achieve the goal this is this should be
obvious because it's silly to think that
you can achieve self-generated goals
without self-education you need to
immerse your conscious mind in the
information that will program a new
identity and give you the knowledge to
attack your goals follow social media
accounts that give you specific
information related to your goals people
see this and they're like well I don't
want to follow social media accounts I
don't think you guys understand
how integrated social media is into our
lives and how powerful it is right
people see it as bad like all the news
or toxicity it's like you can curate
your experience but it's an entire it's
it's woven into society at this point
it's necessary it is a part of our Lives
whether you like it or not and after
that after you follow people that are
giving away specific education related
to the goal that you're trying to
achieve you purchase one to three books
on the topic and you devour them when
you have a goal that is top of mind you
begin to perceive situations with
intention intention equals what you are
stretching towards information becomes
more relevant and applicable to your
life and you in the Mindless distraction
and consumption cycle so number three is
to hunt and stack wise or reasons to
cultivate a personal philosophy if you
struggle to act it's because you don't
have a compelling personal and intrinsic
reason to act the first step is
difficult but you must take it then as
you're experiencing life keep an eye out
for reasons you can collect I used to
hate going on walks I didn't see the
point I walk like 20 to 25k steps a day
now I'm not kidding not kidding this is
monthly average steps
eighteen thousand five hundred still
pretty close to twenty thousand that's
monthly average so I'm allowed that and
I'm showing you that because
 in the comments think I
don't walk 20K steps a day I take that
 personally I walk 20 steps a day
and so the the way I got into walking
because I hated them right who who wants
to go and walk out in the Arizona heat
one day I decided to cut some weight
right I I like to lift weights I was
bulking got a bit too heavy and just
didn't want to do cardio right didn't
like cardio and then I read a book or
noticed something online that was
relevant to the goal that I was trying
to perceive it's like if you want to
lose weight just pick up a walking habit
right so I'm like you're right that's a
lot better than cardio there's reason
number one and then so I went on a walk
started just walking around my complex
and then eventually it's like oh okay I
can take calls on a walk so I can do
business on a walk I can write content
on a walk yes you can literally look
down at your phone and walk people will
look at you weird but you can do it and
that's what I do all the time or I can
listen to audio books that's how I just
run through audiobooks and uh like
YouTube lectures right like my friends
are like how do you watch all of these
videos and it's like I just put I have
YouTube premium I put it in my ears and
I walk another thing is that I generate
ideas and for the content that I write
on the walk right I'm just constantly
putting ideas down on my phone because
it's a creativity Block it's where I'm
just blocked out it's not productivity
where I'm actually doing the work it's
creativity where I'm generating ideas
filling my mind and it's a dedicated
time to be creative I don't have any
other distractions there's nothing to
get distracted by and then I stack the
other reason of I just like taking a
break from work I love blocking out like
60 Minutes working going on a walk
coming back and doing those in time
blocks when I'm bored I walk when I lack
creativity I walk when I need to go to
the store I walk I literally just got
back from Whole Foods carrying my things
I walk 20 minutes to Whole Foods walk
back with my groceries I walk to the
coffee shop all the time I just walk and
in that last Point literally influenced
the place where I live right so you're
seeing how your actions start to shape
your future and what you do and the
decisions you make even for something as
simple as just walking and now I don't
think I'll ever live in a non-walkable
city I know all of the Trad red pill
bass dudes are all like oh I want to
live off grid and get a farm and have my
Trad wife and all this stuff it's like
that's great that actually does sound
pretty nice I don't blame you but at the
same time it's like I'm not gonna drive
30 to 60 Minutes to the grocery store or
to actually like have contact with other
human beings doesn't make sense to me I
want to walk and so this does not only
apply to walking but to every single
habit that I've Incorporated in my
lifestyle if you don't know why you are
doing something if you don't have a
reason then why are you doing it right
why are you putting the food in your
mouth and I'm not saying this is bad
we're talking about this more in a week
from now's video but I'm not saying that
like drinking alcohol or watching
Netflix or playing video games is bad
I'm telling you if you don't have a
reason behind those things right
it's fine if you want to if you're
conscious of why you're going out to
drink or play video games or do whatever
if it's to take a break if it's to reset
if it's to gain more creativity for the
week or just have a force low in life
there's no problem with that right the
problem is when you don't notice the
destruction that your habits are causing
and when you're conscious of that and
you allow that bit of Destruction into
your life that's not a bad thing you're
aware of it and you know that you're
going to do the things that will reverse
that and continue to make you progress
so my point here is is that when you
start developing reasons behind your
actions you start to cultivate a
philosophy and for not only those
actions themselves but then they
culminate into a larger life philosophy
that you have for yourself and so step
number four because we gotta we gotta
tie this back to the crater economy is
that turn your valuable Pursuits into
contributions so we live in a time I say
this because as I said earlier social
media is so intertwined with our lives
and how we communicate and the
opportunities available to you as an
individual right because most people
limit themselves to college
opportunities local opportunities other
things like that until they get online
and realize oh
this is infinite social media in this
case is a public forum where you can
share your knowledge online and share
products and services in exchange for
other value right and when I say value
for most people that's money until the
money problem The Superficial money
problem that is a goal for most people
is solved in their lives that's how you
solve it right but then value can really
be anything I can exchange my interests
or expertise for just something that I
want right if I want to if I want to
like go on a vacation I can just be like
I have a million followers
I haven't done this yet I I'm kind of it
feels like weird to do I I don't know if
I'll ever do it but I can like DM a like
a retreat or Resort place and be like
hey what's up like I'll promote you to
my page
um coming to stay and whatever and
they'll be like oh yeah I have a week
for free they actually do that for like
influencers and stuff and the thing with
this is I'm pretty much telling you to
start a business as I always do by
solving your own problems and selling
the solution that you pick up along the
way and your marketing is the intrinsic
philosophy that you form with your
reasons right I could 100 sell a walking
program right 30 days of walks and on
the landing pages all of the reasons I
just listed because I guarantee that
what I just said was somewhat persuasive
and some of you are going to start going
on a walk because of that and so that's
what I'm saying here some someone first
create a 30 days of walks
digital product or just like a book but
that's the most meaningful style of
business model anyways right you're
changing people's lives by changing your
own there there isn't really anything
else that matters at this point like
yeah we can go and explore other planets
but people are doing that out of passion
like musk is doing that out of passion
it's not an absolute necessity for our
species we can evolve and we can
transcend and we can self-actualize by
just doing and solving the meaningful
problems in our lives first we need to
get we need to raise the collective
consciousness of that 90 to 95 of the
masses so that we don't head off a cliff
we came full circle that's the end of
the video I appreciate you
um if you're interested in that business
stuff check out tour writer or digital
economics links in the description
there's also free Power Planner free
seven days to genius ideas challenge the
book is coming soon I look down on my
phone while doing this uh he said the
guy that I'm working with said pre-sale
may start in a month so I'm stoked I'm
so stoked for that dude it's been a long
time coming okay
let's do this see ya
