I've always had the goal of being a deep
free and original thinker but that goal
wasn't always a conscious goal at the
start as the self-actualization process
goes it started as an unconscious goal
it was very shallow I wanted to become a
deep and free thinker
for the sake of others acceptance I
wanted to sound smart intellectual and
deep but I didn't really care about
being a deep thinker I cared about being
accepted by others but in a non-mediocre
way I wanted to be different with time
and after burning through that Karma I
realized that becoming a deep thinker is
more than that it is the key to creative
success or success in any Endeavor in
your life if you want original success
or you want to pave a new way for not
only your own life but a A New Path for
others to follow then you have to
prioritize deep free and original
thinking but before we can understand
what deep thinking actually is we need
to understand the opposite we need to
understand what shallow thinking is
shallow thinking is taking what you see
as law and never seeing beyond your
sensory perceptions or thinking that
what you see is all there is thinking
that a piece of the cosmic puzzle or a
little piece of the cosmic image is all
that there is you see the piece and you
think that's it there's nothing beyond
that there's no depth there's no
connection there's no relationship to
other things there's nowhere else for
your mind to go so it gets stuck there
it gets closed off or closed-minded to
that little thing that you are focused
on and narrow Focus not being able to
see or open your mind to the potential
of other things and that is the problem
I I talk about closed-mindedness so much
because
open-mindedness radical open-mindedness
and being open and critical with your
thinking is extremely important to any
kind of creative work because taking
what you see or perceive with any of
your senses any of your five senses cite
sound taste whatever it may be touch
it doesn't make sense to have complete
and utter faith in that one specific
thing because our sensory perceptions
and how we interpret things are backed
by our conditioning so how we were
raised the environment that we live in
um the context or lens that we are
viewing the world from the goals that
every single individual is pursuing
whether they're conscious of those goals
or not like working a job you are
probably unconsciously pursuing the goal
of your boss and so it doesn't make
sense because everyone is going to
interpret whatever they see in a
different way and then closing your mind
off to that one thing is what sparks
argument that's what sparks uh debates
in the comment section or whatever it
may be it's your inability to see beyond
what is said or heard or seen or
whatever it may be because you also have
to understand that animals a lot of them
have different
perceptions than us they can see
different things than us like dogs for
example can hear different frequencies
that we will never be able to hear frogs
some types of frogs I don't know which
ones but they can see
differently I don't know if it's
different colors but you have to
understand that there may be more colors
out there who the knows and so like
you can see sit and think about this
right practice as we're going through
this entire video deep thinking and just
not taking what you see as law or taking
that diet fad that you see on social
media as the only specific way because
oh I cut out junk food and started the
carnivore diet so the carnivore diet is
the best diet for everyone and it wasn't
because I just cut the bad food out of
my diet so there's no other option and
you can see what there's go where this
goes there's infinite Nuance if it is
speakable then it is infinitely
debatable if you do not open your mind
to seeing Beyond or just holding the
Nuance in your own head with those
things so deep thinking is
becoming aware of the limits your mind
creates because that's all humans do we
create limitations we create
distinctions between two different
things that's how we learn holding
everything you perceive in the realm of
possibility until filtered with direct
experience this is critical thinking
right not taking what you think is law
holding it in your head without labeling
or judging or just attaching to It
Whatever meaning you can you hold it in
the realm of possibility until you come
into direct experience to ground that
information questioning everything
especially the thoughts beliefs and
biases that you think are absolutely
true without exception so in short
close-mindedness is the antagonist to
deep thinking but what is
closed-mindedness it is accepting the
Matrix as your reality yes we're going
to talk about the Matrix because when
most people talk about the Matrix they
think of the movie with Neo and all of
them I've seen it once I don't remember
much from it but you understand that
there there's a red pill and a blue pill
if you take the red pill you break out
of the Matrix you take the blue Pell
you're kind of a slave to it you're just
an NPC a robot and let's dive into this
because the first thing that we have to
understand is that all understanding is
metaphorical
think about that so we get hints of
Truth at what the Matrix is the
metaphorical Matrix that this movie is
trying to point us towards we can
comprehend the essence behind what it's
saying but the notion of the Matrix is a
symbol and you can kind of think about
this and understand that this is not
only applied to the Matrix this applies
to everything symbol now a thing that
represents or stands for something else
especially a material object
representing something abstract since
the beginning of time before we invented
language we interpreted Reality by
recognizing patterns and relationships
we used symbols to represent these
phenomena or the experience or the
essence that came from those aspects of
reality Now understand this a symbol is
a representation it is not what it is it
is a representation of what is it is not
what it is this brings up the whole
concept of being and knowing being is
for first order knowing is second order
you can't know until something is being
or or has come into being so with time
groups of people began to share and
attach meaning to these representations
that gave us a way to communicate but
people had different perspectives on
these things based on their environment
and prior experience meaning that
there is no absolute truth to the
language that we have created right as
we talked about earlier the meaning of
Any Given thing is up to an individual's
perception of that thing it is up to an
individual's interpretation of that
thing so you have to understand that
these symbols or these limits on reality
that we have created are mental
constructions they are mental
interpretations a layer over reality a
limit that our mind has created on
Infinity so with time these mental
constructions have become more advanced
we built on top of them layer after
layer after layer language has advanced
we write books strings of language we
create videos now we've created the
school system the government culture
society and a load of other expectations
assumptions and predictions that we call
beliefs for what life has been and
should be not what it is so think of the
Matrix as a web of expectations that has
been conditioned into our minds ever
everything in this room that I'm in and
the room that you're in has meaning that
has been projected on it from our minds
without any conscious effort because it
has just been repeated to us over time
and we are repetitive beings and so the
neural networks in our brain whatever
it's like the Grand Canyon with water
flowing through it and creating the
grooves in our head so that the water
can flow effortlessly and we project
meaning and accept what we see as law
now there's a trap here where it's like
down so you're just saying nothing
exists and like in essence I am but this
is where the balance of spirituality and
practicality comes into play they
there's a balance there they have to
exist there's polarity I just want you
to see the side of the picture that not
many people see that is preventing them
from becoming a deep thinker or a
creative thinker you can live and die
inside these intellectual structures if
you choose to but people of curiosity
usually find themselves unsatisfied with
the conventional answers that is a quote
that I took from a lecture from Terence
McKenna uh my friend in the comments you
recommended me to watch something from
Terence McKenna I appreciate you don't
have your name right now but thank you
for turning me on to him I would like to
go ahead and expand that favor to you
all search Terence McKenna lecture on
YouTube go on a walk listen to it by
YouTube Pro so you can turn off your
phone and still listen and just let
things go that's what I like to do Alan
Watts lectures actualize.org Terence
McKenna those are all great places to
kind of expand your mind and not get
sucked into some kind of uh cheap
dopamine cycle on social media these are
long lectures that I would encourage you
to take multiple days if not weeks to
listen to and Munch on the ideas not be
bombarded by
500 ideas a day just by scrolling
through social media and overwhelming
your mind and not having any Clarity on
what to do with your future I could go
on and on about how we are such a
robotic species we have much less
self-control than we believe we do as an
example
I want to talk about Cycles patterns
rhythms and just normalization in
general so think about the Cycles in
your personal life we have an ingestion
cycle what we eat we have an excretion
cycle so how you go to the bathroom
every day right do you even think about
that or is it like I have to go I'm
going to the bathroom right now and that
happens on a cycle right that's kind of
a micro cycle from day to day but we
also have a sex cycle even if you don't
have a partner you dirty dog we have a
work cycle and even just this past um
week I've been having migraines every
morning it sucks if you've had a
migraine not a headache don't act like
you've had a migraine if you've only had
a headache if you've had a migraine you
know you had a migraine and that
sucks right it just sucks and it's weird
because this is a cycle that I've
noticed it happens every like three
years in my life and I haven't
pinpointed why it happens maybe it's
just random but me noticing these Cycles
helps me break out of that and
potentially create a solution for that
this is really very bad practice I
didn't have a migraine this morning
because caffeine helps with migraines I
put a Diet Mountain Dew by my bed
the first thing I did when I wake up is
chug that Mountain Dew and I didn't have
a migraine so
caffeine works not something I'm going
to sustain for a long time but it's just
funny to think about and these personal
Cycles can also vary for the Hobbies you
do or the goals you're trying to achieve
like a bodybuilder for example has
cutting and bulking Cycles they also
have a much possibly a more frequent
ingestion cycle of meals right eat five
to six meals a day and that kind of
controls their life and then even more
so you can see how deep this goes where
there can be business Cycles as well
there are business Cycles because
business is fairly unpredictable in many
cases my content some of my content is
going to do very good sometimes it's
going to do very bad and I just have to
accept that sometimes I'm going to have
a high month sometimes I'm going to have
a low month I can control that to an
extent in terms of like my income or my
content doing well but overall the high
highs aren't sustainable High highs
imply that there are going to be low
lows and so on and so forth and so
speaking of season
the world as a whole or the cosmos as a
whole seems to occur in Cycles from the
top down and these impact human behavior
so it goes like Cosmic worldly cultural
societal social personal there may be
more in between that but those are major
things like in a social situation how
you mirror someone else's body as the
conversation goes on that's a cycle that
you may not be conscious of or in
control of or how as a culture in the
states we celebrate Halloween right or
Christmas or Thanksgiving and these
things come up in cycles and we prepare
for them and we do things unconsciously
according to those things or when winter
comes or when summer comes we change the
clothes that we wear and all of these
different things that we don't have to
give conscious thought because they're
cyclical they're repetitive they're
conditioned into our brains and even
more so something that a lot of people
should become conscious of over these
coming months is the political cycles
and how Allah lot of people get overly
emotional during those times simply
because they're unconscious and they
have certain expectations and beliefs
for the mental construction that other
people have created for certain
individuals that attach to those mental
constructions can reside in as a home
like the uh Terence mechanic quote from
earlier if you subscribe to a political
ideology and
someone threatens that house of a mental
home that you live in or a mental
construction that you live in they
threaten the foundation they try to tear
that construction apart you as a being
are going to feel threatened you're
going to have a stress response you're
going to get emotional without your own
control you're not going to be mindful
of it and then
things are going to go to and
you're not going to enjoy your life
simply because you don't understand that
the the impacts of closed-mindedness
that we're talking about throughout this
entire thing your inability to see and
think deeper so to summarize all of that
uh The Matrix is what you think you know
and the way you break free of the Matrix
or create a glitch in The Matrix is to
break free of your robotic Behavior to
become conscious of and break free of
your robotic Behavior by doing something
different now this is a bad and extreme
example but it's it's doable right
you're gonna live but if you're going
through a sleep cycle and you want to
make some new discoveries or you want to
kind of notice things that you haven't
noticed before this is just one example
don't sleep for a night
break the Sleep Cycle right break the
Sleep Cycle don't sleep wake up the next
day and notice how your mind reacts
notice how it tries to revert back now
of course a lot of this is biological
but you're going to make some
interesting discoveries about yourself
and just the world now this doesn't only
apply to sleeping but it just it just
means breaking out of the cycles that
you have control over so the personal
Cycles like intermittent fasting if you
haven't tried intermittent fasting or
fasting as a whole fast for a day fast
from food don't eat because whether you
like it or not if you don't break free
of these Cycles you are extremely
similar to other people and you are
going to get the same results as other
people in life and one cycle that I
would encourage everyone to break is the
conventional work or employee cycle at
least try building a hobby project and
potentially see it growing into some
kind of business or something that you
have more control over and so what do
you find what do you find when you break
out of this Matrix or just this web of
expectations or this elaborate and
complex uh Matrix or Construction in our
mind that we have created and reside in
for Comfort when you break out of it or
you try to see beyond it you are going
to experience the mystical the profound
and the unknown waiting to be explored
and now the the Trap here is to think
that you can
articulate these things right this is
what spiritual people have trouble with
is like trying to get people to try
spiritual things because you experience
something mystical you have a mystical
experience and you can't put it into
words because it can't be put into words
because it is being you you don't know
it it's not something that has been
conditioned into our brain it is
something that you learn to not
surrender to you can surrender to it
that's where the concept of surrender
and Faith come into play but you get to
explore it freely you get to explore the
Matrix freely and understand
um what it is and that it is just a way
of us organizing and making sense of the
mystical that is under us the infinite
intelligence that is under us and so
once you awaken to the fact that there
is this intelligence beneath us you can
begin to explore it and with that you
can bring your findings into your
creative work your Creations your
content your videos your your speaking
with other people in social situations
and everything like that and so this is
what creativity is right when you think
of a creative you think of some like an
artist sitting there and do you think
they're just like brooding over some
political election no they're in a deep
restful State and they're letting their
creative abilities come into play your
Edge is where you stop short or where
you compromise your fullest gift and
instead cater to your fears David data
that is a quote from the way of the
superior man great book highly
recommended so in relation to deep
thinking the Matrix Keeps Us trapped in
this in all of these surface level
thoughts so in order to reverse this
effect we have to tap into the unknown
and we have to seek to explore the
unknown but the thing with this is is
that you can't just throw yourself into
the unknown you can't just hurl yourself
into the middle of the ocean if you
don't know how to swim and expect to
survive or at least expect in this case
in the metaphorical sense and in a way
that we're thinking about now expect
your mental construction or yourself the
notion of self to survive because that's
just the thing Mystics and gurus and
monks they kind of reside in this
unknown territory and they have no sense
of self they have eradicated that no
self if you've heard of the term no self
this is what we're talking about here
where they don't live they don't play
the game of the material world now I
haven't reached this point yet I don't
know if I'll ever reach this point I
don't know if I want to reach this point
it's like Alan Watts he called himself a
bodhisattva where he has experienced the
mystical but he chooses to live in this
material world and kind of balance back
and forth between the two he plays the
external game but he knows that the
mystical
place he knows that it is there for him
when he needs it for the calmness and
the creativity that is there so here's a
graphic that I made for a last video and
it just shows the unknown is the big
black area all around and if you launch
yourself too far into it or you push too
far out of the known then you get
anxious but if you stay too far within
the known or this Matrix that we have
locked ourselves into then you get kind
of bored you think that life doesn't
have meaning and you start to believe
that there really is no point but when
you live at the edge or when you push or
when you're at the edge of your fears or
that fear kicks into place are you going
to hide back in the known or your little
comfortable home in your mind or are you
going to push out a bit and expose
yourself to deeper experiences now this
is just the thing you have to start
exposing yourself to deeper experiences
if you want to kind of unlock that
experience to tap back into when it
comes time to think deeply creatively or
even freely so at the start our goal is
to just get a bit uncomfortable we want
to puncture the known we want to
puncture it with consistent effort and
let Obsession pull us deeper when we
find a novel discovery that is when we
get that hit of excitement or dopamine
when we make a new discovery let's say
we're struggling we're struggling to
read something and we come across
something that we normally wouldn't have
had before if we just like skimmed
through it and didn't pay attention to
the depth of knowledge that is within a
book and it makes you want to research
another thing another thing and another
thing and you realize that you're
starting to explore this intelligence
without
being conscious of it because you're
going from connection connection and
then you're uh reflecting and you're
understanding the patterns that are
showing there and how these things are
connected right I've talked about in
previous videos like the rise of the
value Creator where uh a value Creator's
job is to explore the unknown and make
new discoveries by researching the
crevice of reality that they feel the
most compelled to so if you're
researching Fitness right you're you're
researching this little domain and your
job is to just connect all of these dots
by pushing the boundaries of what you
think you know so to understand the
progression of pushing into the unknown
or kind of opening our mind if you go
back to that graphic that I showed about
the known and the unknown think of the
known as your mind and the line around
it is the the closed-minded nature of
your mind right and so when you're
pushing into the unknown you're kind of
expanding your mind you're expanding
that barrier of the known until it
encompasses so much more that you can
tap into rather than just what you've
been taught in school the experiences
you've gone through that everyone else
has gone through and just living the
normal ordinary life that most people
are living if you're watching this video
I'm assuming you want more out of life
you want to do great things in this
world if that's not you then don't watch
this video or don't watch my channel so
let's talk about States and stages
states are a temporary State of
Consciousness that you can break into at
any time
like taking a psychedelic reading a
quote that eases your worries or feeling
extra creative after you write a few
words stages on the other hand are a
permanent stage of Consciousness like
reaching a new level in a game where you
have access to the powers you could only
previously receive with a power up like
a baseline level of Happiness this takes
development over time and does not
eliminate regressing into lower States
Of Consciousness like being stuck in a
rut so a state when you think of that
graphic a state is like you're kind of
launched into the unknown you have a
peak mystical experience but you can't
sustain that because you haven't gone
through the stages in order to maintain
that or when you are just feeling extra
creative or something like that and so
with a stage a stage comes from
experience exposure it comes from
gradually taking the steps to get to a
certain place like in business right you
don't just go from zero to one million
dollars a month you go from zero to 100
or 1000 then you go to 5000 and you
slowly work your way up it's all an
exponential curve and so our goal is to
reach new stages in the unknown or
expand our mind to new stages of
Consciousness and that is to expose
yourself to new experiences in every
aspect or facet of your life and then
this leads to a deeper awareness of what
is possible because how you you can't
improve what you aren't aware of you
can't take action on what you are aren't
aware of right if you're trying to get
into business and you're seeing all
these people pulling a ton of money you
you you're not going to have the skill
set that they have right you have to
start with one skill like web design and
then open your awareness to like oh I
could make this skill better by stacking
it with copywriting and now you have web
design and copywriting and you can uh
that skill becomes much more effective
and it's like okay well what comes next
right then you open your mind to let's
say email marketing you tack that on you
had a lead Magnet or an opt-in to your
page you have some email sequences and
the skills stack over time so you're not
going to be able to get to expert level
of having this perfect set of skills
that makes a ton of money until you
learn the first skill so as an example
and a humble Flex if you will just
because it's uh recent to me it's a new
experience to me and it's fresh in my
mind and that's why I use it in my
newsletters and in my videos
for this time around is that when I
started in business I had like I made
like my first 300 bucks selling web
design right then I got better I stayed
consistent I learned new things through
experience that wouldn't have been able
to be taught in a course and then over
time
I hit a high month of ten thousand
dollars but my Baseline was still like
like two thousand dollars a month right
but then I kept going and then the state
would increase to like I had my first
fifty thousand dollar month and then my
Baseline was twenty thousand and then
recently I've had two one hundred
thousand dollar months in a row and now
my Baseline is maybe I don't know what
it is yet but it could be like fifty
thousand it could have jumped
exponentially higher I'm not sure that's
going to take time for me to understand
but then when I have a state of like my
first million dollars in half a year
then my Baseline is going to increase
whatever it may be and hopefully I can
stop and balance around a million
dollars a year I feel like that's
probably too much I don't know we'll see
when we get there because that's the
thing is you don't know until you
accomplish it right that's what a lot of
people
fail to see I fail to see it everyone
fails to see it at some point in their
life but it's like a lot of people
um
talk about others
for their certain situation
specifically with celebrities or
something else like you see people in
the comment section and they're like oh
uh like yeah this guy is this this and
this they're just assuming expectations
they're living in a web of expectations
that has been conditioned into their
brain and they're projecting those
assumptions and expectations on the
other people like oh this person's
unhappy oh this person should do this
with their money or they should do that
and it's like you don't know what they
know you don't know what they should do
with their money until you've
experienced where they're at through
action and gaining experience and have
lived the life that they've lived then
most if not all of the words that you
are speaking about them are just
complete and utter nonsense and
completely worthless it's like you have
better things to do with your time go
and improve your own life so you can
experience things and make better
decisions for yourself because no one's
ever going to make you happy right this
is a common saying but it's like it's
not going to make you happy if they go
and give a million of the a million
dollars to charity because then you're
gonna pick something else up and just
get stuck in this continual trap of
blaming other people for their problems
and not even worrying about your own so
back on track the the slow and
consistent steps to
expanding your mind and just experience
of the world in stages slow and
consistent stages with occasional states
that like bust into higher and higher
levels and you get a peak into that
level so you have something to work
towards but there are times when intense
growth makes sense right and that's
usually a product of consistent growth
right you can if you're not acting
consistently you're never going to give
your chance at
uh intensity but sometimes the things
just make sense right when you feel the
pull or you feel the call to move across
the country drop everything sell all of
your stuff and go live a new life and
you really feel that you've been
thinking about it for a year
then you haven't gone and done it yet
you haven't gone and experienced it
maybe it's time take the leap because
that stressful environment that pressure
that something on the line
like moving to another country and
having to fight for your survival in
order to
get to a new stage or Baseline where you
can survive there may be what you need
in order to make all of that progress so
here's a tweet of mine that got some
good engagement it's one of my top
tweets that people seem to like and it
summarizes all of this pretty well if
you're lost the answer is education if
you're educated the answer is action if
you are acting the answer is consistency
so it only makes sense to match
knowledge with execution you don't want
to learn from someone that's 10 stages
ahead of you because it's not going to
make sense you don't understand what's
there you need to learn from someone
that's one stage ahead of you and then
you need to match that execution so you
become aware of that little bubble of
awareness that they have at stage two
and then you go to stage three and you
slowly expand your awareness to
encapsulate everything that you're
experiencing and learning along the way
and this is how you create good dopamine
cheap dopamine comes from receiving
novelty without struggle good dopamine
comes from creating novelty through
struggle now here's a graphic where you
can see this you have U on one end
instant desire on the other hand bing
bing bing bing bing you got dopamine
right there Then you have you an
intrinsic desire and the highs and lows
that come with that right the highs and
lows are necessary because that's where
you get good dopamine it's not just
instant it's not at the click of a phone
or just like looking at your phone it
comes from
what we've been talking about this
entire time breaking free of the Matrix
through experience exposure exposing
yourself to new experiences on a
consistent basis so meaning you have to
set your own goals your own goals
educate yourself on how to reach them
and execute at the edge of your fear if
you have problems with fear go and watch
my video on why fear of failure is
ruining your life I feel like that's an
underrated video of mine and it should
really help reframe what you think of
fear and failure and just to make a
connection about the cycles that we
talked about earlier you could consider
cheap dopamine a part of your cycle
right how often do you check your phone
every day how compulsive is it do you
even know when you're like are you
conscious of the fact that you're
pulling your phone out of your pocket
and staring at it and starting to scroll
and so while there's many methods for
breaking out of your comfort zone or
diving into the unknown or exposing
yourself to new experiences here are
ones here are three or four that are red
readily available to you right now and
that you can do on a consistent date
on a consistent basis you can make this
a part of your daily practice so the
first one is reading right and a lot of
people they don't read because it's a
lot of stuff they're not getting that
quick valuable information without the
fluff all of a sudden when the fluff is
where you're going to make new
discoveries that's the stupidest
argument I've ever heard is like oh I
want the ACT I want the value without
the fluff and it's like the fluff is
where the magic happens so when you read
don't stop at the first hint of struggle
or lack of comprehension that's where
you're going to prime your mind to
actually learn the lesson that is trying
to teach you whether it be one year or
10 years right when I first read a book
let's say The Power of Now I didn't
understand uh some of its teachings but
then when I come back and read it five
years later I understand it all and
that's because I primed my mind
to try to experience those things in my
life just because I read it on paper but
now when you're reading and you catch a
whiff of something that's interesting or
that excites you don't neglect that stop
reading and start researching it further
right if you're reading a book on
Fitness and you read something about
muscular tension and you're like I don't
know what that is I want to learn more
and you start reading about muscular
attention it takes you down this rabbit
hole and eventually you become obsessed
with Fitness and you create a lifestyle
out of it so number two is writing every
single writer or creative struggles with
writers or creative blocks and people
think this is a bad thing when is it is
the best thing that could ever happen to
you this is when your mind is ready to
munch on those problems right this is
when you go on a walk this is when you
drop things after you hit a wall with
your writing this implies that you have
to start writing when you hit a wall
with your writing you go on a walk you
lay by the pool you rest you let your
brain
turn on the default mode Network so we
can start munching on those problems in
your subconscious mind and then out of
nowhere boom you have this Revelation or
this discovery or an idea is sent to
your conscious mind and you write that
down and then you're able to continue
writing right because if you're stuck in
this instant gratification mindset and
you're like like oh I can't write
this this and this right now then put it
down you're allowed to write a piece
over the the entirety of a week or a
month or however long it takes and so if
you want to get into writing check out
my course the two hour writer I
attribute almost every thing in my life
to writing right my mental health my
business success all content is based
around writing even this YouTube video
my Instagram my Twitter my LinkedIn it's
all writing my podcast it all starts
with a script that is the most
profitable and
non-replaceable skill that you can learn
creative skill that you can learn that
just pairs with any other skill you
choose to learn so number three is
teaching because our goal is to become a
deep original and free thinker but I'm
going to save number three I wrote this
earlier in my newsletter if you're not
on it join it but I wrote about teaching
in the next video that we're going to do
on how I remember everything I learned
so I don't want to do it Injustice by
bringing it up here but you want to
teach what you learn in order to
solidify it right if you haven't already
look up the Feynman Feynman technique
which is where you you pretty much learn
teach what you learn identify the
knowledge gaps in uh where you struggle
to teach things like if you were to
teach to a YouTube video you can watch
back over it and see where you up
and then you can go and fill in those
knowledge gaps and then come back to
teaching and that is how you retain a
lot of your knowledge that's there's
some study or something that shows that
teaching retains the most knowledge
um
compared to other methods so that is it
for this video I know this one was a bit
of abstract but that is the point
because I've noticed we've we've grown
quite a bit on YouTube recently and I've
noticed that a lot of uh the things that
get clicks and Views are the one-person
business videos and
um just like the Practical lessons that
I've learned when a lot of people
neglect the thing behind all of that all
of the abstractions and philosophical
and creative ideas that make it work and
that's what I like dissecting the most
that's what I feel like is the most
helpful is your ability to think freely
and figure things out for yourself
um rather than relying on a step-by-step
system to get immediate instant
gratifying results so if you enjoyed
this episode and watch to the end uh
please like the video please subscribe
for more I'm going to have a balance or
I am going to continue the balance of
like practical and Abstract just because
they're both extremely important
and if you want to dive deeper you can

five bucks with the link in the

things that are there there's the
