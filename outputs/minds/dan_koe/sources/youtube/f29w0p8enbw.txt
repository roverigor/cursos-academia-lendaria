myrrh the Middle Ages also known as the
Dark Ages were a time of War famine and
pandemics what came after set the scene
for modern civilization which was the
Renaissance Era which birthed a lot of
the thinkers artists and other people
that we know today history repeats
itself and the digital dark ages are
among us but there is a light on the
horizon the digital dark ages are a time
of distraction close-mindedness and
cheap dopamine we've lost touch with the
belief systems that used to give an
individual a sense of certainty and a
positive outlook on the world but those
systems have slowly we've lost trust in
them over time a lot of people have
experienced this and if we don't take it
on ourselves to create our own sense of
purpose and order our lives in alignment
with that then it will be difficult to
maintain the little sanity that we have
left so as we talked about in two videos
ago you need a Vision or purpose for
your future and you need a structure or
hierarchy of goals in the in order to
frame your attention towards that and
eliminate distractions and that is how
you create an endless source of good
dopamine is by endlessly solving the
right problems so if you don't do this
you'll find Solace and a few things the
first is the societal machine the clear
path of going to school getting a job
and retiring happily is very enticing so
most people relinquish their freedom to
choose in their free agency their
autonomy and end up just doing what
they're told the second is momentary
Pleasures deep down we know that we
aren't making the right choices our
future self is looking down on us and we
know this and it makes us feel bad about
our decisions but we don't know how to
we get trapped in this little mental
Loop of not knowing what to do and so to
numb ourselves from this pain we'd drown
it in momentary Pleasures we binge
Netflix we go out and drink we do a lot
of things to escape uh confronting our
problems and while I continually say
that there's nothing wrong with these
things there is a lot that can be wrong
with these things if you aren't
conscious of the choices you are making
so a third is modern distractions and
distractions are not just digital
distractions are every single thing that
does not align with your purpose or
vision for the future and if you don't
have a vision how are you going to
filter what is distraction from what is
worth focusing on and so the Catalyst to
all of these distractions is you it's
your thoughts beliefs identity that has
been forged over time that is what keeps
our mind narrow and focused on what we
know rather than diving into the unknown
and so all three of those things that we
just talked about can be grouped
together under one big thing which is
the greatest trap of the 21st century
closed mindedness the most dangerous
habit young people can form is closed
mindedness you are capable of more than
you've been told you are so
close-mindedness is your inability to
see beyond your narrow perspective in
any situation and if your perspective
only shines a negative light on the
situation that's even worse let's take
the social media comment section for
example I'm not necessarily talking
about mine we all go to like Reddit and
Instagram and sometimes we get caught in
the comments and you just can see that
it's very common for someone to
completely miss the point misinterpret
it Cherry picks something spin it in a
negative light and end up leaving
something that just turns it creates a
lot of negativity in other people and
turns people away from what's actually
being said what the true message is in
that thing and so it's when people read
something like a a polarizing political
post online and then they get offended
and then they go on to leave a comment
that conveniently leaves out the
perspective that would prove their own
wrong right so they give their
perspective which is completely goes
against the other one and then those
clash and there's no Common Ground found
that's closed-mindedness is when there's
You Don't See to find common ground you
seek to prove others wrong rather than
proving yourself wrong and so this alone
is you can see where I was saying how
close-mindedness kind of encapsulates
everything else like distractions
momentary Pleasures Etc because this is
just another embodiment of the Quick Fix
mindset it's a quick fix like to win the
game of that political battle let's say
a political post on social media and
someone says something that you don't
like you get that quick hit of whether
it's dopamine or just a bad feeling that
you are addicted to that's why you're
making the post why else would you make
it I think you can zoom out and realize
that your post is doing absolutely
nothing in the grand scheme of things
you're wasting your time and time is
 important the universe is an
infinite song UNI verse Universe one
song So songs are symbolic of stories
you can assume like a song has a
story-like structure to it and that also
reflects in games and that's why we
enjoy these things so much is because of
the highs lows the conflict the rising
action the climax the falling action the
happy ending all of that stuff we find a
lot of interest and meaning in those
things and that's what makes life
enjoyable that's why people get obsessed
with video games that's why people that
can see business as a game get obsessed
with business that's why people can zoom
that can zoom out and create a game out
of a certain situation can find
enjoyment in most situations in life and
the problem here with closed-mindedness
is that we we fail to see this
overarching story right even just a big
story we take the smallest story
possible like the conflict going on and
completely ignore the rest of what's
going on from a universal perspective
and then we we take that and act like it
should make sense when clearly it's not
going to and so if you take like a
negative part of a battle or you take
the lowest low of a story like if you're
in a low point in life and the only
thing that your mind can see is that low
point in life that you're at and you
don't understand that after a low comes
a high and even before a low comes a
high and then up down and there's going
to be a climax eventually and all this
other stuff you're going to get trapped
in that negative thought Loop and it's
not going to be fun so let's start
expanding our mind right that's what we
have to do to open our mind Beyond
close-mindedness and understand that
none of this happens overnight you're
just not gonna have a monk-like
perspective
um after you've been very close-minded
for a while it takes time and
self-development that's why it's called
development it's because it takes time
but first we have to understand a few
signs of closed-mindedness right because
then we can become aware of them we can
become aware of the problems or mistakes
and then be able to improve those so
awareness begets Improvement because we
need to become aware in order to
actually improve it and then Improvement
begets awareness of the next but better
problem to solve so the first sign that
you need to become aware of is
assumption and expectation mostly in the
negative sense very much so in the
negative sense right creating a vision
for your future is kind of like a
positive assumption or expectation in
this case negative assumption and
expectation can be extremely dangerous
so your reality is determined by your
conditioning that is your identity
houses your perspective and your
perspective houses your beliefs thoughts
and prior experiences most of the time
that you hold as truth and for most
people this perspective or worldview is
shared with their parents teachers and
other people so all if all you know is
school work retirement then your
behavior will follow that because the
conditioning it creates limits on what
you think is possible and so if you
don't know a possibility other than
school work retirement then you aren't
going to act in a way that is going to
actualize that Vision right it just
doesn't make sense and so what these are
are expectations for your future that
you are going to work in alignment with
right so if you have vision for your
future that you may think is positive
but overall because you haven't zoomed
out and seen the consequences of
following that path then it's a
masquerade it is negative and not
conducive to what you actually want out
of life and so those that web of
expectations or assumptions in your mind
are eventually going to lead to behavior
that actualize those things so the
second sign you need to become aware of
whether it be in yourself or in others
just through observation especially on
social media you can notice a lot of
this stuff on social media is having a
selfish perspective overly selfish
perspective what you have to realize is
that everyone is acting towards a goal
when they are acting right and this goal
can be conscious subconscious or
unconscious and for most people it is in
alignment with their survival they're
working to survive something and so if
humans survive on a conceptual level
they're going to work to survive their
Identity or maintain their narrow
perspective and therefore they're going
to act in a way that preserves their
self-image and this isn't hard to spot
right so it's to bring up the political
example again if people are die-hard
Republicans or Die Hard Democrats and
you see them arguing online and some
people are willing to die over that
belief they're willing to die over it a
split black and white party rather than
pulling truth from both and having a
truly uh holistic perspective on
politics from a a standpoint of
Consciousness the same thing reflects in
business right you see people arguing uh
Which business model is the best and if
I identify as a freelancer or even if I
am pushing the one-person business model
ideology in a sense in some cases it
could be I try to I personally try to
make it very clear that it is for a
person with a specific set of goals so
they can align their goals with that and
see if it's something they want to do
but in many cases what people do and I'm
a victim of this myself I do it too is
the fact of people promoting theirs as
the best business model there is right
so freelancing is the best business
model and most mostly Freelancers say
that because that's what they've done
right or agency owners that's what
they've done so they promote it as the
best that's what they know how to do so
it only makes sense right same thing
with e-commerce startup software
whatever it may be and so if you want a
more holistic version of Truth or you
want to overcome this selfish
perspective then you need to practice
transferring Consciousness into that
person you need to have empathy you need
to understand okay or you need to at
least piece together a positive
assumption for what they are acting in
alignment with what goal they're trying
to achieve and this will shine light on
a lot of stuff but then you also have to
be willing to prove yourself wrong right
because this is a sign of
closed-mindedness in yourself so if you
are the one that is pushing certain
ideas as law then maybe it's time to
prove yourself wrong and go and study
the opposite perspective right have
empathy for another person that is
pushing the opposite of what you're
saying and then you can have both
versions of Truth and then you kind of
unlock this wisdom or intelligence that
allows you to navigate between those two
domains and as you do more and you
collect more Consciousness in a sense
and understand more perspectives from
other people in alignment with the goals
that they're acting towards then Things
become a lot better and you have so much
more Firepower to make your own thing
work in a better more holistic way and
you also have to understand like even
from a belief system perspective is that
some people with beliefs in this Western
world would literally be executed if
they go and push those beliefs in
another country right and and they don't
care how right you think you are and
from the perspective of the universe
like if you were to zoom out and see
things from the the division and unity
and self-reflection that the Universe
has for itself then you can see that one
everyone is right and everyone is wrong
it's all relative this reality is
subjective so the third sign of
closed-mindedness is missing the point
and a lot of the times this comes from
literal interpretation of words right if
I were to read the Bible and I'm not a
Christian and I just want to get
something from it right I want to
understand it then reading it from a
literal perspective like word for word
this is what happened that's probably
going to turn me off right but if I read
it from a metaphorical perspective and
understand that it's symbolic of some
form of truth then I can actually learn
something from it so when I was first
reading The Power of Now I believe back
then I identified as an atheist at the
time and so when I read that book
whenever he would mention the concept of
God per se then I would get this weird
feeling in me but I really tried to
overcome that right I knew that there
was some something that could help me in
that book and so I tried to see past
that and with time I kind of dissolved
or worked past that problem in my life
and so missing the point also goes back
to what we talked about about taking a
certain piece of the story or the game
or or the
the universe like one song that is being
played right because you wouldn't you
wouldn't take one lyric from a song that
you spot right now or a word that I'm
saying or a sentence that I'm saying
take it out of context so take the lyric
out of the song and expect it to make it
Sense on its own you have to understand
the goal that people are working towards
and so the goal with this video is to
help you open your mind to newer
perspectives and so if you take
something and you close your mind that's
missing the point and so the fourth sign
of closed mindedness is Vision avoidance
so we discuss having a vision for your
life in almost every video but because
it's so important and and your vision
isn't clear in an instant you need a
constant reminder and it's it's very
uncertain right it's an uncertain path
to take in life and so people don't want
that uncertainty so they repress their
potential in life they know that there's
something more but they never go down
the rabbit hole of curiosity they never
break out of the things that they're
told to learn or the things that are
just handed to in front of them or
they're scrolling memes rather than
searching for some something that can
actually help them in life and so the
instant gratification of that feels good
now but hurts later when your vision is
the opposite where it hurts now and
feels good later and so you want to flip
this switch empty your mind be formless
shapeless like water you put water into
a cup it becomes the cup there's more to
that quote but that's from Bruce Lee
everyone knows that quote but how many
have sat with that quote and actually
thought about it what's its meaning
right if you were to sit with that do
you actually have a practical
application for that right in this case
with opening your mind that's what we're
talking about the cup is the perspective
and your Consciousness is being
structured by that perspective and
there's a reason behind this why it
works is because this is usually when
Peak experiences
um are most notable right when you tap
into the Flow State it's because your
Consciousness is ordered and you are you
have Clarity on what's going on there
you have the proper structure or cup to
fill your Consciousness with and so
that's one version of a peak experience
but other Peak experiences seem to
happen when you open your mind be all
beyond all limitation form or belief or
anything right so when you're meditating
you're usually trying to uh increase the
gap between your thoughts and kind of
open yourself to the world and so with
that you have to understand that
open-mindedness comes in stages so an
example in no specific order in stage
one you believe religion is the only
path to Salvation stage two you believe
religion is mind control stage three you
believe religion has deep truths when
interpreted from a metaphorical lens and
so in business this is similar stage one
you believe freelancing is the best
business model stage two you believe
business models are scams stage three
you believe that all business models
hold truths that can be used to improve
the one that aligns with your interests
oh and wow would you look at that a
course promotion that aligns just with
that check out digital economics Link in
the description it's it's a holistic
Business course that aligns with your
interests so some of those stages of
perspectives and open-mindedness are
more open-minded than others and the
ones that are more open-minded are the
ones that lead to more success because
the benefits of open-mindedness are
obvious deeper intelligence heightened
creativity less reactivity fulfilling
relationships novel content ideas if
you're a content creator and other
things like Artful navigation of what
would be polarizing domains like
politics so let's finally dive into some
practical aspects to start opening your
mind the first is critical thinking 101
you have to hold all thoughts ideas and
opinions in the realm of possibility
until filtered through direct experience
you do not have to prove something right
or wrong in an instant you are allowed
to let things marinate in your mind
without identifying with any side of the
argument and I don't care how many
people make it seem very urgent that you
have to pick a side and you have to to
choose something very quick you don't so
the second thing is to work towards a
more holistic identity your identity
houses your perspective your perspective
houses your beliefs and your beliefs
influence your thoughts emotions and
actions so if we adopt an identity that
is greater than us our mind or
perspective
fills that as such it expands as such
and it can only expand as much as the
things that we identify with and this is
how you develop your ego over time is by
slowly adopting a higher identity
because if you think about it so the ego
Works to survive on a conceptual level
as we always talk about but if we
identify with something higher right
then we're going to work to survive that
identity so with we identify as our
highest self and the things that they
would do then we're going to work to
survive that higher self and our
thoughts emotions actions are going to
follow that and so I'm I don't really
like talking about this because it can
get very confusing especially to like
biblical ideologues where I know a lot
of people like Alan wants Alan Watts has
once said that you are God I know other
people have said that as well many
people actually have said that but it
always gets that lash back right the
closed-minded last back of like you
can't be God God is the all-knowing and
the omnipotent and there's a the this
could be an entire topic but a good way
to approach it at least at the beginning
for this is that if you adopt the
perspective of God right as a Creator
and we aren't talking about the
Christian notion of God here who is like
a man in the sky we're talking about the
universe and its processes and
Consciousness and form and Division and
unity and creation and destruction and
understanding and seeing the world from
a big picture while acting
from this vessel that you are and so
we're not again we're not talking about
the Christian notion of God we're
talking about uh what is like Brahman or
the absolute or infinity or source and
things like that this isn't only based
on religious stuff so if you're on a
sports team the snowbirds as an example
and you identify as a snowbird which you
should if you're on the team then the
spirit of that team will form a
collective ego that the the team Works
to survive and that spirit will be
spread throughout fans and it will have
a decent impact on how the game goes
when you are acting as a team in that
Spirit or energy is there so the same is
true with identifying with a corporate
job where your perspective is limited to
that job and the same thing with let's
say a family right and now I'm not
saying that these things are bad I'm
saying that you should become aware of
them you need to become like water and
the cup and the water right you should
be able to flow and pour into different
cups and understand them without staying
static in one without freezing into one
cup and please understand that we're
identifying in mind or Spirit here not
physicality or intellect because if you
want to identify as something as hyper
limiting as like a toaster oven or an
Apache attack helicopter I think those
memes are funny too but I'm just saying
then be my guest or go back to the part
of the video where I talk about
intentionally missing the point and
taking a part of the argument out unless
that point is humor of course because
humor is useful and I don't see it doing
any harm unless people intentionally
miss the point and so if you are the
universe right you adopt that
perspective from a mental level then
your petty human problems tend to lose
their weight right they don't they kind
of lose their impact on your life and
then you're able to act from a better
perspective from right here right think
big act small and so you have to
understand that we're not identifying
with the universe for things like
nobility or status or something else
that is very selfish right we're doing
it to improve our decision making in a
way that benefits more than ourself and
that is seeing beyond your survival and
thinking twice about going from one
pleasurable distraction to the next so
another example is like if you love beer
right and that's your life's work you
just love beer you absolutely love it
and you want to spread your passion for
that beer to the world then it would
make sense that your life's work is to
start up a brewery and
create the best beer and pass along to
the customers and then they pass it
along to someone else and everyone's
happy having a beer at your place right
that is a very worthy thing to do even
though alcohol is involved you're still
spreading a positive message a positive
vibe and you are seeing your work for
more than just like a means of income
and so if you love something like
philosophy or self-development or
something else that can be benefited in
the Creator economy like we always talk
about and you're very passionate about
that how are you going to spread that
passion to other people through your
writing rather than just treating it as
a means to income so step number three
is collecting Consciousness I want you
to understand that all of this
everything that we talk about think of
it on like a decade-long time scale this
isn't for the quick fix people that's
why my videos are a bit longer and
sometimes they're a bit rambly is
because I know that the people that get
the value out of them aren't going to
click off simply because I didn't stroke
their little ego or pleasure Reward
Center for five minutes when I went
amount of rent and also understand that
I'm Not An Almighty Guru that knows
everything and is going to give 100
accurate advice all the time this is my
level of understanding and it's what I'm
working towards so to collect
Consciousness you need to be able to
transfer Consciousness and seek to
understand not judge and this isn't
anything like unique to humans either a
predator as an example can transfer
Consciousness into its prey and assume
its next moves it's not necessarily
planning it just knows like okay I can
assume what mistakes it's going to make
and I'm going to position myself in
order to
the prey and so if a predator can do
this then a marketer can do this or you
can do this right so marketers are very
good at this or even just content
creators or something in general is
because they understand human psychology
that's what you should study in order to
do this better is human psychology
Marketing sales in order to understand
the minds of other people and be able to
transfer Consciousness so that you are
able to help them in a beneficial manner
with your content product Services
life's work whatever it may be and so
this is really like a a big hack for
let's say a writer right I talk about
this in my course the two-hour writer
for Content writing but transfer your
Consciousness into your reader or the
viewer in this sense right are they
going to like engage and share with the
content like have you even thought about
that about how your content is going to
be received by the other person and if
it's not good and you don't think
they're going to share it how can you
make it better and so what about that
driver that cut you off on the side of
the road or on the road and then you got
angry right can you transfer your
Consciousness into them and assume
something positive about what they're
doing what what if their mother's in the
hospital and they're trying to get over
and get off on the exit then you're over
here worried about your comfort oh I
have to step on the brake a little bit
to let this guy through oh my
God I'm gonna die and so again focus on
the big picture here I feel like a lot
of people get wrapped up in the little
technical details with all this we're
not trying to transfer Consciousness so
we can like steal their knowledge or
what they know or the words in their
mouth or the way they articulate things
we want to understand the essence or
experience of the situation at hand we
want to note patterns and we also want
to understand their actions and observe
the outcomes because then from those
things when we understand those things
and we collect that Consciousness with
time then our decision making improves
tenfold and so just to touch on that
again is because this is always a common
problem I want to just nip it in the
butt right here like it's obvious that
you can't like if you're if you transfer
Consciousness like we're saying into
someone that speaks a different language
you're not going to learn the language
right you're not going to know the
language we're talking about
understanding here not knowledge those
are a different thing knowledge is like
built up it is a mental construction
understanding it is is an inherent part
of human consciousness so we are seeking
the essence Beyond mere human existence
it's like how strength not only reflects
in a bodybuilder but it reflects in the
universe as being able to like hold up
the world with a gravitational constant
like just holding it randomly or in uh
the strength of a bear or in the
strength of a mother right there are
patterns that you can notice that again
going back to signs of the closed-minded
and literal interpretation that you can
understand from a metaphorical lens all
understanding is metaphorical so step
number four is to pause and question so
here's a challenge for you is to study
the exact opposite of your beliefs if
you're a vegan study carnivore if you're
a freelancer study a Creator or a
personal brand and how they get clients
if you're a Christian study atheists and
you want to approach the situation by
trying to prove yourself wrong this is
very difficult and you will experience
an ego reaction but the people that can
work through this will see so much
results and a lot more peace in their
life and you will feel physically
threatened you will have a physical
threat response as you are reading these
things become aware of that too and how
just absurd that is and so when you when
this reaction happens right because this
is kind of like a way to force a
reaction in you so that you can become
aware of it and then you can seek to
understand it and then improve it and
overcome it and so questions are how you
deepen understanding right so I want you
to pick a business a religion
um a political ideology that you
disagree with study it wait for the
reaction and then walk through these
questions is there something I can learn
in this situation what goal are they
working to achieve does that align with
my goals and does it does it matter if
not what is the context they are saying
this from what is the essence or lesson
of what they are saying can I
incorporate an aspect of their beliefs
into my own and with time these should
birth some incredible insights now
lastly step number five the most
important step of them all is think
macro act micro or the art of zooming
out you are a perspective vessel and
your actions whether you are conscious
of her or not has a ripple effect on the
world I wish I had this uh anecdote at
the top of my mind but I remember
there's some like fun fact where like a
butterfly flapping his wings wings if it
flies in a certain location it can like
destroy an entire Iceberg or or like
something right it's something insane
that the little flapping of a
butterfly's Wings can cause such
destruction if it flies in a certain
part of the world and so as you open
your mind to embody a more holistic
perspective your actions should follow
suit so you want to think big picture
forget the petty details and act and so
we're closing in on the ending here but
please do not just like take this video
and like not do anything with it right I
feel like everyone can benefit from some
form of mental expansion or opening
their mind and so along this path you
are going to encounter problems right
when you open your mind there's going to
be some resistance there and you need to
become aware of that and you need to
solve those problems and make mistakes
that's how you improve and you have to
understand that the highest version of
every single one of you right and the
vision that you hold in your mind for
that highest version of yourself is
open-minded so try to expand your mind
to embody that identity try it this week
really try it this week first think
about what you want in the future and
who you have to become in order to get
there and then start trying to view
situations from that perspective so that
is it for this one a few plugs before we
leave is that the first solopreneur
