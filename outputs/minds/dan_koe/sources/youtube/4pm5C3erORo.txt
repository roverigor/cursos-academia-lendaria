the first business course that I bought
was a six-figure agency course that was
six years ago before that I didn't
really see the value in courses and I
see people talk about this quite a bit
it used to be very common where people
just don't trust courses at all and I
was the same way I didn't trust courses
I didn't trust the people selling them I
knew that all of the information could
be found online whether it be from
YouTube videos or less expensive courses
like on udemy but that never worked I
didn't see any results with it and it's
clear why it's because the information
is so scattered and even on social media
platforms I know this well right this is
what I do is in order for me to grow
which is main priority right I don't
want to be stuck at zero subscribers
posting into the void just hoping
someone finds my hyper valuable content
you have people are playing the game of
catching attention delivering some form
of value whether it be uh just
educational actionable advice or
entertainment or a mix of both but it's
usually short sweet and just focused on
high performing topics and the topics
like most of the topics inside of the
six figure agency course that I took if
you would have put those online in a
separate video without people showing
intent by actually purchasing a course
it nobody would talk about it it's just
so boring and nobody wants to
actually sit down and listen to those
things and especially when there is not
any money or pain on the line to
actually implement the strategies that
you are purchasing it just doesn't make
sense there's a lot of psychology
involved in purchasing a course putting
something on the line actually forcing
yourself to sit down with the boring
strategies and Implement them right
rather than just looking for some form
of entertainment online and hoping that
you can find the perfect balance of
entertainment and value so that you can
just endlessly consume content while
doing nothing about your life and don't
act like you're immune into this nobody
is immune to this I'm not immune to this
right I click on things mindlessly on my
phone and end up watching for a minute
before I realize like what the am I
doing why am I actually watching this I
could be doing something better and so
when I was fed up with my multiple
business attempts and just trying to
learn online and learn the fundamentals
and buy books and other things I was Fed
Up frankly I I didn't want anything to
do with the space anymore but I wanted
to give myself one last try so I
researched the best or the latest and
greatest business models to get into
um something that could take me to six
figures in income which at the time like
it's a good thing to aim for six figures
at the start uh but you soon realize
that that is just the beginning of all
of this so I found a dude that had a
good reputation his name's Billy Wilson
if you want to go research him I haven't
looked at him very much in the past but
Billy Wilson I paid 9.99 or 9.97 for his
six-figure agency course and it was a
great course I learned a lot for from it
but it was a huge chunk out of my
finances I was like
at my final straw where I had tried so
many different business models this one
had to work or else I go back to coding
or getting a web design job the the
entire story is a kind of like jumble of
multiple business failures and then
eventually getting a job and then
eventually making one work but this
course was like me getting dead serious
about making all of this stuff work and
so with that with that pressure on the
line and me about to drop out of school
and deciding whether or not I should
actually do the homework and at a
part-time job at the time everything
just added up to the point where once I
saw that first bit of resistance from
actually like reaching out to people
cold emailing them getting on a call
actually trying to make the business
work it all made sense but there's just
so much pressure in my life that it all
felt pieces I didn't get results and I
ended up having to get a job because
that was uh it made the most sense at
the time and so this course again was
great it taught me about the
applicability of copyright writing sales
marketing funnels paid ads all of these
things that I had been learning about
like compartmentalized through my
YouTube research and on social media
this was all packaged up clean here's
how it all works in the form of an
agency business model and so I went on
to take this because now it makes sense
for almost any business model it's like
I need this piece I need this piece I
need this piece I need this this piece
and if you want to understand those
pieces check out the one person business
model playlist that I have and the one
million dollar skill stack where I go
over like which skills you should learn
in order to apply to almost every single
business model so there were three
things that destroyed my chance at
success here and this is on top of the
the pressure in my life the first was
that I didn't give a flying about
running a Facebook ads agency I didn't
want to actually work on my business
second thing is that cold emailing local
businesses was time consuming stressful
and none of them had the money to pay me
now of course I could Target richer
people or people that had more money but
eventually I found a solution to this
after uh seeing some success with web
design and cold email this is why I
always recommend starting a personal
brand now it's the future if you're not
already on the train I don't know where
you've been I don't know what videos
you've been watching but personal brand
have leads come to you and have an
authoritative profile so when you
actually do call DM people it is much
better than a random email showing up in
someone's inbox now I'm not saying it's
bad all around it's a very good strategy
I'm just saying for most people it makes
thousand percent sense to start
delivering value via a personal brand if
you're afraid to write content for free
then you shouldn't even be thinking
about working for a client your first
client without much experience it goes
both ways you have to start you don't
have to fake it till you make it but you
have to start posting and delivering
value that you are learning and that you
are going to help clients with anyways
in exchange for a lot of money it
doesn't make sense why people don't
start a personal brand and the third
thing was I was never confident in my
Niche and that led to an immense amount
of friction and shiny object syndrome so
this whole Facebook ads agency that the
journey along with it taught me a lot
that a lot of things that I would use in
my future business models and it
identified a problem that would repeat
time and time again when I started these
businesses or when I had something going
well I would always come back and
question what is my Niche right choosing
a niche is the biggest problem ever in
this Creator economy everyone one talks
about it and
I I mean I work directly with people in
modern Mastery and digital economics
it's just a recurring issue time and
time again so it's been on my mind time
and time again to try and deliver a
solution right because that's what you
do as a Creator is you take problems and
you think about them you contemplate you
research you write your own stuff you
pull from your direct experience and my
experience growing and long story short
this is what I've found but before we
dive in there is a new style of cohort
that I'm running it starts on February
7th I would recommend you check it out
links in the description in short we're
going to be creating your niche of one
and this is all as a personal brand
creating your niche of one writing 20
plus foundational pieces of content I'm
going to be writing them with you on the
screen and we are going to outline a
growth strategy for your social media in
reality it's just networking but how to
network properly build relationships get
new opportunities whether it be a job
opportunity freelance clients or or just
meeting great people that'll help you
grow all of that is 150 right this isn't
an expensive cohort like I've ran in the
past where it's 9.99 or even 2000 it's
150 right for all of that good stuff so
check it out hope you enjoy it hope I
see you in there let's make this whole
one-person business thing simple one
build for yourself two write to yourself
three sell to yourself there are
millions of people with the same
interest problems and desires as you and
you only need to find a fraction of them
the most profitable Niche is you so that
Facebook Ad Agency that we talked about
earlier wasn't my first business
business attempt and it wasn't my last
so somewhere along this journey of mine
I stumbled or I started logging on to
Twitter more and some guy Jose Rosado
came across my page with like a
self-improvement tweet like a harsh
truth and I'm like oh Twitter isn't all
memes and I can actually find
people giving out value on Twitter and
surprisingly after I followed him and
more people showed up on my feed
um and I was exposed to This Money
Twitter people were giving out
incredible advice that I was just like
taking left and right and eventually it
just made sense to start a personal
brand on Twitter and so that's what I
started doing but one thing made me
stand out amongst all the others that is
I didn't have a static Niche so before
this we're all over the place here but
before this I was doing web design and
funnels for Server service businesses
and then I pivoted that offer as
marketing Consulting for creators
because that's who I wanted to work with
at the time right were the people that I
was following the people that I looked
up to it only made sense that I try and
work with the people that inspire me
right so reposition my offer to
marketing Consulting with which is
pretty much the same thing where I'm
helping them with web design funnels
copywriting all the things that go into
that for a service business but I
offered Consulting rather than
freelancing simply because I'm a Creator
and I knew they were a Creator and since
they're a one-person business I
understand that they want to do it on
their own right that offer would be more
profitable than me doing it for them
because I would just be teaching them
but I I didn't only talk about my
marketing Consulting right or marketing
or funnels or web design I talked about
whatever I wanted to in a way that was
interesting to other people in other
words I had to introduce them to the
importance of the topic I wanted to talk
about in order for them to understand if
I wanted to talk about emotional
management I would if I wanted to talk
about Fitness and Nutrition I would if I
wanted to post an aspirational piece of
content I would eighty percent of my
content did not revolve around the thing
that I was selling and it didn't matter
why would it if I can be interested in
both Fitness and business so can other
people other people can have the exact
same interests as me and even if they
don't have those interests then I write
a tweet where we're gonna go about that
over this in two videos from now where I
write content with you in the video
self-awareness as a whole is like the
biggest business hack right because you
have to think about how you would
actually view content like do you only
follow business people do you only
follow Fitness people
it just doesn't make sense when you
actually think about your own actions if
something shows up on my feed about
Fitness I feel like anyone can become
interested in Fitness if it is the right
tweet right that's the entire challenge
is how do I introduce you to the
importance of a topic like Fitness so I
could say
10 reasons you need to get into the gym
that applies to anyone and if the
reasons are good then it's shareable
people are going to follow you and then
if you want to talk about business and
you go here's 10 reasons to start a
one-person business it's the same thing
right you have to start Broad and
beginner level and then that's top of
funnel social media that's how you grow
and then once you get them into your
newsletter or into your lead Magnet or
some other kind of funnel that educates
them in alignment with the service that
you have to offer that's where the sales
come from right because you aren't and
shouldn't be promoting in all of your
content it just doesn't make sense to do
that and if you can create a system that
bakes in promotions then you have much
more free space in your mind to talk
about whatever you want right so if I
want to sell a product or service here's
exactly what I would do first talk about
whatever I want in an interesting way
that leads to growth two craft a three
week long strategy based on the topics
and the product or service this builds
Authority and it's what I'm doing right
now with solopreneur Sprints right pay
attention did I talk about business in
the last letter or did I talk about
whatever I wanted the third is start
beginner level for the sake of customer
awareness and increase to Advanced as it
gets closer to launch right long medium
and short form content from the top down
the promotions write themselves and then
the fifth systemize what worked and
incorporate promotions throughout the
week to keep sales high like bi-weekly
threads on a topic around you offer so
if I offer web design and let's say I
talk about whatever I want Fitness
business self-improvement philosophy
anything throughout the week every
single Tuesday and Thursday I write a
web design and business specific thread
right and at the bottom of that thread I
have a promotion of my offer I can
that's a system that I can milk
endlessly and if those threads are good
and they tackle a common problem they
give value like you understand
persuasion that's how you make sales
alright so let's create your niche of
one or the niche of you here's a graphic
you are the niche let's look at this
because this is important on the left we
have the start of a story then the highs
and lows associated with it so people
have the desire to change and that is
around where your customer is right now
and then when you add the desire to
change you had to learn educate yourself
acquire skills and actually take action
to gain experience that you can teach
other people and that entire Journey
represents your unique path in life that
you that's what content ideas are and
then upwards where it says you are here
you see how you're just a bit ahead of
your potential customer or a follower
and then you are working towards your
ideal future and now your ideal future
is not marketing web design or some
hyper-specific Niche right it is very
big broad I'm sure it resembles the good
life and that is unique to every single
individual and how you are going to
achieve that good life is unique to you
are are you going to study spirituality
maybe you like philosophy more what part
of philosophy do you like stoicism uh
what are the other things what kind of
business model are you going to talk
about right is it going to be a Creator
business is it going to be a freelance
agency e-commerce what's it going to
 be next Health everyone needs
health health wealth relationships so
are you going to talk about health every
now and then because in your future your
ideal future you want to have high
energy so that you can put effort into
your business so what are you doing
health related to do that and how can
you incorporate that in your content to
make you stand out from other people
because you already have the systemized
promotions in place to sell your offer
and monetize so from a spiritual or
philosophical lens your brand is
yourself right it is a concept and that
brand can be an outcome of a repetitive
business ideology that has been
conditioned into your head so if you've
only been studying freelancing and
haven't dug into like Facebook ads
Agency for example and brought in your
perspective to collect that collect
aspects of that perspective and bring it
into your world view then you're gonna
it's gonna end in a lot of pain and
suffering because you're gonna think
your business model is the best just
like religions do or even sports teams
do and you need to take a step back zoom
out and create your brand as something
unique as something that is you without
attaching to any specific ideology and
instead creating a holistic Philosophy
for your own brand so let's walk through
how to recreate yourself
as a brand first is map your ideal
future how is your story going to end
will it result in peace health and
fulfilling work or do you have no idea
how it's going to end up your story is
what separates your personal brand apart
because every single person's story is
Niche individual and unique and if you
don't have a vision for the future one
watch the society is a pyramid scheme
video I believe so but if you don't have
a vision for your future how are you
going to educate and execute in a
conducive manner towards that Vision are
we going to take directional action in
order to gain experience in life and
pass that experience down second is
intelligent imitation when you take
stuff from one writer it's plagiarism
but when you take from many writers it's
called research that is a well-known
quote from Wilson Mizner but it's the
whole steal like an artist thing so my
voice or tone or message is a
combination of the voice tone or message
that I like from other people right I
read books and I figure out I like how
this guy said this one thing I'm gonna
take that or at least take note of it
and then practice it later or hmm I like
how this guy talks about flow I want to
talk about that too or like on the flip
side too we've talked about anti-vision
and vision before and having like a good
and bad thing to observe and allow you
to choose or make the right decision
accordingly but if I see something that
I don't like where it's like I don't
like how this guy's writing it sounds
too like Airy fairy I get that from The
Power of Now I love that book but I want
to be able to distill those Concepts to
the people that don't really resonate
with the way that he's saying it right I
need to come at it a different way in
order to attract a new audience to that
very life-changing message and so the
same it's the same with everything it's
not only my voice but my brand what
colors do I like uh what are like minor
button details on my website like the
rounded edges it's everything that's
what creativity is it's either taking
one thing like an idea and then
deconstructing it into parts and then
reconstructing it like mental Legos or
it's taking those parts from other
people and then reconstructing them into
your own so this works for anything but
here's what you're gonna do write down
the books that impacted you the most
write down the creators authors or
public figures whose style you love the
most immerse yourself in their work
condition your mind to think in that
style write down their tone voice and
what makes them great research their
products landing pages and every detail
about how they make an income in short
create a tribe of mentors and
exclusively consume their content you
won't have to copy them directly if
you're so immersed in their work that
your subconscious
bursts original ideas for you from those
things right you'll notice that you
naturally start to talk in that way so
the third thing is book to Brand content
the path of the problem solver or value
Creator is how you escape the world of
replaceability fall in love with the
challenge that problems present from
superficial to metaphysical and your
ideal future will create itself this is
the infinite game so every story has an
ideal outcome or a goal and then on the
path to that call Goal there are a
series of highs lows emotions battles
mistakes and solutions to the problems
that you find along the way to be
systemized so here's how you turn your
brand or yourself into a niche that
houses your content products or Services
treat your ideal future as the end goal
of the story make note of your past
there are a select few pivotal moments
that can be your starting point of the
book write down an outline of the book
what are the chapters that must be
included to reach the end goal outline
key points for each of those chapters
seriously do this this is book to Brand
you take a book you map the ideal
outcome of your future right that's the
angle point a is where you are now or
one of those pivotal points in your life
that made you want to change and then in
between those are chapters and sub
chapters and those act as your content
ideas right and then you fill them in by
writing newsletters condense those into
threads condense the threads into posts
like tweets Instagram reels tick tocks
whatever it may be and then over time
let's say you want to write a book like
I am this is exactly what I'm doing for
my content and this won't be immediate
you're not just going to write out the
chapters all at once you're going to
write down two or three but then you
have some form of an outline and then
you have something that will allow new
ideas and experiences to register in
your awareness and you'll be able to
connect it to that outline and come back
and start filling it in as you
experience life read books read content
from your tribe of mentors that you
created
etc etc so number four is to write your
story so your story is what makes you
unique and relatable and if you've been
paying attention you can see at the very
start of this video I started with a
personal experience around a topic that
I wanted to talk about in order to frame
the situation my six figure ads agency
course that I bought I'm sure that was
quite relatable with a lot of you
because the the story and the relatable
aspects of a story give people hope and
makes them aware of the possibility that
it is possible to overcome the low point
in life that they're in or to take
advantage and double down on the high
point so we we just talked about this
but for the sake of repetition because
it's important
write the sections of each chapter as an
article or newsletter repurpose that
writing into a podcast or YouTube video
condense the main points into a thread
Carousel or LinkedIn post rewrite those
main points as engaging tweets turn
those tweets into real scripts and posts
for other platforms this process gives
you a multi-dimensional understanding of
the topic that you are writing about
right because a tweet is a big idea it's
not super actionable it can be but an
article you're fleshing out so much more
you're connecting different ideas and as
you do this this will change your life
over six months right I have so many
 reasons to tell you guys to
start a personal brand and that's all my
videos are it's like hey here's all the
reasons start one already because I
genuinely I genuinely don't think that a
Creator is a business model it's a life
philosophy right just apply to the
internet and another thing is that if
you remember the best ways to learn from
my video learn new skills fast teaching
is one of them right everyone's afraid
to teach when teaching is how you learn
you don't have to lie you just be honest
like hey I learned this today how
interesting is this or if you do
something like why should you start a
one-person business just give off your
honest experience in a bullet point list
it's like no one's stopping you but
yourself from writing and producing some
form of value in the world so number
five is when in doubt zoom out two steps
to happiness zoom in on what's important
zoom out from everything else the
solution to struggle is perspective this
journey is difficult you will struggle
to articulate your Niche because nobody
wants to put themselves in a box and so
for now I'm just putting it on your
radar that you can completely you can
completely forget the traditional Niche
down advice of choosing like the most
profitable Market with someone that you
don't want to work with in any capacity
using a skill that you don't want to use
in any capacity you can create your own
Niche and if this is a problem like if
you can't fully understand this yet
that's a good thing so what I would
recommend you do because the reason it's
not making sense to you and you lack
understanding is because you let's say
there's a DOT here and there's a DOT
here and you're missing the dot here
that allows those to connect and give
you that aha moment in your mind right
so you lack experience so what you need
to do is start anyway immerse yourself
in information that has the potential to
solve that problem read books buy
courses buy listen to podcasts just
immerse yourself in the information
drown yourself in the information to the
point where when you off and do
nothing or you zoom out or you go on a
walk then ideas won't stop coming to
your brain and things will start to make
sense because your subconscious mind is
working to solve that problem so that is
it for this video the most profitable
Niche is you so if you enjoyed the video
