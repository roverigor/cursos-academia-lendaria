the state of work is changing things are
going digital we know that employers are
starting to hire based on an
individual's public resume that they
post online via content newsletters
YouTube videos or anything else that
helps display their credibility and
Authority without you having to try and
prove it to the employer and to add on
top of that people are and have been
losing trust in the traditional
education system and they are resorting
to internet creators for their future
success both personal and professional
because think about it when's the last
time that you've heard someone say like
oh I am so proud like I use everything
that I learned in my degree for my job
that's not how things are moving instead
I've learned what I know about the gym
from YouTubers that talk about Fitness
there are infinite perspectives that I
can study and become my own personal
trainer and my own personal expert
rather than I don't have to give that
advice to others I can if that's
something I want to do and I do for
business and spirituality and personal
development but when it comes to the gym
and health I have the full ability to
tap into my desire for self-education
and I can become my own personal trainer
I can become my own relationship
therapist I can become my own
psychologist I can become anything that
I want to become because there is ample
education out there that I don't have to
shovel over forty thousand dollars to
acquire to become an expert in that
field and now client work like
freelancing when they want to break out
of this traditional system of like
either employment or other things people
usually go with the freelancing option
they learn a skill they sell a skill and
they get stuck in a new Rat Race that
they have created for themselves in
terms of I need to find clients in order
to survive and and they're going to pay
me this much and you're a commodity
because you're a specialized robot that
performs one specific task that other
tools are starting to automate out
because that's the thing is one thing
that a lot of people leave out about
freelancing or what they don't tell you
because I've experienced it and some
people are starting to talk about this
but I was a freelancer and I pivoted out
of it because I realized that you need
to truly become an expert and that does
not mean being a specialist if you want
to become a web designer great that is
an incredible first option to go with to
start making some money but in order to
charge three four five ten thousand
dollars for a service to be able to
generate wealth and be able to take on
less clients so you have more time on
your hands you have to understand that
the the low ticket freelance jobs are
being automated out I can go and build
an absolutely beautiful website
for ten dollars with a specific software
because that's what web designers are
doing nowadays is they are using
software and they're using their mind
and their creative ability to apply that
software to someone else's business and
because that business usually doesn't
have the time to do so for themselves
and now I'm a big proponent of the one
person business model and so if you're
coming into the Creator economy or even
for like influencers and you're trying
to sell to these people because it's the
future and that's what you should do and
it's an opportunity that you should hop
on I'm not saying this lightly please
note this down is that if you want to
Target other creators and become a
Creator yourself you're going to have to
go more towards the side of Education
right if you were to come to me I don't
want a website built for myself I want
to learn how to do it so you can either
teach me or I can go buy a software and
learn how to do it myself but in many
cases says I don't want to spend that
time to learn how to do this one
specific thing just because it doesn't
interest me so I would rather pay you a
thousand dollars to get on a call with
me and tell me exactly how to build a
website I don't need this don't reach
out to me for this I was a web designer
in my past I can do that specifically
fine but if you find a problem in my
business that I'm unaware of and you
make me aware of it and you persuade me
as to why it's going to help my business
for me to pay you a thousand dollars to
teach me that step-by-step system that
will save me x amount of time wasted
than I may buy from you and so the
highest paid Freelancers
that do the work for you they use their
creative ability they use their mind
they don't rely on a software with cool
templates and other things to be the
main part of their service they
understand a mix a range of skills that
then they can come and build a solution
for your business so for example if I'm
having if a Coach is having trouble
generating leads then I'm going to come
in and I'm going to say okay you need a
landing page so I need to know web
design you need uh copywriting for that
landing page so I need to understand
persuasion marketing and copywriting and
then I need to understand their business
as a whole right because then they opt
in and they get put into an email
sequence that has follow-ups and other
things and that's a much better
well-rounded service that fits someone's
specific business in a way that will get
results and that is impossible to just
Outsource to one specific software to do
it all for you and so as humans this is
what we do we have the ability to think
and build we build tools and solutions
that make life easier for us this is
never going to stop we're going to
continue doing it so if you are not a
builder then you are going to be built
over or you are going to build for
someone else so that was kind of just an
introduction to lay the framework but in
the last video we talked about the one
person business model how to productize
yourself and now I want to talk about
what I call a value Creator or in some
cases a synthesizer which we'll also
touch on but the value Creator is a way
to go about the one person business
model because there are infinite numbers
of one-person business models right it's
not limited to digital products
information products courses coaching
Consulting like turning yourself into a
business is what I'm talking about here
and being a value Creator is a way of
doing that so this is a new career path
that the internet has created I've
talked about how sixty percent of new
jobs have yet to be created they're
going to be created by the internet the
value Creator or the educator is going
to be one of them one that takes it on
as their responsibility to research a
specific crevice of reality that nobody
has explored or at least explored in
that combination right you can explore
many different interests and then you
synthesize those you connect those and
you educate other people you play your
role in the
shift away from the traditional
education system that can't keep up with
how technology has evolved so value
creators are the people that earn with
their mind not their time so they can
stay as a one-person Business Without
limiting their income they research
their obsessions and distill their
learnings with writing video and other
internet content they become a
one-person media company right they
build their name on social media with
media so videos writing graphics and
then they sell a product from that
traffic right because now you have
traffic now you need a way to monetize
and send people to and we talked about
that in the last video third thing they
get paid for aggregated knowledge and
experience in the form of digital
products or physical products if you
want but everyone should have some form
of digital product so that's how they
get paid is they research these things
they leave out breadcrumbs in the form
of content and media and then they
aggregate that information into a
step-by-step system and sell that via
digital a digital product or service and
four they have a heavy focus on
educating Their audience instead of
posting memes starting drama
commentating on other things or other
things like that to me this is very
appealing I like the path of the value
creator online because I don't have to
worry about starting drama with other
people I get to focus on my Med my
message and what I'm educating people on
and it doesn't take flashy looks or
other things to actually build an
audience it takes this education of the
certain things that you are learning and
becoming an expert in so value creators
are those that dedicate themselves to
exploring the unknown aspects of life to
exploring their curiosity and they take
it on as their life work life's work to
dissect these crevices of reality that
they're exploring so whether it be
self-improvement marketing business
spirituality metaphysics philosophy
email marketing whatever it may be you
just have to start and start learning
and connections and letting one thing
lead to another by curiosity now a lot
of people get confused here with
curiosity and so do I because it's not
something tangible it's not something
concrete and for me I can only explain
it based off of experience and feeling
so with curiosity think of the book that
you actually wanted to read think of the
videos that you actually wanted to watch
the things that were seamless where it's
like man I'm loving learning about this
so for me it's a select few books it's
like The Power of Now which I haven't
read in a bit awareness way of the
superior man
Flow by mihai chicks at me high uh Rest
by Alex tsujung kimpong and everything
Alan Watts right those really resonate
with me specifically they may not
resonate with you and that's a sign
that's a sign that you have to find the
people in the writing and the interest
that really really resonate with you and
that makes it effortless to actually
study those and makes you want to talk
about them because if you're going to
post something online the easiest way I
can say as to oh what do I post post the
things that are interesting to you
because they're going to be interesting
to someone else if you're reading
through a book and something catches
your attention and you're like oh man
that's really good other people aren't
going to think that some other people so
you take that and you distill it for
your audience you synthesize it with
your interests or what you're trying to
achieve in this life watch the other
video
on the one person business model and
then that's going to be interesting to
them because they are similar to you so
it's not about transitioning from
consumer to Creator it's about
transitioning from consumer to
researcher first because you have to
research and gather your own knowledge
before you can create with it right you
have to dissect other things via reading
and then order to reconstruct them into
your own creation or writing or video or
newsletter or whatever it may be because
a researcher to me implies that you are
intentionally consuming information you
have a goal of how to use that
information and apply that information
so if your brand or you as a person are
working towards a big goal in your life
and you're researching specific things
let's say you're working towards
Financial Freedom but you're very
interested in spirituality well how is
it helping you get there right that's a
very unique perspective and that's a
very unique connection that you can make
so here's a graphic of the value Creator
we start with genuine interests and the
skills you need for that are research
learning and note taking those are
things you have to do on a daily basis
so what are you obsessed with learning
we talked about that the next thing is
creating your unique perspective if you
need help with this I highly highly
highly recommend you download my free
creative challenges called seven days to
genius ideas it it will change
everything I don't say that in a
platitude sense like oh it'll change
your life it will change the way
you see the world the world and your
content it'll Branch over into content
so for forming a unique perspective you
need critical thinking open-mindedness
and self-improvement next thing is
actually creating value from that so how
will they help others reach that goal
how will your unique interests and
perspectives help other people and for
that the skills you need are marketing
and sales writing and thinking education
and teaching and then now that you have
value because you understand how to
structure a persuasive message by
studying those skills then you need to
distribute that value so the next thing
is value dis distribution where can they
find your value on the internet so you
need to understand social media
digital tools and leverage building and
so if you have to screenshot that
graphic and start just generally
researching those skills get the big
picture of what they are and how to do
them well because here's one other thing
right I was watching in actualize.org
lecture the other day and he mentioned
how like real or
like the school system and government
and other things they're
compartmentalized right when you go to
school to be learn one thing let's say
the biology department or the chemistry
department or the business department
right you're you're limited you're
studying those things only when reality
is not compartmentalized business
it it's a part of life all of your life
plays into it and we need more people we
need more synthesizers to come in and
research their interests and use that to
create an entirely new category because
like life isn't compartmentalized you
need to be able to understand the full
picture and connect the full picture
together in order to help people achieve
their goals in life we need more people
that can do that because because it
isn't easy it's incredibly difficult and
fun to research what you want to
research and embrace the unknown or the
unconventional and uncomfortable path in
life it is 10 times more rewarding any
platitude will tell you that and those
platitudes the cliche quotes on like oh
break out of your comfort zone like
they're they've lived a long time
because they're very very very important
no matter how many times they've been
conditioned into your head to the point
of you thinking that they are boring and
insignificant so this how this all
sounds great but how do you start
researching your interests effectively
and that is by exploring the unknown
aspects of reality through Consciousness
because reality is infinitely complex
connected and perspective based you are
a perspective vessel the way that you
consume information is going to be
different from how others consume it you
are going to interpret it based on your
world view and then if you create with
that worldview and you help put it out
there then it's going to be different
from other people's perspectives so how
do you explore this crevice of reality
or part of the unknown you deconstruct
holes into parts then you reconstruct
those parts back into a hole because the
universe or God or infinite intelligence
or whatever it may be it has divided
itself into Infinite different parts it
is a whole and it is a part and those
parts exist because of distinctions
right it's just infinite different
distinctions and I don't want to get all
filled philosophical here we'll dive
into that in another time but you have
to understand that the only thing the
only reason that people or things exist
like in the metaphor in the
philosophical sense the only reason they
exist is because of relationship it's
because of Distinction it's because I am
not this so I am this right I am not
that camera so I am human being I am not
like if nothing if you're just floating
in a void you yourself would cease to
exist because you have nothing to
compare it to so let's make this a bit
more practical so the first step is
choose an obsession and the with this
don't try to Outsource this you can't
just be like what's my obsession I don't
know what is your obsession have you
tried anything have you gotten pulled
down a rabbit hole before like you have
to try a bunch of different things if
you don't know try if you don't try
you'll never know so try literally
everything that potentially catches your
interest because your mind your ego will
try to distract you from this if you see
something like oh will that be cool to
study or learn on my own but that video
game that sounds really nice oh that
like going out with my friends that
sounds really nice I have nothing
against video games or going out with
your friends but if it's distracting you
from making progress then yeah there's a
problem there so if you need a starting
point look at your browser history on
YouTube Google whatever it may be look
at the last videos you watched and look
at what you naturally consume to learn
not to distract yourself what do you go
on social media to learn who are you
following that are actually educating
others and how can you emulate them how
can you reverse engineer how can you
deconstruct that hole into Parts how can
you you reverse engineer their success
and follow it and another thing is to
look at your life and see what you do
what have you improved the most in your
life if you're a gem junkie how has the
gym helped you if you're a runner how
has that helped you if you're an auto
Didact or polymath and you just love
researching everything how has that
helped you how can you help other people
become that and how has it benefited
your life so number two is to research
that Obsession from all angles so to do
this you have to follow people that you
disagree with that are talking about
your topic of interest you have to buy
let's say a best-selling book that goes
over the fundamentals of that Obsession
you need to get the big picture before
you can start understanding the tactics
and the little details right you have to
obsess over the big picture rather than
the technical details don't get trapped
in the technical details
view everything from The Meta
perspective of the big picture of that
specific Obsession of yours the thing
that you are researching and you have to
come at it from I want to understand
this holistically I want to understand
all perspectives if you're a health guy
then study the benefits of a vegan diet
even if you absolutely hate and you're
tied to the ideology that veganism is
bad look at the benefits see why people
do it be able to be nuanced and navigate
your way through a conversation on
health and then go and look at carnivore
if you are so attached to carnivore then
force yourself to look at the research
that disproves carnivore and vice versa
for everything look at both sides of the
coin if you're attached to the ancestral
diet then maybe try veganism like break
out of your little bubble of comfort
that you put yourself in and continue
growing by trying new things and
researching the entire domain so the
best thing you can do is just learn
about it every day and immerse yourself
in that Obsession and people that are
teaching about it unfollow every single
social media account aside from the ones
that are putting out good information
that you can study put books on your
desk a cue a podcast for the next day
literally just immerse yourself in the
information and then the next thing that
you do is you note down Golden Nugget
ideas or your discoveries so as you're
researching your obsessions or really
anything it should be since you are
genuinely curious about these things it
should be near impossible to not write
down your discoveries or to write down
the things that really stuck with you
the things that interested you meaning
they are going to interest someone else
so if you need help one keep a running
note in your phone and download my free
creative challenge so I give all of this
to you but if you need help as you're
listening as you're reading whatever it
may be note down the ideas anecdotes
stories or even statistics that really
stuck out to you that you're like wow
like that changed my mind or aha like
that's it it's hard to put this into
like tangible words because you can't
but when you get that excitement that's
what you write down and so with all of
this when you go to write content or you
go to create a video where you go to
outline a podcast or something like that
all of these things that you've written
down they're building blocks you
literally just copy paste them over and
you structure an argument about based on
what you want to talk about and these
will serve as foundational ideas for
your content like one thing that I do
for my YouTube videos is one I watch
Good YouTube videos and I know what
performs well in the algorithm and I
take the title of the video so let's say
one that's coming in the future that I'm
writing about in my newsletter right now
is called the power of being alone
that's a very hot topic a lot of people
like to talk about that so right now
what I'm doing is I'm listening to
videos on being alone I'm studying that
topic so I can come with a credible
argument because I have experience
variance to back it but I need a way of
structuring my argument and so that's
the next thing is that simplifying
complex topics will be the greatest
skill of The Next Century because we
live in an information age right there's
so many ideas and people are overwhelmed
with what they need to do right there's
so many different options that you can
take for your career or your life and we
need people that can come and organize
and simplify this information that's
being put out there because people are
making new discoveries left and right
people are creating new knowledge left
and right and they're distilling it in
the form of Internet content and so the
biggest mistake you can do here because
you're researching your interest right
you're researching you're noting things
down but the worst thing you can do is
let knowledge outpace execution you have
to apply what you learn because you
don't learn to write by reading about
writing it's going to help it's a good
guide but you have to actually practice
it right you can't study a a seniors
level English course if you're in first
grade right or you haven't written
anything in your life it just doesn't
make sense it's not going to apply and
you're going to be like oh crap and you
need to go back to the fundamentals you
need to go back to first grade English
and practice and then you're going to
need to go to second grade English and
then practice you need go to third grade
English and practice and if you skip any
of those steps you're not going to learn
to write effectively or it's just going
to take you 10 times longer because
you're going to try and write like a
senior in college and then you're going
to have to go back to fourth grade but
there's also a trap there because with
value creation you need to make your
knowledge valuable right there's only so
many things that you can like practice
tangibly right there's ideas that you
have to munch on and contemplate and go
on walks and let your default mode
Network let your subconscious mind bring
ideas to your conscious mind so you have
Firepower to write with you have to sit
down and you have to sit with a topic
and just think about it you have to
contemplate you have to go in you need
to introspect and self-reflect and
understand like okay what is the true
value in this message what has this
helped me with in my life and now the
next step is absolutely crucial you need
to put your value on the public market
so you need to turn the value that
you've created into internet content and
you need to post it because you need
data you need to understand if your
ideas are truly valuable or not or if
they are perceived as valuable because
you can write like Alan Watts you can
write like a philosopher but if you post
it online and you're not growing and
you're not getting any engagement and
because of that you're not making any
sales it's not going to be sustainable
then how are you going to do that for a
full time you need a balance of internal
and external you need to play the game
the external game from a place of I want
to give value okay so we understand how
to find and research our obsessions but
how do we package up that knowledge and
turn it into something of value that
other people will like engage and follow
along with so the first step is choosing
a media platform because you're going to
be Distributing your value via media
right you're going to be composing a
message from your knowledge from your
own unique perspective and distribute it
via media that's all the internet is
right that's how you reach anyone that's
how you build a readership that's how
you build an audience there is no way
around it you have to create content you
have to create media so I personally
prefer Twitter that's what I started
with that's what many people in my
network have started with they've grown
on there because it is underrated and
untapped and there are just so many
different benefits starting on Twitter
because I tried everything before I
tried a fitness YouTube channel I tried
a digital art page on Instagram I tried
paid ads SEO all of this other stuff to
try and grow my brand and now I was
missing crucial pieces but when I got on
Twitter everything just clicked all of
my knowledge clicked and I'm just like
okay I know how to make this work now
and it was easier because Twitter you
need a profile picture but you don't
need to post any images right it's it's
an idea platform it's a platform for
ideas and writing clear articulation and
communication that's what all of this is
that's the foundation of everything
there's a reason that people screenshot
their tweets and post them on other
platforms it's because the message is so
valuable and uh captivating compared to
like an Instagram model that's just in
like a bikini there's something of value
there and those tweets the screenshotted
tweets on any other platform usually get
more engagement
if the Tweet is good then any other kind
of post you could post right so it only
makes sense to start on Twitter because
all you need is the ability to type on a
keyboard and maybe some branding and
marketing knowledge on how to create a
profile that makes people want to follow
you right but that's not the only
benefit of starting on Twitter the other
thing is that the retweet button that's
how you share a post that's how you get
eyes that's how you get eyes on your
content which is how you grow you like I
feel like people are so confused with
how to grow it's like I'm posting
content every single day and it's like
this isn't YouTube where those are going
to build up and over time if the SEO is
good then you may gain a following this
is you need to write good content and
you need to put 100 of your effort 90 of
your effort on getting it in front of
other people and so the retweet button
is just a click on any other social
media platform it's much higher friction
to share another post it's much higher
friction to get eyes on your post
therefore getting them on your profile
therefore having them follow you so take
that into account and the comments right
the comments are just better on Twitter
it's more of a forum and people go to
the comments more than they would on say
Instagram right so if you're commenting
on Instagram all you see is like a
username and then a line with whatever
they're commenting but if you comment on
Twitter they see your profile picture so
they can tell if you're a Creator or not
if your branding is good they see your
name and they see that you added value
to that tweet so there's just much
easier ways to grow on Twitter and
Twitter's just underrated and it it is a
foundation writing is the foundation of
everything if you can write compelling
tweets all of your other social media
content will get that much better and
that much more valuable so the key with
this is to start with beginner level
content 95 of the market are beginners
if you're watching this
feels weird to say this but you're a bit
higher intelligence like I try to not
make things super shallow so you're at
least looking for depth you are ahead of
people in some area whether it be from
what I taught you or from what someone
else on YouTube taught you you have
information that you can pass down to a
beginner level like very beginner level
right in the form of actionable advice
that's what every single person does to
grow at the start YouTubers for example
if you want to become a vlogger go look
at a vlogger's past videos did they
start with just these random Vlogs where
it's like I bought a new car it's like
no they taught you something they
educated you and provided value relating
to something from a beginner level so if
they are uh mainly a health guy then
they'd post it all of the flat
foundations and fundamentals of
what they do to maintain their health or
build muscle or lose fat or whatever it
may be the same is for writing how do
you get started writing what's the
benefits of writing what are the
foundational principles of writing what
about persuasive communication right you
need to dissect and understand the
certain interests that you are pursuing
and dish out actionable advice in the
form of the fundamentals in order to
grow at the start that is the content
that you are going to be producing on
Twitter and just be aware of this when
you're scrolling on Twitter or Instagram
don't just scroll and consume the
content that's the consumer mindset the
Creator it he takes it he looks at it he
deconstructs it why did this do so well
why is this type of content performing
well and if this content is performing
well how am I going to take whatever it
is here the essence of this post make it
my own so I can also grow and play the
game so that's step number one is choose
a media platform and just start posting
step number two is to learn to capture
attention because that is the name of
the game in just this information age
this idea age where there's too much
information there's too many ideas
everyone's trying to catch your
attention but that's the thing is you
have to get good at catching attention
or else they're not going to read any of
your stuff if you can't stop them to
read your post how are they going to
like your post how are they going to
retweet it how are they going to comment
how are they going to click on your
profile to try and find out more how are
you going to catch their attention on
your profile how are you going to lead
that attention to your lead magnet what
about your emails what about
a product what about a service how are
you going to guide their attention
throughout all of this but the thing
here is you don't have to become a
sleazy used car salesman to catch
attention it's like but wait there's
more no you don't have to do any of that
 you just have to understand and
study psychology and I'll give you a few
examples of
like how to capture attention based on
psychological principles so the first is
problems right if you have studied
marketing if you studied copywriting if
you studied branding everything revolves
around problems human behavior revolves
around problems stories start with
problems right if you start with a
problem it opens a curiosity Gap and
they want to figure out what the
solution is right so if you can start
with a problem that a relatable problem
that someone is facing like if you
struggle to grow your business that's
just an example but a problem right it's
The Duality and the like back and forth
and playing the game of problems and
benefits right so what's the problem how
do you overcome it what are the benefits
the problem is a good way of capturing
attention and this all takes practice so
another one is numbers numbers like a
statistic well that's the next one I
want to go over but uh numbers where
it's like I spent 4 500 hours studying
this so you don't have to here's what I
learned right something like that
numbers especially on Twitter or even
other platforms where it's very text
heavy or image heavy it's just a
different thing it's a pattern interrupt
that catches someone's attention and
then the next thing is statistics so 99
of people say they regretted something
before they died how do you avoid this
right so you can see how that kind of
leads into something else but you're
you're better off studying
um copywriting for this like sales
copywriting or persuasive copywriting
you can get my two-hour writer course I
go over all of this in so much more
depth it's it's like it's so hard to go
over in this video that's why I created
a course but that will give you
everything you need to know if you want
something else to study for free look up
Ada Aida copywriting framework that'll
give you that's a very basic one but
it's very useful especially for tweets
um Pastor
p-a-s-t-o-r that is also a copywriting
framework that is more along form that
will help you write like Instagram
captions emails sales Pages landing
pages all of this other stuff and give
you like a structure of the sales
process that's another thing you can
research is the sales process so we've
chosen a media platform we understand
that we have to learn how to capture
attention the next thing is to treat
yourself as your ideal reader if you
watch the last video on the one person
business model you know that I'm very
big or trying to create something out of
this I'm trying to come up with a term
if you can think of a term for this I've
thought of like mental monetization the
business of self one person business is
good but that's kind of broad there's
nothing specific that's like I'm turning
myself into a business I'm productizing
myself I want a name for that but that's
just the thing while you are your brand
you are your content you are whatever I
want you to treat yourself as your ideal
reader your writing or creating value
for yourself both your past self where
you're giving them advice on how to to
overcome problems faster or you're just
like giving them encouragement you
remember uh like if you can sit back and
contemplate and think this is very big
for Value creators is Solitude and
thinking and free Thinking by
going on walks listening to what you
want to listen to contemplating
self-reflecting all of that stuff
because when you self-reflect and you
remember that you were in a low place in
life then you can write to that person
you can create for that person where you
are saying like this is like a Cheesy
motivational example but it's like hey
man I know you're in a hard place
I know you can get past this just keep
doing what you're doing it's a Cheesy
aspect but if if you were like I
remember when I didn't understand this
thing in marketing and now you
understand marketing then give them
advice like here are the the five
marketing principles that you need to
understand catching attention
creating value whatever it may be and
then you list them off and that's how
you can start creating content and you
can also do it to your current self if
you're going to through a hard time
right now then give yourself advice tell
yourself what to do to overcome that and
other people will benefit from it right
this is a great way of just like
personal growth in general I mentioned
in the last video that business and
writing and content creation is my
method the is my tool as opposed to like
meditation for self-actualizing and
self-transending and then you can so on
the flip side if you're not in a bad
place right now if you're in a very good
place and things are going well then
tell people why tell yourself why it's
going well and reinforce that in your
own head write to yourself to reinforce
your own good behavior and to try and
fix your bad behavior then you can also
write to your future self of like give
them uh encouragement to keep going or
something like that you get the point so
in essence you treat Twitter or even
just social media in general as your
public Journal you treat it as your
public note taking software you treat it
as your public journal and you treat it
as your public school for other people
so the fourth thing we understand we
chose media platform capturing attention
writing to ourselves but now you have to
prioritize depth and Clarity because so
many people just get trapped they get
trapped in the social media rat race
right they get out of the corporate Rat
Race for the social media Rat Race where
they're just so focused on growth
they're so focused on oh I have to write
this kind of content in order to grow
and that's true to an extent you do have
to grow and you do have to kind of shut
your ego off and provide value to those
that actually need it even though you
think you're too above that level of
knowledge but the other thing is that
you need to actually you have to write
you have to write and dissect and create
depth behind the things that you're
truly passionate about because that is
how you become an expert so I recommend
starting a newsletter right everyone
should if you don't have an email list
you're just gonna be screwed you're
going to be absolutely if your
social media platforms get taken down
they can't take emails away from you
email marketing don't let any limiting
beliefs or whatever like oh nobody
checks their emails and it's like no
they do people are making seven figures
from email lists alone uh you have to
test it out and experience it to know
for yourself but for now start an email
newsletter right I go over this into our
writer again my writing course and just
content creation course but for the
newsletter this has been the biggest
game changer for me in my business is
one noting all of these things so I I
told you about the seven days to genius
ideas challenge where you kind of pick
that Golden Nugget of information that
you picked up from researching your
obsessions and then you write that down
and then as you're writing those down
you have building blocks for the
newsletters right so you take a topic
that you want to write about you dissect
it with my framework where you break it
into goals benefits perspectives topics
whatever and then you start piecing
together a newsletter and you start
making connections right now if you want
to get very spiritual
um actualize.org he actually has a clip
it's called love is connection so love
not the the uh not the ooey gooey modern
notion of love but like love for like
Selfless Love right Selfless Love for
everything is connection it's finding
that shared perspective it's connecting
the dots and seeing how reality moves
together and that's really what has
changed the game for me with my
newsletter it's like I study
neuroscience and I study philosophy and
I'm like these are saying the same
things how can I put this together in a
newsletter and that forces me to be able
to articulate these things this is
what's helped me so much with YouTube
videos is that my thoughts are actually
clear now because I'm taking notes on
things I'm dissecting them I'm fleshing
them out I'm writing them in my own
words I've been writing for a long time
so that's another advantage of mine but
then I'm able to articulate things just
so much better like you go and watch a
YouTube video from even six months ago
let's say like eight months ago they
were nowhere near this level of just
articulation like it can happen that
fast if you then dedicate yourself to
creating valuable long-form content and
opting out of the short form content Rat
Race while still maintaining that and
systemizing that so you can grow but
most of the value and sales are going to
come from nurturing your audience in
your newsletter and then that newsletter
can be taken and turned into a YouTube
video a podcast
or really however else you want to
deconstruct it because you're creating
all this value and then you can turn
certain points into tweets and all of
this other stuff so the gist of it is is
that becoming a value creator
that may be my name for all of this
becoming a value Creator is a very
viable and purposeful career path I feel
like I've been working towards becoming
this myself for my entire life and I
just didn't know what it was
um or that it was a possibility or other
things like that and it really is if you
stick it out and you stay consistent and
you're not going to know what you're
doing for majority of the time I still
don't know what the I'm doing it's
like yeah I'm in a much better place
financially mentally and physically but
it's not like you have a vision for your
future which is important it's not like
you have a vision for your future and
then you get there one day and you're
like I achieved it all it's like nope
we're you feel the same I'm in the same
human body I have the same human senses
and perceptions and I'm just at a better
place I'm much more calm
um I'm much more stable I'm not acting
out of survival as much and
I I really attribute a lot of that to
just writing and creating value not only
for myself but for others and having
everyone benefit from it and it's been
such like a personal growth journey in
itself so I would recommend that I would
say try it out right as as with the
obsession things like try it out stick
out that initial like period where you
don't know what you're doing right
because when you start playing a game
and if you don't have an instruction
manual and you don't know how to play
the game it's not going to be fun so you
eventually pick it up you pick up on it
so give it two weeks give it a month and
then see if you become obsessed with it
because you probably will you'll you'll
see that first Spark of growth and
you'll be like oh this is possible
and then you'll just double down Double
Down double down and eventually three
years later you'll be at close to 500k
to a million followers across platforms
so truly grateful for all of you that
are here we recently passed 10K we
passed 10K on YouTube I'm so stoked
because YouTube is different YouTube is
I'm dragging on here but YouTube is very
special to me it's very special to me
it's something I've been putting in work
into for a long time uh compared to
other social media platforms that hasn't
grown
nearly as much because I want to I want
it to be one of those things where I can
provide like the most value and like
like aha moments and mindset shifts
imaginable so if I've done that for you
one thank you for being here I wouldn't
be able to do that if that relationship
wasn't there so that connection wasn't
there so I love you guys and to end the
