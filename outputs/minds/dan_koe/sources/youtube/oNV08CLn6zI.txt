this past month i have realized a common
theme in my life and the life of many
others that i
am connected with and that common theme
is obsession as a kid i was obsessed
with finding a better way of living
that's what i noticed that i've i've
always been
a silent observer and not like
observing people in a judgmental way but
in a discerning way and i would be lying
if it wasn't a bit judgmental at first
but thankfully i at least try to come to
my senses and not be a very judgmental
person i try not to but
you guys know how that is it's it's hard
to escape but
it would always blow my mind to
see how other people lived right you can
go to the grocery store and you can just
see like you can observe
silently and discern
whether their actions are good or bad
what are they putting into their grocery
cart uh how do they look do you want to
look that way you're trying to notice
the reflection in yourself here what
kind of reaction does that cause and
what can you learn from that reaction so
one thing that i was very big on
observing was the conventional
career path right you're told your
entire life to go to school
get a job
retire
and that the entire thing sparked a lot
of questions for me it's like why am i
going to do this stuff to
possibly
get a job in this market possibly
enjoy
the the 70 of my life that i have that i
don't have to myself right you only have
like 30 of your life to live on your own
terms when you're working
eight hours out of the day and then
also you are possibly
going to be set up for success
after 65 years so thinking back and
reflecting on this i think this was a
major
reason why i decided to
not pursue that path i went to school
i ended up dropping out after five years
because i switched majors too many times
i didn't know what i wanted to do right
i don't think anyone knows what they
want to do at 18. they don't it's
impossible to know what you want to do
at 18. i was also the naive young
teenager that was like oh i know what to
do oh i'm smarter than this 30 year old
it's like no you're not it's temporal
leverage it's time there i'm only 25 and
i have been enlightened
to this fact very quickly that your your
brain just isn't developed enough you
can notice it like once you turn
22 23 24 whatever
either way at 18 you're going to be that
kid that is like no i'm smarter than
everyone it's inescapable but i'm just
letting you know now that when you get
older you will realize some things and
i have
like i'm still in that space where it's
like no i'm smarter than this guy and at
40 years old i'm probably going to be
enlightened to many other things that
i'm not aware of right now so pursuing
an unconventional career path is
one something that hasn't been available
for a long time right i'm very fortunate
that i grew up in the time with the
internet boom and i'm very glad that it
is continuing to boom because that's
what that's who i went to to kind of
find solace and people that i could
connect with right i would follow the
youtubers the fitness youtubers and i
learned a lot from them it got me in the
gym for 10 years it uh opened my mind
and kind of expanded my awareness to
understand that like oh
there's an economy
and then there's a digital economy and
they both work similarly i need to learn
how to get in on this
and create something that i can monetize
and make money from and so that led to
me trying failing seven different
business models if you've watched my
channel before you understand this tried
everything right and then after like
five four or five years of just trying
all of these things and failing
everything clicked because that's that's
how it is you gain awareness from your
failures you find the things that would
have led to success earlier that you you
just didn't
know existed because you didn't dive
into it a bit it's like when you start
your first business it's almost
inevitably going to fail because there
are just some things that books can't
teach you there are things that you
are going to glance over because you
just have no idea what they mean right
when someone's telling you oh you need
to do this that and that
a lot of that will not make sense
because you haven't gotten to the place
where it will make sense to you now
after all this time this has led me to
what i am theorizing this is a theory as
the future career path where what i
think
a almost everyone will have to do
in order to make some form of an income
the human psyche is wired for
entrepreneurship it is wired for
survival that is in modern day
entrepreneurship is
survival modern day survival is
entrepreneurship we used to hunt
gather trade and now we hunt for let's
say ideas we
gather information we make connections
and then we trade value through the
internet right and so in my eyes
the
people and i experienced this at my nine
to five
is that
it's the difference between pursuing an
intrinsic hierarchy of goals and an
extrinsic hierarchy of goals and there
is a big difference that big difference
there in terms of how your neurobiology
is affected it's kind of it's not good
dopamine versus bad but it is pursuing
someone else's goals as opposed to
pursuing your own goals right in the
past there were no corporations or
corporate culture there were communities
but communities are comprised of
individuals right they are
individuals that have their own
intrinsic hierarchy of goals within the
community's intrinsic hierarchy of goals
they can do their own thing they can
hunt gather do whatever they want by
themselves i may be wrong there but
i'm speaking from experience here
when i say that building something that
you want to build
will you will notice the dopamine and
other neurochemicals flooding your brain
it feels good it's progress but when you
do that for someone else let's say like
you're a freelancer and you're doing
client work for someone else you're
doing what you enjoy doing which may be
like design but when you're doing it for
someone else that working on that
project does not have the same effect as
working on a project that you love it's
like
it's skill for someone else
compared to
art for you now how do we start this
it's it's curiosity we keep talking
about curiosity but i want to read
uh two quotes from neval's thread called
how to get rich without getting lucky
the first one is specific knowledge is
knowledge that you cannot be trained for
if society can train you it can train
someone else and replace you then the
next one is specific knowledge is found
by pursuing your genuine curiosity and
passion rather than whatever is hot
right now so what that means is that
figuring things out for yourself as
opposed to
doing what other people tell you to do
is how you gain specific knowledge right
there is and that is immensely valuable
this is kind of a subtle flex but
this past week
i gained 120 000 followers on instagram
i know exactly how i did that
other people don't know how it's not
buying followers it's not any of these
like weird hacks i understand it enough
i've been in the game long enough and
dissected the social media platform for
long enough to understand oh it finally
clicked this is exactly what i need to
do in order to grow and it worked and
that's specific knowledge you will never
find that in a course you will never
find that online you will never find
that really anywhere unless i tell you
how to do it but even then
there is so much involved there like my
branding my minimalist style and all
this other things where if i told you
what it was you're not going to get the
same results so you need to figure
things out on your own
if you want you need to stick stay in
the game long enough and figure things
out that and make discoveries that other
people have not
made right if you dive into an iceberg
of whatever you want to master
that is how you get this extremely
valuable specific knowledge so on the
topic of curiosity you have to
understand uh conditioning in general
because for the 13 the first 18 years of
your life before adulthood you
were kind of told what to be curious at
things were given to you there's a
common theme here
you may be able to notice but for the
first 18 years of your life it's like
you you have to imitate imitate people
in order to survive that's what you do
by your parents you're told here's what
you eat here is how you walk here is how
you use the bathroom and then you go to
school and it's like here's what you
learn
that's it here's what you learn do your
homework and then your friends they're
doing the same thing with their parents
and they start projecting their opinions
on you and you start forming these
beliefs that you eventually that those
eventually create your identity we're
going to talk about this more in the
next video but you're getting the point
here where
uh as a child before you were like
started learning things you were very
curious you'd go outside you'd find the
beauty and the flowers and you'd laugh
at everything sure you'd cry and you'd
poop your pants or whatever you
do but
that it wasn't because you were attached
to your identity it was because you're a
 baby so now that we're in
adulthood or you're at least being made
aware of this
things need to switch from cope to
curiosity from
oh
no there's no other way to doing this to
maybe i could do that
maybe it's questioning right it's like
oh that guy got lucky and it's like
instead
no stop
what skill did he learn in order to do
that
what is he actually doing here
uh what goes on behind the scenes what
is he posting about how did he learn
about that you just ask questions
horizontally and vertically until you
gain the bigger picture and then you can
make whatever opinion you want to but
aside from that it's just assumption
it's a blurred lens that you're looking
through and you're not seeing the full
picture you're just telling yourself
you're feeding yourself a story that you
want to hear based on your prior
conditioning so after questioning it's
let's let's take the example of a skill
like oh what if i did learn that skill
that would lead to me doing x y and z
that the next step after curiosity is
education you buy books on it you look
on youtube you google search it you find
the answers the answers are out there
especially for
beginner level stuff the specific
knowledge that you find by actually
doing these things that comes later but
the beginner level the principles of all
of this stuff let's say the skill if i i
could watch a youtube
you guys are lucky we're all
lucky
because if i want to learn graphic
design i can go and watch an hour long
video on youtube that will teach me
everything i need to know about graphic
design
and then once i do that and i make a few
of my own projects i can go and apply
for a graphic design job and if i'm
smart enough
and the job isn't silly enough to write
off talent that doesn't have a degree
which a lot of them are opening up that
option i could get a job
but for watching a few hours of youtube
videos or i could go in freelance and do
whatever i want so i have a theory
which we will dive into more in later
videos but i have a theory that
humans are documenting the collective
consciousness online the the internet
social media is a giant mind as is the
universe again we can dive into all of
my weird theories but
the humans make sense of things from
stories labels concepts
all of that fun stuff what do we post
online we post the things that we can
make sense of that's what our mind does
it makes sense of things we're telling
stories we are posting our opinions we
are posting advice we are posting
everything that our mind can make sense
of and that we think will make sense to
other people so it is becoming a giant
mind but
this means that creators personal brands
uh
thought leaders as cringe as that word
is because it's not well known and i
also have a theory that that is going to
be
one of the greatest uh
evolvers of humanity because ideas
beget ideas in order for us to have
these innovative ideas we need
more ideas like something can't be built
unless the idea was birthed first so we
need the thinkers that are expanding
their mind but what these creators and
personal brands and thought leaders and
online educators they're doing is
they're condensing information
i want you to think about this because
humans can process around
126 bits of information per second the
things that we are conscious of now what
used to take let's say four years in an
outdated formal college curriculum let's
say those four that four years of
information was uh 60 million bits of
information that we had to process right
now from that and from education and all
this other stuff
humans and these creators have gotten
results
simplified it into a process that helps
people get results faster they've
condensed the information they're
putting it in courses they're putting it
online as content and what used to take
that 60 million bits of information to
get results now takes maybe 10 million
bits of information and this process
goes on that's a that's what creation is
right you are creating better solutions
for people and that way we are able to
expand our mind and
develop ourselves intellectually a lot
faster way faster than we used to be so
now's the time where i kind of
transition into the practicality of all
of this where
yeah pursuing your curiosity sounds
great but like how how what do you do
with that how do you
like actually do that full time
potentially full time or
something else like that so you need to
understand two things you need to
understand media and code so media is
the message media is
communication it's how we communicate as
people especially online right like
we're
like tvs used to have commercials that's
media but now and the shows themselves
were media but now it's online
everything is media litera the front end
the entirety of what we see on the
internet is media
right you don't see the back end which
is the code which we'll get into but
media is how we distribute the valuable
condensed information
like the zip file like knowledge the 10
million bits of information that you
expand in your mind and it or like i
guess plug into your mind and it gives
you what used to be that 60 million bits
of information
that's what media is it's information so
in order to display your value online
because we already have the first two
steps right it's curiosity and then it's
self-education so learning
by yourself online right and then what
do you do you are a perspective vessel
nothing is original but there are
original perspectives and that's where
you come in so the best way to do this
in my opinion is like you don't need
experience to post a video online you
don't need experience to post an article
online you don't need experience for any
of this stuff especially if you
understand perspective and positioning
which is a marketing term so along with
all this curiosity if you want to make
it work and impactful and effective you
need to understand marketing
psychology persuasion possibly
epistemology philosophy you need to
understand the mind you need to
understand how we make sense of things
so stories metaphors concepts what
catches attention what holds attention
what is deemed valuable that's what you
need to do but you can learn it in
public you can post your perspective on
something that you are learning and you
can give credit to people it's like
there are ways around not having
experience and building experience
while
using this opportunity to post videos
articles tweets posts whatever it may be
as a way to learn more you learn the
most let's say you're studying design
you will learn the most when you
actually create something
and then you have somewhere to post it
you have accountability you have direct
feedback so rather than sitting in your
room and making fancy little designs or
even just learning and not doing
anything with it post it online it's not
like you have to turn this into a
business because
even then twitter linkedin instagram
they're all public resumes you don't
even have to grow you just have to post
your stuff and then let's say you apply
for a design job it's like oh let me see
your work oh here's my instagram they
look at it they're like oh this is
 beautiful you're hired right
that's optimal situation but you get the
point so just by doing this at a minimum
you are not only learning faster but you
are potentially
getting a job so you can make more money
and then if you want to take the
entrepreneurship route you have a good
paying job that you can help fuel that
with not that it costs anything to begin
with but
then at a maximum you're building
leverage for the future let's say you're
just doing this to get a job right let's
say you build 10 000 followers based on
design and then you go and create your
own design course because at this point
you have specific knowledge you've done
things on your own enough to know okay
these are the roadblocks i want people
to avoid this is what this is how i
would learn it and all of this other
stuff you package it up and you can give
it away for free if you have a bad
relationship with like selling courses
and other things or you
package it up into a course or
consulting or online mentoring imagine
this right
i've been toying with this for a bit but
why why isn't online mentoring a bigger
thing right
because at school it's like oh yeah you
need mentoring and so you go after
school and uh someone helps you for an
hour and
you get like one-on-one help but what
about
like online
right what if you know design really
well and people that are following you
want to learn how to design things so
they can increase their own value and so
they hire you for mentoring and you get
on a zoom call with them and you walk
them through here's how you design stuff
here's the design fundamentals all this
other things and boom you make an income
and you may have freelance work coming
to you and all this other stuff and this
is oh man one thing i have to mention i
keep forgetting to mention this like in
blogs and on podcasts so this is
exclusive for you guys because one
limiting belief that i had and so many
other people have
is
there
they don't have the creator mindset
and they
they think that there is
like too many creators when it's only
like less than one percent of people are
creators but even then think about this
how many
interests do you have how many people do
you follow on social media maybe like
two to five hundred people right maybe
more
everyone follows that many people
right did you ever make that connection
like even creators i follow maybe like
three 500 people and it's because i'm
interested in those things it's not like
it's not like someone is going to choose
you over someone else because of like oh
they can't follow enough people
everyone in the world is going to follow
five to 700 people right there is more
than enough work that's what the creator
economy is it's a self-sufficient utopia
you don't have to sell these digital
products only either
you can sell more than that if you want
to open up a farm and
uh be like your followers go to grocery
store then you can do that you can sell
anything that's already selling if you
want to learn how to create
refrigerators and sell
refrigerators to someone be my guest so
we understand media the front end of the
internet that's how you communicate so
you capture attention that's how you
potentially sell something of value to
someone else and make an income for
yourself now there's code which is the
back end of the internet and what houses
all this stuff and uh is what
like the advancements of tech and code
allow
for more creativity we are kind of
replacing some jobs here and there but
we're creating new jobs creators or
uh whatever this is or even sometimes
freelancing it wasn't a thing before
like we're creating an entirely new
digital economy that's why i started
digital economics my own school for this
stuff is because there's
a fit there i want to train people to be
able to fuel this economy so the thing
about code is it's very similar
in the fact that you can self-educate
online
you can learn how to code you can
increase your value very very quickly
and you can get a
job
you can get a job without a degree
in six to 12 months that's what i did i
got a job in a year by learning to code
i used my income from that job to fuel
my side business and now it is it has
been my full-time business for three
years now the brutal combo with this
is that the coders
have
kind of
made their own jobs in a sense where
it's not only about web design now it's
not only about building fancy websites
it's not even about building sas or
software as a service it's not they've
created no code tools for these things
so there's drag and drop website
builders right but my point here is is
that you anyone can take what they're
curious about
build their own website build their own
email list sign up for a free social
media account it's all free and then you
start attracting an audience by learning
psychology
all of this other stuff how like how to
catch attention and you
dissect the social media platform
so you understand how do i get eyeballs
on my profile because that's how you
gain followers right that that's it
that's what a lot of people start up
it's not just posting content you have
to get eyes on your profile and in order
to get followers so now
i want to read this quote to you from
jack butcher who's a designer so it's
kind of fitting but he said build
distribution then build whatever you
want
so as we've learned uh this is important
distribution is just potential traffic
it's it's an audience it's an email list
it's communities it's your network's
audience it's
everyone that can send traffic to
something right so let's say i build
a 100 000 follower audience let's say i
want to sell a physical planner which i
actually used to i want to sell a
journal
easier
i want to sell a journal and i have my
friends on the internet let's say i have
like five friends i connected with them
in the dms they have a hundred thousand
followers too so now that's six hundred
thousand followers five six hundred
something
and
now i reach out to them i write a post
promoting my new product i have them
send traffic to it and i get that many
eyes on my product
if i make a lot of sales like that's a
lot of money so that's the point build
distribution and then build whatever you
want because
at some point when you have enough
traffic you really can build whatever
you want especially like you see mr not
mr bc's not a very good example but you
see people online where it's like they
have their merch they have other things
that are exclusive to them and they have
distribution and so they're going to
sell it to them now with all of this the
world is going personal we're losing
trust in formal education we're losing
we're losing trust
in corporations we want that human
connection more and the thing with that
is is that as i've illustrated in this
video
everything's kind of going decentralized
right youtube
can is educating people on modern skills
much faster than colleges are people are
flocking there and learning and making
as much money as they want because
that's just how that's what happens
right and
it's going to continue to move more
individual as it would it used to be
individual like individuals within
communities and then corporations were
like oh no i'm going to come and take
this all for myself and now it's going
back to individuals and communities so
keep an eye out for that because a lot
of people are talking about this
and
it's
inevitable i mean i'm a part of it many
other people are a part of it and with
that i i also want to read this quote
from naval naval was a huge inspiration
for this video and everything else that
went along with it
there are almost 7 billion people on
this planet someday i hope there will be
seven billion companies
of all and the thing with this is is
like i didn't understand it at first
it's like seven billion companies like
no way
no not everyone can have a business and
then maybe a year or two after being
exposed to this quote
it's like yeah this is actually
can happen and probably will happen
sometime soon
so
might as well just try to take advantage
now so let's make this
even more practical right i'm a fan of
practicality i'm also a fan of theory as
you can tell at the beginning of my
videos so people that stay later in my
videos they get a bit
of like a treat now but this may be
beginner level advice this is beginner
level advice but for the people that
just like want to learn more about this
i'll give
some to you so
when it comes to products and services
there's three different types you can
sell right there's done for you
done with you and do it yourself done
for you is like freelancing where you
literally create let's say a website for
someone right and then there's done with
you which is like consulting or the
online mentoring thing i was talking
about where you get on a call with
someone or you're in the dms with
someone and you help them with whatever
problem
you can solve because of your expertise
and then there's do it yourself which is
something like a course where you
package up that information that you
have and you sell it and distribute it
to other people so another
naval quote what do you know the first
one is a quote from archimedes but it
leads into the next one very well so
that quote is
give me a lever long enough
and a place to stand and i will move the
earth and then after that follows from
naval
fortunes will require leverage business
leverage comes from capital people and
products with no marginal cost of
replication code and media
so this
is like i've been dissecting naval's
philosophy on this and i've kind of it's
become my own philosophy without even
realizing that it was from naval but
this is how you make a fortune for
yourself and we're talking about like
wealth here not just riches right we're
talking about having more than enough
money to
meet your basic needs and do what you
want
it's what humans are meant to do so with
all of that
start building
leverage
start posting online you don't have to
be in the entrepreneurial mindset yet
eventually you will be because it's part
of your psyche but
start posting
why not you learn faster you possibly
get job opportunities it's personal
growth it really is it sheds light on
your blind spots very quickly and it
helps you it gives you a project to
apply everything to right you may you
might not be remembering or experiencing
certain things because it's like i don't
have a place to actually
utilize this thought or idea that's the
difference between a thought and idea is
utility
right so you're out and about you're
having this thought
and then it's like oh i could write
about this online
and so you start to organize it and
you're like how can this actually help
people and so it's it's great because
you start turning everyday experiences
into life lessons that not only you
benefit from because they get solidified
in your mind that way but you're helping
other people and you're attracting an
audience and you're actually doing some
good in the world and you're impacting
people
where it truly matters and that is their
direct human experience
so
that is it for this video i have more
coming to you

about intelligent imitation but for now
