how to do whatever the you want
step one is to know yourself this
practice takes a lot of time your entire
lifetime most people that try to do what
they want are actually doing what others
want for them they were conditioned to
have the same dreams goals and Ambitions
as their parents and their parents were
influenced by Society culture their
parents and almost everything else that
Evolution has led to in this modern
society start questioning who you are
and let time deliver answers next is to
reflect on what you don't want you have
to dig into your past experiences to get
hints at your ideal future and this
doesn't happen overnight self-reflection
a constant practice of self-reflection
is a self-corrective process it is like
your compass going into the future that
is how you gain Clarity on your future
you can't just imagine what you want
without knowing what you don't want or
even in that case what you want like
when you went on a vacation one time and
you were like oh my gosh I would love to
live in this location specifically in
the future you can reflect back on that
experience and you can reap those same
feelings right you can imagine how the
air felt or the sun on your skin or the
palm trees or just the design of the the
interior that of the hotel you were
staying in the certain things that you
like the certain things that you don't
like over time help you construct a
vision for your future that you can work
towards and this doesn't have to be
perfect at the start if you know you
want to live in some remote tropical
location then you can start working
towards that and creating a life that
allows you to do that and spot problems
that are standing in the way if you
can't because you have a job then you
need to start a business if you don't
have time to start a business then you
need to get a better job and so on and
so forth it's going to take a lot of
 time and the thing with this is
about what we talked about is that that
there is no absolute way to know that
the future is certain like there is no
way to know with absolute certainty what
you want in the future and this is why
the masses flock to secure jobs belief
systems and other things like that it's
an illusion of certainty to avoid
struggle it's a trap you can't skip
making mistakes because as we talked
about mistakes are your light in the
dark on this journey life this entire
thing all of your success boils down to
endlessly solving the right problems the
next step to doing whatever the you
want is to do whatever the you want
but with intention intention means that
you are stretching towards a goal it
means that this is not mindlessly doing
whatever the you want because the
question here is like you don't want to
do whatever you want what if someone
wants to go and murder someone or jump
off a cliff that's not what they want to
do there's mental illness and there's
other things like that which I'm not
going to touch on in this video I don't
know anything about it what I'm saying
for the average individual they I'm
assuming that they do not want to run
and jump off of The Cliff I'm assuming
that most people want to act towards a
better future for themselves and be able
to live that better future so they can
really do whatever they want once they
know what they want and if you look at
the lives of successful people and since
they're on social media you get direct
access to this and especially the honest
ones where I can attest to this but most
people will tell you that they wouldn't
want to be doing anything else David
Goggins as an extreme example puts
himself through a lot of pain and
suffering every single day because it's
rewarding because it's something that he
wants to do he doesn't want to feel like
a lazy sack of after shoveling an
entire cake down his throat nobody wants
that your illusion of that quick hit of
pleasure is not a want that's a just a
manifest actual desire that you can't
control in your head and that's really
the entire process that you need to
repeat throughout your entire life you
can't just walk unconsciously mindlessly
doing what other people want you to do
for the rest of your life you have to
make the conscious decision to start
making conscious decisions and be
conscious and aware of every single
action that you plan on taking and where
it is going to lead you have to act with
intention you need to set some form of
goal for your future reflect on the past
to understand and gain Clarity on how to
actually reach that self-educate learn
study via the Internet in order to
bridge those Clarity gaps even more
start executing give yourself a bigger
time Horizon not two weeks but one
percent of 50 years is six months and so
six months
that's that's such a tiny amount of time
and people can't even make it that far
because they want the the quick results
they don't see the Gap when you're
watching someone on social media and you
see a mansion or you see a car or these
other things that you think you want but
you don't really want you want the thing
that lies under that that those things
are hinting at but you can't see beyond
the surface and actually dig deep into
what you actually want and we see those
things and since they're just so readily
available to see without putting any
work and it feels good it's like it's a
weird feeling when you get the cheap
dopamine from looking at those things
but it keeps you in this surface level
living where you you don't even think
like most people will say oh like lucky
for him he has the mansion He has the
fancy car he has the hot wife and it's
like if you actually think about it it
probably took him and it did take him it
took everyone their entire lives to get
to that point there are of course
special cases here but that's just
another quick fix mindset right
you're you make the so you see the thing
you get the cheap dopamine hit and then
you get the next cheap dopamine hit from
thinking oh they're just Rich they're
just lucky they were born with this
money this Mansion all of the above and
it's just another form of dopamine that
keeps you enslaved in this little
Mindless bubble of not doing what you
want so that's just the thing if you
aren't seeing results in your life it's
because you're distracted you don't know
what you want out of life because you
haven't tried anything you haven't tried
anything because you make excuses for
the results that other people have and
how they actually got those things and
because you haven't tried anything that
means you haven't committed anything so
you haven't stuck it out long enough to
actually have enough skill to get
results with that thing and then lastly
you don't know what's possible because
you haven't moved forward in life by
trying something committing to it for
even just three months and acquiring
some form of skill in that domain
because what you want right now may be
completely different tomorrow in a week
in a month in a year in a decade so you
have to consistently self-correct along
this path and tell you by the it really
depends on how soon you start this
journey but let's say you start this
journey at 16 you realize okay I am
definitely able to do more with my life
and so I'm going to start now and even
if you fall off here and there you're
going to get to your ideal life much
much quicker than someone starts at like
30. and with all of this this is
supposed to be difficult life is
difficult there is struggle in Conflict
baked into the system you can see this
at every single level or perspective
going up and up the ladder of everything
it's not only the struggle and conflict
in your little brain that reflects on
the cosmic scale as well stars explode
all the time there's Wars going on right
now struggle is a universal thing it is
very unwise to think that it is not
supposed to be a part of your life and
once you realize that it is supposed to
be a part of your life and that it is
the secret for unlocking the profound
lessons that birth after the battle is
resolved the creative emergence after
that that is also reflected on all
scales of life that is when things start
to get good so learn to fall in love
with the struggle or the challenge by
leaning into it and it does get a lot a
lot easier with time but that is it for
this short video I hope you enjoyed it I
hope it brought some insight I'm
enjoying doing these short ones because
it keeps it a bit uh more bite-sized
than it reminds not only me but
hopefully you to stay on this path that
we are on I feel like that's what good
content does it it encourages you it
doesn't give you all of the steps it
encourages you to create them for
yourself and think for yourself and I am
but a gentle reminder along the path so
I appreciate you watching if you enjoyed
