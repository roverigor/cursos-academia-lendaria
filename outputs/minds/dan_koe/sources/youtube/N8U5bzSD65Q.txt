ever since i can remember i
have always wanted to do what i love for
a living and
that's what everyone wants right
everyone wants that but everyone is
screaming at them to do the complete
opposite of what they want right so go
to school do whatever you know you know
what you're told to do when
you were a kid and what your parents
thought was possible what you thought
was possible at the time you already had
some preset future for yourself and so
that's kind of what i did i started out
on that path i went to college and i
partied the entire time i learned
creative skills on the side i studied
all of my interests i was deep into
fitness and nutrition and going to the
gym with my buddies during high school
and i also started online businesses
like as much as i possibly could i just
tried everything and then when i got to
college i
uh started to learn to code because i
heard that it was lucrative i got sucked
down that entire rabbit hole i
was listening to coding podcasts i was
deep in that coding community and i
loved every second of it and so that's
what i did on the side i built out
coding projects and as my online
businesses continued to fail i
decided that it was time for me to call
it quits because one i had been in
college for too long so i dropped out i
didn't see that going anywhere for me
even though i was like a straight a
student in high school and i ended up
getting a
front-end web developer job at in
at a web design agency and that paid 50
55k a year so throughout this entire
time i had been i always had a
meaningful side project that i wanted to
work on from the ages of like 16 to 25 i
was always working on something on the
side whether it be a coding project or a
business or learning a skill or just
building something out i did digital art
for a long time i just always had
something to fill my time and something
that i could apply my learnings too and
the reason i did this is because it made
me happy right and after studying flow
and psychology for a bit of time i
understand why that is now that's
because i had a vision i had a goal and
i was able to focus
uh
my consciousness if you will or i was
able to absorb myself be absorbed by the
skill that i was learning the goal that
i was pursuing and it was intrinsically
motivating because that skill had
meaning to me or that project had
meaning to me it wasn't someone else
telling me what project or what skill to
learn it was by my choice by my design
me creating and living in my own reality
is what caused me to continue to be
obsessed with and somewhat addicted to
those projects because
that's how it goes you want to be in
flow for a lot of your life that is
arguably the key to life is pursuing
your own goals and educating yourself to
the point of consistently progressing in
those goals and this is why i believe so
many people are unhappy because you
could just pull up a random statistic
online about how many people set and
actually stick to
their own individual goals not what you
have been conditioned to want to create
for yourself so right now my current
projects are my new writing product
which you can find in the description
and that's kind of what this video is
about but it's also getting back in into
the gym i've been in the gym the entire
time but it hasn't been as fulfilling
and so me understanding this and
becoming aware of this has made me set a
new goal based on performance rather
than uh vanity now looks are important
but i want to go in and i want to
progress on my lifts simply because it's
just something i want to do there's
that's it and it makes me happy to do
that and i'm actually pumped right it's
kind of ritualistic to uh get into the
flow get in the car go to the gym and
then just lift a bunch of heavy so
why am i telling you all this is because
there is one extremely important skill
and that is figuring it out for yourself
not doing what people tell you to do and
doing what you want from a conscious
mind not like a mediocre mind where it's
like oh i can do whatever i want you
want me to jump off a bridge okay i'll
go do that and it's like that's not what
you want you don't want to jump off a
bridge what do you want what are your
desires and what is the
either survival mechanism or whatever is
pulling you towards those things
about is it good or bad do you actually
want to do it does it align with your
values do you actually have values and
now what people are telling you to do is
not
going to be conducive to what you want
and a lot of the time you may have to do
it for your survival but at the same
time you need to be pursuing a project
on your own that will lead to
you being you having autonomy and you
being able to pursue mastery in the
thing that you want to
master
full time right not for someone else and
so another reason for me telling you
this is because
a lot of what i wanted to do with my
life was deemed impossible
because the closed mind of many would
like to
they project their opinions and they
want to say the things or they do say
the things that
may discourage you or may pull you down
or may lead you down another path and
that is not what you want for yourself
and that is not what i want for you so
this entire thing means that in order to
pursue
mastery and autonomy to be able to do
what you love full-time you need to
learn a skill that will allow you to
monetize those things to monetize your
interests and your passions and so in
this i'm going to present an argument as
to why writing is that skill that will
help you thrive no matter
like no matter whether there's a
recession whether whatever we'll we'll
dive into it so
why writing first the back end of the
internet is code the internet runs on
code the front end what you see is media
right and so if you want to tap into the
infinite leverage and possibilities of
the internet and being able to connect
with anyone then you need to learn one
or the other right those are two very
extremely broad pathways that you can go
down code or media but you have to
understand that
code
has gotten to the point where there are
no code tools anyone can build a website
anyone can get on social media and
really reach anyone in the world if they
are smart enough and know how to network
so i'm not going to talk about code here
even though i was a web developer but
media
right you have the
you can use code or no code tools in
order to distribute your media
fast and to as many people as possible
and that is what captures attention you
need attention and you need people in
order to get eyes on your products or
services if you want to make money
outside of a job you need to create a
product or a service so whether that be
a course a physical product like a bag
of coffee if you want to start a coffee
brand or a service business so
freelancing we're talking about writing
here so you could freelance with writing
you can freelance with other media based
marketing based skills and what blows my
mind is that some people don't see the
power in this right
what used to take
a
team of web developers to build out a
membership platform for let's say a
course or even just a community that you
build it would take an entire thing and
now there's a website that you can log
on and build one in less than maybe 10
to 60 minutes right and do not ask me in
the comments which one to get go
research you have google start using all
of this stuff and the thing is is like
how does this not fuel you with like the
most insane energy of like i can do
whatever i want now that i have these
tools
in the modern world that are
on the internet that i can just like
literally tap into but instead there's
two types of people right there's the
people that use the internet for
distracting themselves and then there's
people that use the internet to build
leverage and make an income and spread a
positive message and do what they enjoy
yes it takes time but
that's the main thing that is the main
differentiator
between
abundance and mediocrity right it's
literally a flip of a switch of how you
use the thing that's in your hand so i
talked about how i learned to code but
that's not one of my main reasons for
learning to code i wanted to freelance
with that skill and that meant that i
that it was more so marketing than it
was code so i was building websites with
website builders as opposed to just
coding when i did get into freelance
right everyone tells you oh you need to
learn uh this marketable skill you need
to learn e-commerce you need to learn
seo you need to learn
all of this other and that's what i
did but there was a problem there was a
reason that i wasn't making any money
from these is because i was so obsessed
with building the actual business
building the website making it look good
using my design skills whatever it may
be but then when it came to acquiring
customers that is when
everything failed and that's when i
didn't really do anything right you
don't have a business if you don't have
customers so that
once i learned about writing which is
what we're talking about and marketing
and sales and how they all intertwine
then
things started to pick up because i
understood i need to get my message in
front of people and present an argument
for my services and promote myself and
display my value online if i want access
to these opportunities
so again
why
writing and now you have to understand
that media what people see on the
internet and what catches attention the
foundation of media is writing tweets or
writing threads are writing newsletters
blogs are writing youtube videos
are
from a written script or at least they
do the best from a written script
because you can organize the message
advertisements online usually writing
based tick tocks reels short form video
also it's like me reading a tweet from
my phone right that's what i do is
because the message is more impactful
and i will outperform
any dude with six pack abs and a poor
message with my high impact writing
in various mediums whether that be
something like a youtube video or
even uh
what is it like a real or a tick tock
but even then i can just screenshot my
tweet put it on instagram call myself a
writer because that's what i am and
outperform and grow to 230 000 followers
without posting
uh like a picture of my six pack or
something like that even though i could
probably
beat out some people but i just like
writing it's more private right it's
more private and i can dedicate myself
to
a craft and
delivering a valuable message as opposed
to
just joining in on the the sausage fest
online so since this is a bit different
from my other videos because this one is
more actionable right some of my other
ones are more abstract which i enjoy
doing but i
want to deliver
some more value over the coming weeks
months
so
towards the end of my videos after i
give context like that i'm going to go
over step by step either process advice
or just a framework you can use to
actually implement the things that i'm
saying into your life and test them and
practice for yourself so these are my
nine steps for starting a one person
writing business and just to i guess
give social proof or
authority because it's important to show
that i know what i'm doing i'm not a
writer i don't have an english degree i
don't you don't need an english degree i
don't think the world wants english
degrees writing online they want good
authentic and impactful writers which
means high energy aka talking about the
things you want to talk about
and
delivering it in your own unique voice
like you would be texting a friend
that's what social media is this is
digital writing as opposed to
professional writing or academic writing
so
i'm throwing a lot of the rules out the
window with my writing just because i
like to write how i speak and i like to
write
whether it follows the perfect
little writing rules or not
i like to write how i want to write and
how i think it will deliver the most
impact and the most value so i'm just
saying here that i average around forty
to sixty thousand dollars per month from
my writing in about two hours a day of
that writing now of course i am also
building projects on the side so i do
work longer than that but overall if i
were to strip away everything except for
twitter my newsletter and uh twitter
threads i would retain 80 to 90 of my
income simply because i don't really
promote on other platforms and
all of my other platforms like youtube
or
instagram they're all just based off of
what i've already written right as a
writer so let's get into the steps right
so step one is to choose
a topic that you cannot shut up about
right and so how do you find these
topics well one
what are your favorite books what do you
enjoy reading what do you get sucked
into the other thing is what is your
youtube watch history right what are you
genuinely interested in that you love
learning about and love teaching about
right to your friends let's say you
learn something and then your friend
asks oh what are what's going on in your
life and you're like oh well i'm
learning about uh i'm learning how to
code
and i started building this website and
it's really cool like have you ever
heard about html css and the thing that
sucks is that your friends don't really
give a about that but there's an
audience online that does and they want
to hear you talk about it no matter your
experience because that's all
perspective based it's like oh well i
can't get online
and say that i'm making forty to sixty
thousand dollars a month writing so what
can i do well you can talk about it from
a different perspective right you can
post something as simple as seven things
that i learned
about impactful writing right and then
that is angled from a position that not
only helps you build authority but you
don't have to fake it and like be try to
be this guy that makes a ton of
money you just be the guy that is
learning
brand is what you do so whatever you're
doing right now that's how you write
right so if you're learning about
something then you are writing about how
you are learning this specific thing and
you're teaching what you are learning so
there's a few other ways that was like
youtube watch history and your favorite
books but your social your favorite
social media accounts that aren't meme
accounts or aren't they're value
creators they create value and they give
good advice so step number two is to
brainstorm a unique perspective why
because novelty catches attention people
like new things that's why when you go
out in nature and you're like oh wow
this is so beautiful it's novelty
or when you read a book and you read
someone's unique perspective that
completely makes sense to you and
changes the way you think about it
that's one dopamine in your brain that's
excitement but it's caused by a novel
perspective so how do you come up with a
novel perspective i want you to brain
dump or write down based on the topic
that we wrote down earlier common
problems associated with that topic
benefits from overcoming those problems
and
goals common goals associated with that
what are you helping people achieve
right that's where how-to advice comes
in where it's like what goal are you
helping them achieve and what problems
are standing in the way
your personal experiences related to
that and now after that what you do
is
you write it as if you were explaining
how to get to that goal to a friend
knowing what you do with all of that
context where it's like okay well i'm
trying to get to this goal but the
problem standing in the way is this so
how am i going to tell someone how to
get there because a problem creates the
perspective right everyone has different
problems but that's what creates the
perspective is
pretty much what reality or what angle
are you looking at this goal from and
achieving this goal from that's a unique
perspective so step number three is to
write 1000 plus words on the topic so
every single piece of online content or
at least good content is based around a
personal or professional problem so
here's how you'll structure your writing
that you can use this a thousand words
for let's say a newsletter or a blog
article or even like an instagram
caption or something like that where you
have a thousand words it starts with a
problem so you explain the problem it's
called a lead which comes after a
headline so you explain the problem and
you paint a picture of the problem and
how it's impacting people's lives
and then next what you can do is you can
either go into straight step-by-step
advice on how to overcome that or you
can give some context relating to the
benefits and why it is important to
overcome that problem to persuade people
further to actually take action so would
go explain the problem
give context and the why behind why they
should solve that problem and talk about
the benefits of overcoming it so that's
paragraph two and then paragraph three
or section three is step-by-step advice
on how to
uh do that it's the same thing as this
youtube video alright so step four is
setting up a blog or a newsletter
software so
this is mainly for building authority
right long form content builds authority
more than like a short form tweet or
reel or tick tock those are difficult to
make sales on and what people use those
for is to drive people to their email
list and sell once they've built
authority with the depth that they
provide in their content and holding
attention for longer right so i rarely
use fancy sales funnels or any of that
 anymore i use what i call the two
hour content ecosystem so what that is
is i write a newsletter every week i
condense that into a thread i condense
the actionable part into a thread which
is actually step five of this but i
condense that into a twitter thread and
i base my tweets off of that post for
the week and then i plug my backlog
newsletter
on the blog to
under my tweets so people can read it
and not only subscribe to the newsletter
there but purchase my products and
services that i plug inside of the
newsletter so you rarely see me promote
on the timeline
unless i am promoting like a new product
like i am in this video with the
two-hour writer so step number five is
to repurpose the actionable step-by-step
section into a twitter thread that can
be turned into an instagram carousel
or something else along those lines but
that is usually how you grow on social
media to start
is through actionable step-by-step
content to prove your authority and
people just love lists and
it gets your brain juices flowing when
you write a list a day so you can do a
list tweet where it's like how to do
this
step step step step step and then
summarize it in one line boom you're
you're a tweet writer now so
step number six is learning how to
actually grow on a platform right
because
too many people think or think they're
too good to actually learn strategies
for
social media growth when it's
it's literally the differentiator
between like whether you do what you
love for a living or not and so set your
ego aside because it's not just posting
good content if you aren't growing one
your content probably sucks like good
content yes is
a given but if it's like i
you have all of these expectations where
it's like oh man i'm this crazy
philosopher and i like to write things
so clever but nobody likes it it's a
problem with them and it's like no dude
you have no idea what people want and
you have no idea what an impactful
message consists of so the main thing is
that you have to understand one branding
so what makes a good profile what makes
a compelling profile and what makes
people want to follow you all of this is
human nature and human behavior it's
psychology it's marketing and
then
what you also need to learn is how to
get eyes on your profile because you can
have the best profile and best content
out there but if you don't know how to
get eyeballs on your profile then you're
not going to grow so how do you get eyes
on your profile one and the most
effective way is people sharing your
content with their audience right so
this is a retweet this is a story share
this is a facebook share this is a
youtube share
this is a like people sharing your
newsletter i don't know but then the so
there's multiple ways to do this one is
networking with other accounts that are
similar to you if you've taken a basic
social media growth course you
understand the importance of networking
and you understand that engagement
groups are a thing now i'm not a huge
fan of engagement groups but i am a fan
of making friends
networking with them and actually having
someone that you can grow with online
sharing strategies sharing each other's
posts it's a group of like three to five
people that are like your close online
friends because your offline friends
probably aren't doing this so you need a
new friend group to help grow with you
so another common way of doing this is
commenting on other big accounts posts
because they have a large audience so if
you post a good comment that delivers
value and catches attention this is
where you can practice your writing
skills then people will click on your
profile and if your profile is good
they'll follow you so another way is to
make your newsletter so good that it
just gains traction eventually and
people start talking about it and
sharing it with their friends and it's
the same with the youtube video where
you see a long youtube video and someone
shares it and
they're like damn this is so good and
you start building loyal followers from
the start and then a a less taboo way
than you think of growing
is by paying for shares and i'm not
talking i'm not talking paid
advertisements like facebook ads or
instagram booths or twitter boosts or
other things like that it's no you're
paying it's called influencer marketing
it's extremely important to learn in
modern times and it's really you pay
someone else to share your content right
they share it you get your content in
front of someone's audience if they like
your content then they follow you and
you're good to go i don't like shout
outs i like just pay someone for shares
so number seven is to turn
the impactful ideas from your long form
content so your newsletters into tweets
so my favorite way of writing shorter
form like punchy content is
uh the ppp framework that i came up with
and that i talk about in my new course
which is poll perspective punchline so
first you pull them in with something
that catches attention now this can be
so many different things and i would
recommend you study like headlines or
just how people capture attention or how
people lead into the body of their post
right where you can use a statistic you
can use a shocking fact you can use
things like the word you or you can
exaggerate a bit where it's like the
greatest skill of the 21st century
is writing right because people start
reading it's like the most the greatest
skill okay i'm going to continue writing
reading because i want to figure out
what that is so you have to understand
what catches attention what leads people
into the valuable parts of your post so
then the unique perspective or just a
different way of framing it
is good and then after that is a punch
line so something that ties it all
together so i'll give one example here
this is a recent tweet of mine and it
says people will spend 10 hours worrying
about a task that takes 10 minutes to
complete so not only there am i starting
with people which people relate with
right it's like people on people i'm
going to read this people will spend 10
hours and then 10 and 10 are also
numbers those catch attention uh
with themselves and this is also unique
perspective on like worrying about
stupid things right so it's spending 10
hours worrying about a task that takes
10 minutes to complete and that's the
punch line in itself as well so one
sentence can have this in entirety but
let's go over a different one right so
most people will spend eight hours on
someone else's dreams four hours hiding
from their own two hours going through
the motions 16 hours awake 24 hours of
sleep it doesn't have to take 40 years
in a retirement plan to realize that a
participation trophy isn't
fulfilling so you can see this ppp
framework spread out a bit more in like
longer list style tweets because i have
the first line most people will spend
which catches attention because it's
most people
and then
a unique perspective on like what people
do and i use numbers to hold attention
as well and then i wrap it up at the end
with it doesn't have to take 40 years in
a retirement plan
to realize
that a participation trophy isn't
fulfilling and so this is just one of
many ways to start writing shorter form
content the best you can do is really to
start reading short form content or as
with learning anything you have to
imitate and then innovate where you
imitate someone's tweet right and use it
as like a soft structure for your own
and of course do not copy it
shouldn't have to say that but do not
copy
or plagiarize people's stuff you just
use it as inspiration and take the
structure of the tweet and make your own
and then once you get used to it and
practice and realize like okay this this
is working this isn't working
then you can start to
play around with it and see what works
best for you so number eight is
developing a system a writing system so
you can use other people's writing
systems all the time and i actually take
pride in this because in the two-hour
writer i help you create your own system
but the thing with this is that if you
use someone else's system or framework
that's great right and this is what i
want you to do though because um
things like systems and absolute advice
and like all of that stuff it strips you
of your ability to figure things out for
yourself self-experiment and come to
your own conclusions which is what makes
a real expert so my best advice is to
research different frameworks and
systems for writing or anything this is
a universal principle where
you research what you want to do you
find the different perspectives you
create your own you literally write down
steps of like okay i'm going to do this
with my writing whether it be like the
problem the context and the step-by-step
advice or like just when you write at
your desk am i going to try writing in
30 minute blocks or hour blocks or am i
going to write in the morning or at
night and you test and you experiment
and you see what works best for yourself
and then you can eventually package up
this system and tell people why it works
for you and then number nine the last
thing is branch out to other platforms
so once you have validated ideas from
let's say twitter then you can take
those validated ideas that have done
well in terms of engagement and have
helped you grow
and take those two other platforms and
just talk start talking about them again
because you already know they're going
to lead to growth right i grew on
instagram 10 times faster than anyone
else because i already had validated
ideas that i knew would do well as
content on instagram or linkedin or
youtube or even tick tock in some cases
or anything so let's recap on all of
this and what you can do with one to two
hours of writing a day and considering
that you have a product or service that
you can sell or you have an idea for one
that you can build and fuel with your
audience but eventually if you want and
you believe in yourself and you have an
abundance mindset and you understand
that the internet is infinite then you
can make a higher monthly salary than uh
like one of the world's most highest
paid doctors because they have a cap
there is no room for improvement for a
lot of them so here is a recap first
choose a topic that you cannot shut up
about two brainstorm a unique
perspective that you have three write
one thousand plus words in a structured
way for sign up for a blog or newsletter
platform and post it five turn the
actionable part of that newsletter
itself into a twitter thread five is
learn how to network and grow on the
platform six is turn your ideas from the
newsletter into individual tweets so you
have like a perpetual cycle of content
next is develop a system for your
writing and then the last one is to
branch out to other platforms when you
are ready and when you have validated
ideas so with all of that my new course
the two hour writer is going out soon it
is on pre-sale right now depending on
when you see this video but if you want
the pre-sale discount you can go to
2-hour writer.com check the link in my
description uh i go over all of my
writing systems from newsletters threads
tweets and
all of that fun stuff and i teach you
the fundamentals of writing in the
digital world i even throw in some time
management and like productivity stuff
in there so all in all if you want to
implement what we talked about today and
a lot lot more you want to understand
the depth behind everything because this
is social media this is surface level
like i gave you pretty nine pretty
in-depth stuff but there's so much more
to it it's literally my entire life
right that i need to get across to you
and show how i structure it and how you
can do it yourself so if you're
interested in writing being the
foundation of media and breaking into
this and being able to talk about
whatever you want and build an audience
then check it out link in the
description and i will see you in the
next video
