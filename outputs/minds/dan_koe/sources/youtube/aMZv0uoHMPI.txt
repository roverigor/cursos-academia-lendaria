sorry for the audio but we were just
about to record a video in the new place
and we just found this hopefully
you can see this but
that is the biggest earwig I've ever
seen in my life
oh my god
Comfort is an impermanent state that
humans love to call home
what's funny is that the longer we box
ourselves into this mental house that we
love to call home the more uncomfortable
it gets the only path to True Comfort is
by reaching the level of mind that is
comfortable with the inevitable
discomfort that life presents the
problem is this is that when most people
are faced with an uncomfortable
situation they're automatic reaction is
to flee rather than fight we may not
flee from the physical location that
we're in but our mind wants to flee
toward the mental comfort of a past
experience our mind wants to move even
if we are still this projection out of
the present moment creates tension or
can create tension not all the time but
it can create tension that unless
resolved it stays around much longer
than we'd like and the result of this is
that we it introduces the State of Mind
of feeling lost overwhelmed or just
uncertain about the future we don't know
what to pursue now next because we lack
the clarity that discomfort provides
with time and we don't we can't lean
into that discomfort in order to gain
the clarity quicker instead we fight
with it and avoid letting this
discomfort collect into the clarity that
we seek right because that's what
tension is in a sense we're overwhelmed
we're lost we're missing a piece of the
puzzle and that puzzle can only be found
with aligned movement right us moving
forward in life as our mind wants to but
in a way that is conducive toward a goal
or something else that along the way we
gather the pieces that create Clarity
and what's worse is that when we're in
this lost State it's very difficult to
zoom out and see the bigger picture it
becomes close to impossible to see
beyond the problem itself and by
narrowing in on the problem that's all
we can think about the Mind determines
how we interact with reality the Mind
how's his perspective House's perception
house is human behavior to an extent
from a very high level that is the mind
so from the top down most people have a
narrow perspective especially when
focused on a problem that leads to a
negative perception of the situation in
conducive to a goal that you don't have
Clarity on and that then that leads from
that negative perception inaccurate
decision making that only compounds it
further the goal is to move through life
with artfulness and Grace and that is to
be at one with the present moment
regardless of how the mind wants to
interpret the situation so when you
broaden your perspective by approaching
life with an open mind gain the power to
accept situations as they are reap the
joy that comes from progress you come to
the realization that you've been sold a
lie the conventional path is not the
path to the good life and to start to
understand this we have to understand
three different perspectives the space
between expectation and reality creates
tension that causes pain I love
philosophy I really do and I talk about
it a lot but I realized its flaws very
quickly and that is I realized that
theory has to meet practice you have to
ground the philosophy in reality a
philosopher can intellectualize all day
but can they run a business what happens
when that business has a fire what
happens when the businesses employees
quit what happens when the market shifts
and they have to Pivot that business
what about uh the quote-unquote
philosophers that don't call themselves
philosophers that tell you how to
attract an ideal partner or get a
boyfriend or a girlfriend or learn text
game do they actually have results to
show for it what about when you want to
start a personal brand and start writing
content check out tour writer links in
the description but then you're hesitant
to post when you're a philosopher and
you talk about
um action all day long and not
procrastinating and not becoming a slave
to the expectations in your mind and
then what happens when you make a post
and you lose a follower or you send out
an email and you lose a subscriber how
do you react to that and what about in
your practical life right what happens
if your dog dies what happens if your
brother gets kidnapped actions must
align with words this becomes more clear
When You observe society that is a very
good practice to take into your life or
adopt into your life is to just observe
Society societal patterns right there
are a bunch of Health public figures
that are not healthy there are a bunch
of people that put across a certain
notion then of course this would be a
different story if they didn't claim or
or put across all of these health things
and then their actions align with that
right if if someone's unhealthy and
they're talking about balance in life
and maybe their own philosophy about how
you incorporate more food for a specific
reason and they don't prioritize Health
then yeah actions start to align with
words but if there is someone that has
the credentials of a health person and
that's how they position themselves
right that's how they frame so others
can share that perspective of them they
can share minds but the actions don't
align then the the there's a dissonance
there where somebody else's actions
aren't going to align with that specific
perspective and it's going to create
that tension and it's going to cause
them to feel lost negative overwhelmed
and they aren't going to get results
this happens all the time in more than
just Health where business people they
put across something this is why I've
stopped selling specific courses is
because I no longer do them right
there's things that I can teach based on
principles of the past but the things
that I talk about and sell now hopefully
I try to have them align with what I do
and the goals that I'm trying to achieve
and the shared goals that I'm attracting
people with my content like this so the
best philosophy is that which is
grounded in reality and that is
individual right we can blame people all
day long for their lack of of lack of
congruence but at the end of the day I
found that creating your own philosophy
and living by that and not taking
prescriptions or hard set advice from
other people until you test it and see
how it fits in your life and what parts
fit in your life right I can give you
business advice all day long but there's
going to be certain things that don't
apply to your situation or they don't
resonate with your level of mind and
they aren't going to be conducive toward
action and they're only going to cause
that overwhelm so you have to be able to
understand what we're talking about in
this video reframe things act on the
things that will help and then
internalize that knowledge or philosophy
that you are picking up along the way so
the first perspective that we need to go
over is expectation versus reality
expectations are beliefs and these
expectations are often conditioned into
our mind as we go about life from a
young age and expectation is the
assumption that something should or will
happen so Western children are often
told that they should go after a high
paying job or become a doctor or a
lawyer or something like that with a
high-paying job title kids are told that
they will go to church on Sunday and
they'll believe it or they won't and
they'll Rebel and that will create
tension and overwhelm and uncertainty
and it will lead them down a different
path hopefully a good one if they can
zoom out and critically think and try to
act in a beneficial manner for their
future so expectations narrow our mind
towards a predictable future and what
this does is it closes off potentially
closes off our mind to other potential
Futures because it's already set right
it's already gonna happen we aren't able
to zoom out beyond that and think of
different paths in life and so in
especially in like Western Society where
the typical thing is go to school get a
job retire at 65 that's an expectation
that a lot of people have and so they
Outsource their ability to act on other
things to that and they try to their
actions follow suit with those
expectations and it usually leads to a
life of more suffering not like absolute
suffering I don't believe that people
are miserable all the time but you can
see what I mean here and it's just
obvious if you observe Society the pain
that following these preset expectations
that Society has projected on you can
lead to and so from this narrow
perspective that these expectations
create it influences our perception of a
situation and then that influences our
the choices that we make and those are
narrowly aligned with the perspective
that we hold that is narrowed by
expectations and choices are the bricks
that build your future self and life so
let's take a look at someone as an
example that has a lot of responsibility
but they want to start a business I see
this all the time they see others with
little responsibility flexing their
business success within 6 to 12 months
as an example they hold that expectation
in their mind without context for their
situation they conceptualize why they
can't do the same and how life is unfair
because they have a job kids and a
spouse they fail to face the reality of
their own situation and the reality is
is that they didn't hop on the
opportunity earlier in in their life and
you can't change that it's fine it's
like what else are you going to do you
can't go back in time and change it and
the sooner you accept reality for what
it is and your specific situation and
open your mind to the potential
opportunities that are available to you
the sooner you can perceive this entire
situation from a more conducive lens and
then your actions can follow suit even
if making that business progress is
going to take a much longer time than
the person that started earlier than you
because the sooner you start the sooner
you can suck less and the sooner you can
see more results even if the time
Horizon is just a tiny bit longer than
the person that had a bit less
responsibility and so that's the other
thing is they're able to rather than
adopting the goal or the expectation of
another person that they see online they
can zoom out create their own perceive
the situation from a better Manner and
then search for aligned mentors
education and advice that will help them
Reach that goal in their specific
situation and you're going to have to
search for this stuff it's can't be
prescribed or given to you this is like
a good aspect of why in business people
tell you to Niche down I'm more of of
the line where it's you Niche down
towards a goal that you can help people
achieve because then people with that
shared goal and similar situations then
you can navigate between that a lot
easier but even then hard set
prescriptive actionable advice is not
always I would say like a majority of
the time most advice you see is not
going to apply to your situation you
have to be able to extract the essence
or the truth of what's being said there
and then apply it to your own the
context of your situation so the next
perspective that we need to go over is
concept versus experience so the prime
example of this first we have to
understand that reality is experience
everything is experience and all
Concepts knowledge Etc are layers over
experience that's what they come from
right you can't you can't label
something until you've experienced it
and so the the common
example here is the concept of God right
there are many different concepts but
God is like the Western one I would
argue that it has the most like
misunderstanding behind it it's a
concept that is pointing towards an
experience God Brahman Infinity the
universe whatever lens or religion you
want to paint it under it is an
experience and so religious people
attach to this concept as you would
adopt like an expectation for the future
this is a concept you attach to a
concept or you identify with a concept
and then it causes unnecessary tension
when people disagree with you on that
concept because experience is personal
and so the difference here which can be
like another perspective is knowing
versus understanding concepts allow you
to know experience allows you to
understand and knowledge is a layer on
top of reality to understand it right
it's a symbol it's representative of an
experience and then understanding is an
inherent aspect of human consciousness
it is in internal versus external right
this is one unique thing about human
consciousness along with like our depth
of focus our ability to build our
ability to plan into the future this is
another characteristic that sets a human
being apart from other beings is the
ability to understand that every single
person has so people love to
conceptualize or know things without
actually moving forward in Life or
experiencing things in life right this
is the classic definition of an armchair
philosopher and the reason behind this
is because it's uncomfortable to
actually move forward in life and solve
problems and go out and Achieve goals
because that
is going to lead to you experiencing
more of The Human Experience right
something that we're here to do I would
argue but you aren't going to do that if
you just conceptualize and build layers
on top of reality all day long into this
mental house or intellectual structure
that you can just live in and build a
little bubble of mental comfort that you
reside in so the last perspective is
what is versus what isn't it is what it
is is the most profound statement you
will hear in your life but few people
realize the depth behind it making a
distinction between what is and what
isn't is a great way to close the gap
between expectation and reality as well
as concept from experience so the
present moment or what's right in front
of you or your direct experience is the
only thing that is that's what is so you
can think all day long about how going
to the gym is going to be difficult but
the only thing that really is difficult
quote unquote that can't be labeled is
the difficulty of let's say a dumbbell
in your hand as you're nearing the last
rep that is the experience of difficulty
that is what is when you are in that
moment and anything aside from that is
what isn't when you're conceptualizing
and thinking and projecting about how
difficult leg day is going to be and
then you you think about that and you
think that you're experiencing it or you
may experience the negative emotion like
associated with that but you're not
experiencing the sensory perception of
that experience itself and that is
creating attention and is going to lead
to in conducive action like you possibly
not going to the gym when you didn't
even do the difficult thing it's not
difficult if you aren't actually doing
it right and the struggle of building a
name for yourself let's say with a
personal brand is what is but anything
aside from that review thinking about
how I can't start a business how I don't
have enough skills how I can't do this
this and this and this that's what is
isn't that's not the actual experience
that you're going to be able to extract
a lesson from a personal lesson from one
that can't be taught to you except for
by you and of course if you want help
with this Link's in the description for
digital economics to actually start
experiencing this stuff when you have
the knowledge in order to understand the
experience as you go into it right don't
take the course if you're not actually
going to act on it and so I'm not saying
that Concepts or expectations or what
isn't are all bad they're definitely not
bad they're very useful but they should
be treated as guides right when they are
perceived from a negative light and you
get trapped and your mind closes and it
causes you we're talking about being in
a state of stress overwhelm anxiety
feeling lost
Etc that way too many people are stuck
in and you being able to navigate your
way out by understanding the distinction
between expectation and reality and
that's exactly the point the beliefs are
expect locations or concepts or just the
the things that you're bouncing around
in your head are not reality it's not
the experience that is unfolding right
in front of you and you have the ability
to
pay closer attention this is what all
the spiritual Masters are getting at
this is why meditation is a good
practice to at least test or adopt into
your life is because it gets you out of
your head and it gets you into reality
and it allows you to navigate the
concepts expectations that allow us to
move towards positive potential Futures
in reality in another sense what I'm
saying here is that you can clean your
room
and you can clean your room well even if
you don't feel like cleaning it and feel
free to exchange clean your room with
any given activity that you're
preventing yourself from doing no
problem can be solved from the same
level of Consciousness that created it
problems are an inherent part of life
they're baked into the system and
problems are the spark that create this
gap between expectation and reality
especially if you do not have the skill
to match the challenge that a specific
situation presents and only once you
close that Gap and actually see the
problems for what they are is when you
can solve them better because that
requires you to zoom out and adopt a
higher perspective in order to perceive
the problems therefore you're increasing
your level of Consciousness or in this
case we're going to frame it as your
level of mind and here we will Define
mind as how you interact with reality so
think of perspective or like the the
level of your mind as the thing that
houses all of your beliefs ideas
Concepts skills experience
potentialities for the future so what
you think is possible and other things
like that so the broader this
perspective becomes the more you
increase your level of mind and that
means you are able to view problems from
a better lens and it becomes difficult
to latch on to a specific expectation or
concept or other thing because you've
adopted
so many different you've experimented
with without
identification or latching on to any
specific expectations or concepts or
ideologies or beliefs right you've
broken out of that bubble multiple times
in your life and so the way that you
increase your level of Mind Is by
solving problems and so with every
problem you solve you're able to
perceive life from a much more
effortless or enjoyable lens because you
understand that the problem can be
solved and you know that there is a way
to solve it and so the degrees of
problems that you are facing is a prime
indicator of what level of mind you have
and what phase of life you are in if you
are stuck in all of these surface level
problems that you've yet to solve like
fixing your health fixing your bank
account fixing your relationships coming
after those two and fixing your
emotional intelligence or your happiness
because once you solve those things or
once you master your survival then you
reach this specific level of Mind where
you can be more creative you can
navigate the world with more artfulness
and Grace and so what I'm trying to say
here is that you need to
solve more problems in your life that's
kind of what life is all about that's
what this entire universe is all about
throughout Evolution that's like if we
were to consider the phases of evolution
or the stages of evolution on the same
scale where that is the level of the
collective mind evolving by solving
problems that's what I mean here so in
order for you to personally evolve you
have to increase your level of mind and
that is done by solving the problems in
your life so then once you master
survival you can move on to joining
these Collective minds or communities
helping other people and putting your
mind together with a shared goal in
order to solve a bigger problem in this
world and help Humanity evolve by
solving problems and increasing the
collective level of mind and so with
every problem you solve you'll be forced
to or you will have to in order to solve
it decrease and close the gap between
expectation and reality and each time
you do you'll be presented with a lesson
so that you can navigate those problems
easier in the future this is how you
gain experience and then this experience
can be transferred into business because
products solve problems that that's what
business is you're solving problems uh
for other people in exchange for a
valuable resource and in this case that
resource would be money but can be many
other things this is just what we're
using right now in this day and age in
the past it used to be you trade you
barter it's the exchange of goods and
money is a very valuable good right now
and so with this Logic the higher your
experience or the more problems you've
solved in your life the more profitable
your business becomes and so I'm not
saying that like you don't have the
experience to start helping people now
because you're at a specific level of
mind right if you've done any form of
self-development or self-improvement you
have the experience to be able to help
someone that's right behind you and I do
recommend doing that from the the start
because teaching helps you solve
problems in your life better that helps
you gain more experience because you're
you're pulling Minds together and then
that opens up more problems to solve
especially when they aren't like
directly personal to you and so there
has to be a balance with this or a
progression right because that's just
another expectation where it's like I
want to climb Mount Everest but I'm not
going to do so because that takes like I
I can't do it how am I going to do it
I'm going to run out of breath in the
first mile you can't climb Mount Everest
if you can't even walk 10K steps every
single day as you open yourself to
living at your Edge your deepest purpose
will slowly begin to make itself known
in the meantime you will experience
layer after layer of purposes each one
getting closer and closer to the
fullness of your deepest purpose so to
reach new levels of mind you have to
encounter problems you have to live at
your Edge you have to encounter or go
after the goals and problems that you
are actually able to solve that are
closer the expectation that comes from
the goal because problems and goals like
they don't exist without each other you
encounter a problem and then a goal is
implied to overcome that problem and in
order to close the gap that the
expectation that the goal
gives you right like I want to make a
hundred thousand dollars that's an
expectation that I have in my mind and
it when that Gap is closed by solving
the subsequent problems that present
themselves one after another after
another step-by-step tiny change after
tiny change Choice after choice because
you are now viewing the problems from
the lens of the goal right it gives you
a better perspective to view your
problems from then that is how you live
at your Edge right because you you have
to take on the challenges that you are
able to and so in order to solve these
problems you actually have to do things
that increase your level of skill to
allow you to solve them and to acquire
the the knowledge or the skill to view
the problem from a better light in order
to solve it so let's run through some
steps let's make this practical how do
you increase your level of Mind how do
you make life easier to live how do you
gain Clarity on the situation you're in
and how do you start overcoming that
feeling of feeling overwhelmed lost
anxious whatever it may be that is
preventing you from acting towards a
more beneficial future so the first step
is to pursue a challenging goal and I'm
talking challenging I'm not talking
impossible for your current state of
mind and this is a lesson it's funny
because it's all goals right human
behaviors goals marketing is goals
desired goal path to get there and
problem that is preventing you from
doing so that's literally the
foundational principle of everything
that's offer creation that's how you
plan your days on the micro scale that's
how you set a vision for your future and
act on the micro scale that's how you
organize moving through the world is
desired goal the path to get there that
you have to create Clarity on and if the
goal is too high or it's too far away
then you're going to have to create more
steps or you're going to have to lower
the goal and perceive the problem
accompanying problem from that better
lens so you need a goal that you can act
on every single day not one that is
assigned to you like a job you need to
work on your own goals that solve the
problems in your life every single day
there needs to be least a 30 to 60
Minute time block and so if you haven't
started or you're at the beginner phase
I'm assuming that your goals are going
to revolve around health wealth
relationships you're going to have to
either start in the gym or you're going
to have to start improving your finances
or I wouldn't I would recommend doing
this afterwards so you can approach it
from a better light but you're going to
have to progress in order to be able to
solve the relationship problems in your
life and so peace of mind is a byproduct
of pursuing these goals not necessarily
achieving them right there's in Greek
philosophy or the Greeks they they made
the distinction between uh telek and
atelic activities and Telos is the Greek
word for goal right so telek and atelic
are
different but they're the different
states of being right where there's uh
doing nothing and then there's doing and
when you're doing the the way you reap
fulfillment from It Is by focusing still
on the present moment while holding the
goal in the back of your mind so you're
still moving towards something but
you're not focused on the expectation
you're focused on the reality of the
situation and so another thing you have
to understand is that everything in life
evolves right your goals are going to
evolve so once you uh actualize one
you're gonna have to set another and so
the the Second Step while you were
pursuing your goals is to stay conscious
of present moment difficulty so what
judgments or connotations do you attach
to the words struggle difficulty
uncomfortableness and heart do they lead
to Compulsive thoughts about the future
do you immediately jump to an
expectation of what they are maybe they
lead to a memory of a past mistake one
that causes fear to the point of
inaction or maybe a mixture of both
leaving you in a Vortex of anxiety so
these things are not reality when you're
projecting out so you have to stay you
have to stay conscious of present moment
difficulty right the senses the you you
can't start projecting into the future
if you're running on a treadmill and
things start to get hard you have to
stay focused on the actual sensories
perceptions that you're experiencing and
not the expectations that you hold in
your mind about how it should be or you
have to become conscious of the
expectations in your mind where oh this
should be easy this shouldn't be that
difficult I should be doing something
better with my time I don't want to do
this I could be walking right now all of
these little things that pop up are not
the reality of the situation and the
reality of the situation with these
steps are going to be the things that
actualize the goals that you want to
achieve so the third and most powerful
step here is that you will hit a
critical point so this is the perception
threshold the perception threshold is a
time when difficult becomes enjoyable
after you push through the the
discomfort of a situation so you can see
hear that it starts where there isn't
much perceived difficulty understand
that this is perceived it's not the
actual difficulty of the situation and
as you keep going the perceived
difficulty gets higher as your mind
starts to narrow in on these little
things going on in your head and then
once you accept reality for what it is
and what is happening at that moment
then the perceived difficulty right not
the difficulty of the actual actual
situation but the thing in your mind
that is going to make you stop decreases
and then you can start to find more
enjoyment in the actual difficulty of
the reality of the situation because it
isn't not supposed to be there if you
have writer's block if you're 30 minutes
into a 5K run if you're on your last rep
of a 365 pound squat if you're hesitant
to post your P first piece of content if
you're 45 minutes into a meditation
session and your mind is begging you to
check your notifications thoughts and
emotions will flood your mind and in
these cases the only way out is through
so another thing here is that you have
to train your pain tolerance by taking
on an increasing level of challenge
right because you're not going to go and
try and meditate for an hour because
that's just it's going to be very
difficult and your pain tolerance is
going to be low to the point where
you're not going to hit that perception
threshold and in another sense it's like
when you're hit when you hit the
runner's high when you're on a jog and
eventually it's like oh I hit my stride
it's time to go it's because
the perception threshold and so this may
take five minutes it may take a day and
it may take a year it may take a
lifetime depending on the actual state
of the problem all problems are
different and require a different amount
of time to solve chaos is a prerequisite
to Clarity and Clarity is the most
potent fuel in the world so step number
four is that you reach a new level of
mind so crossing the perception
threshold forces you to zoom out beyond
the little web of beliefs and thoughts
that you have in your head to adopt a
higher perspective so that you can
actually see the problem for what it is
or see the difficulty for what it is so
not having ideas for your writing
becomes a silly excuse not performing
the last rep that leads to the most
gains becomes I'm being a little
pushed through and not posting your
first piece of content becomes if I
don't do this it becomes habit and I'll
be stuck in my current situation for
life which is the opposite of what I
want deep satisfaction is the result
from the this process so that's it for
this video we talked about writing and
difficulty with writing so if you want
to practice that check out two or two
hour writer Link in the description has
Theory but it is backed with practice so
you can face this difficulty head-on
there's other stuff down there that you
can check out along the way uh like
subscribe comment I hope you like the
new setup it'll probably change in a few
videos from now but
that is it for this video see
