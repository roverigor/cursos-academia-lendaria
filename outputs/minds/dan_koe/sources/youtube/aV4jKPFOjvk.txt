when I was in college trying to become a
fitness YouTuber of all things I came
across a popular book title by Tim
Ferriss the four hour work week I'm sure
every single one of you know that I've
never read the book but when I first saw
the title I interpreted it as the four
hour work day and so ever since that the
idea of a four hour work day stuck in
the back of my head throughout my life
college experience uh business failures
and everything leading up until this
point so along the way my subconscious
mind was kind of munching on Creative
problems because I perceived anything
more than four hours of work a day as a
problem and this alone changed the
direction of my life and really
everything I do and all of the decisions
that I made now when I say that four
hours of work a day or anything more
than that was seen as a problem I don't
mean like it was the end of the world I
just mean that I knew that I was able to
achieve some form of success with only
four hours or less worth of work per day
and so my mind naturally wanted to come
up with Solutions relating to that
whenever my work extended Beyond four
hours of work a day so in business as
I've talked about many times before it's
like when you just start out and you're
getting into freelancing or you start an
agency or you learn a skill it's very
wise to start a service based business
first something where you are in direct
control of the Outreach right you aren't
reliant on an audience or paid ads or
something like that to drive traffic to
a product and instead you have a skill
and you create a valuable offer and you
iterate on that with time until you can
charge more and more and more and
eventually you reach out to people you
start Landing clients maybe you're
building an audience along the way and
then that is able to fuel your client
acquisition but it gets to a point where
you have an audience that's large enough
to productize right and systemize so
that you can still maintain a four-hour
work workday but if you continue Landing
clients without doing that you can see
where the problem starts to arise right
because then you've built yourself into
some form of a new nine to five where
you have a bunch of clients you're
making a good amount of money but
there's still a cap there's still a
limited amount that you can make without
just working 16 hours a day and so this
is what I mean by perceiving it as a
problem and consistently working to
evolve which we'll talk about soon and
systemize that so when I got to a
certain point where I realized okay it's
time to start moving in a New Direction
because if I keep like I can't just take
on unlimited amounts of clients I have
to be able to deliver and do other
things so that's what I did is once I
reached a certain point I took on less
clients I productized my service and I
had built an audience to the point where
I could sell that product and that
required much less work on my hands so
in business it comes from systemization
of your workflow so that you can work
faster and more efficiently and it comes
from eliminating things that just don't
make too much sense to do or delegating
or Outsourcing low leverage tasks and
working on the things that you actually
want to work on right you can Outsource
the things that you hate and so for the
past three years I would argue that
ninety percent of my days were under
four hours of work a day I'm not saying
that this is absolutely foolproof and
that you're not gonna go over four hours
of work you're going to be able to like
you can work as long as you want right
I'd like to like right now I'm probably
working six hours a day maybe but I do
see that as a problem it's not affecting
me in a negative way but I know that at
some point I'm going to have to
systemize in order to maintain a
specific Baseline while working four
hours a day so as an example of that is
if I'm making twenty thousand dollars a
month or let's say ten thousand dollars
a month and then I hit a new high of
twenty thousand dollars a month because
I saw an opportunity and I started
adding on more work let's say six hours
of work a day in order to reach that
then I have to system I eyes and come
back down a little bit so then you keep
moving your Baseline up so your four
hours of work are going a longer way and
making more money or whatever the end
goal is whether it's money or not to the
point of you being able to make a lot
more money while only working four hours
of work a day it's like bulking and
cutting when you bulk and you're eating
in a caloric Surplus and you're in a
state of growth and in this case
business growth you're going to tack on
a bit of fat in your business the things
that kind of bog you down and make you
have to work more and so when the
cutting season comes and you want to cut
back to let's say 15 body fat in
business and be able to sit there
comfortably while working four hours a
day that is necessary you don't just get
stuck at one single part of the journey
you evolve and so to preface before we
dive into some evolutionary psychology
and philosophy before we get into the
Ten Commandments of the four hour work
day I want to preface that if you have a
job job this is mainly for people that
are creators right and they have more
time on their hands but if you have a
job this is going to have to be limited
to like one hour a day and maybe four
hours on the weekend if you have that
time and if you just don't give a
about starting a business right now you
can use this for your work as well when
I was working a job at a web design
agency I would usually knock out my work
in like two to three hours and then I
would just screw around or work on my
business for the rest of the time so all
of this is about saving time on the
things that you're working on to free up
more time for the more priorities in
your life so why is this important there
are a few things and the one being that
there are a few qualities that separate
humans from other beings like one of
them that has fascinated me is how
humans survive more so on a conceptual
level while animals survive on a
physical level like you wouldn't see a
giraffe getting offended because it
doesn't have the same beliefs as you and
so if you are
trying to survive the idea or belief of
the four hour work day that is going to
be much more powerful for actually
making it happen right you kind of have
to identify with it in a good way right
this is what spiritual teachers tell you
not to do words do not attach your
identity to something because that
becomes a part of yourself and you're
going to work to survive it and if that
is static then it is going to cause some
form of unnecessary suffering in your
life but this can be spun for good and
you can create a positive identity that
is going to lead to a better future and
the struggles and pain that you face are
going to be learning experiences for
creating a system that is better for
better and more conducive for reaching
your desired lifestyle and so that's the
first thing the second thing that
fascinates me about humans versus other
beings is their depth of focus our depth
of focus is crazy and it goes a lot
deeper than I can go into in this video
but so in Psychology there is the task
positive network of the brain which
happens when you you are focused on an
external string of tasks this is good
for productivity there's also the
default mode Network which happens when
you take your focus off of the external
so something like work and you focus you
bring your focus to the internal and
this opens your awareness and allows
better ideas to fill your brain or
negative ideas but this is good for
creativity and so this balance between
narrow external focus and more internal
open Focus we can look at a graphic that
I've made before called the focus Matrix
because there are negative aspects to
focus right it's not all productivity
and creativity there's unconscious
narrow or open focus on the left which
you can see leads to stress anxiety
reactivity annoyance feeling lost
feeling uncertain feeling overwhelmed
and then on the right there's conscious
narrow and open Focus which is more
efficient task oriented associated with
the flow State present creative relaxed
and joyful so keep this in mind as
you're going about all of this because
it's a helpful guide when you become
aware or conscious of your current state
so if you feel lost or you feel stressed
or you feel anxious there's a reason
behind that and you can work towards
moving your focus in the other direction
towards something positive usually by
eliminating distractions and focusing on
the task at hand evolution is forced on
us by the fact that systems fall apart
with time unless they become more
efficient We Can't Stop and remain in
the same place even to remain still we
must advance so this is another reason
why this productivity system is
important is that humans we have a
natural desire to know more the curse of
knowledge we have an endless thirst to
learn things that will Aid in our
survival and so with our unique minds
and with this knowledge we build systems
to solve problems that lead to better
outcomes in all domains of life Society
culture personal life whatever it may be
as an example it took a lot of energy
physical energy to carry water in
plowfield so we used our creative
ability and our minds to create a
solution like a tractor and a system for
being able to use that energy more
efficiently so let me introduce you to
the supreme law of the universe which is
entropy some call this Nature's tax and
in brief entropy is the measure of
disorder in a system so you have to
understand that the productivity system
that we're going to be creating here is
important for the survival and evolution
of our work because we create systems to
Aid in evolution so a system it has an
end goal or an outcome and then it has a
process or steps in order to reach that
outcome and systems unless fueled with a
specific energy or the energy has to
have specific qualities to it so in your
body you can fuel your body the system
of your body with junk food but that
energy isn't very quality it doesn't
really meet the demands that your
individual body needs and so when you
fill it with clean Foods or whatever uh
healthy diet that you can fill it with
and give it the proper nutrients through
that energy helps upkeep your body so in
something like productivity is when
you're trying to reach the outcome of a
stable and revenue generating business
then you are going to have to fuel that
system with the correct energy in the
forms of focused prioritized action and
so another fun fact is that these
systems lay over each other they're just
layers upon layers right like a
paragraph is a goal to the system of
sentences and words are a system that
create sentences so we'll dive into this
more in a future episode but just start
thinking of everything as a system
notice the goal notice the steps on how
they're going to get there and then
notice that energy required to maintain
that system without it falling apart so
an example would be a librarian right
you have a library they have a system
for organizing books and making them
easy to find and then they have steps
for themselves or the employees to
continuously uh rent out take back in
organize the books in a way that makes
sense and reduces that system from
tending toward disorder or chaos but if
you have a home bookshelf and you take
out one book and then another and they
end up scattered around the house and
you never put the energy or effort
necessary to maintain order in that
system or if you don't have a system for
organizing it at all then the attention
the mental energy as well necessary to
maintain that system in the order in
your mind is going to fail so this isn't
only the system that is external but it
is how your mind interacts with that
system because that's how you order
Consciousness that's how you bring
Clarity to your mind and allow yourself
to act alright so let's dive into the
four hour philosophy or my Ten
Commandments for focused work okay so
let's talk about the four hour
philosophy in short we already mentioned
this but humans survive on a conceptual
level so if you identify or you hold the
idea of a four hour work day in the back
of your mind somewhere and associate
yourself with being able to work four
hours a day then you're going to try to
survive that identity you're going to
feel threatened when something threatens
that belief or that system of yours and
you are going to work to try and survive
it and be able to make better decisions
in a way that allows you to productize
systemize or just maintain four hours of
focused work a day so why four hours one
these conceptual systems or beliefs or
ideas that we're trying to survive with
our mind they require mental energy they
require attention and at the start this
is going to be very draining right you
aren't going to have a way of organizing
your mind to the point of being able to
act on this consistently you have to
test and refine and iterate and from
personal experience and anecdotes from
friends and just scientific studies it
seems like three four five three to five
hours of focused work a day is what
humans can have before they need to just
give their focus a break because as we
with everything literally everything you
need to train it it's like a muscle
focus is a muscle you're not going to be
able to do it very well at the start
you're going to be able to focus for
like 20 minutes and then you're going to
have to take a break and come back and
train that with time until all of this
becomes habit because one thing that I
forgot to mention earlier about systems
is that once they are refined once they
have been repeated or conditioned into
your head and formed those grooves in
the neural networks of your brain they
become automatic they become routine and
normal to you and that's kind of how you
automate the path to the good life is
just by continuously layering system
over system in your life that is going
to lead to a better future and so
another thing is that when you limit
yourself to only four hours a day that
kind of acts as a pseudo deadline right
it's not as powerful as having like a
real world deadline that you actually
have to meet but just limiting yourself
to four hours and knowing that you don't
have to work more than four hours it
will shrink time and according to
Parkinson's law where work matches the
time or whatever it is you're going to
try and fit your work within those four
hours so that was why four hours the
second thing is vision and identity so
this is for a future video entirely
because it's such an important topic but
you need a vision for your future and
the way that I like to paint this is
that you need a minimum viable Vision
like a minimum viable product in
business you just need to get it out so
that you can make connections when you
have certain experiences and are able to
associate ideas with that and make it
better with time you can do the same for
your vision for the future so write out
the following and be as specific and
detailed as you can who you want to be
what you want to do for work where you
want to live what your ideal day looks
like how you will contribute to humanity
what people you will surround yourself
with network and Social Circle and feel
free to let the stream of Consciousness
keep going with this and so the point
here is to set a foundation for the
goals that you're going to try to be
achieving on a daily basis with your
productivity system what you're going to
be working towards because that's a huge
problem is that people just don't have
an intrinsic goal that they're trying to
achieve they go and they adopt the goal
of someone else because it's Clarity
that someone else has created like a job
or something else and then they give
their mental energy to that and align
their work with that and then eventually
they're so deep in this meta system
called society that their attention is
just enslaved in that and they don't
have any time to go and create something
for themselves so it's going to take a
lot longer so commandment number three
is to Outline Three priority tasks so
this is situation dependent I can't tell
you what your lever moving tasks are
going to be but what you need to do is
you need to understand what you're
trying to achieve from a very big
picture not technical details so if you
want to start a Creator business or a
one-person business like I've talked
about multiple times you could go and
watch my videos because they are big
picture rundowns and then you can start
testing from there and so in terms of my
levers for my stage in business again
this is context dependent and situation
dependent based on what's going to move
you to move you towards your goals
depending on what stage you're in stage
of development you're in in business so
my first priority task is always writing
content I wake up and I write my
newsletter and tweets and threads for 45
minute blocks each so about two 45
minute blocks 90 minutes total 45 being
my newsletter and then 45 being like
tweets threads posting to other
platforms Etc because writing forms the
foundation of literally everything I do
if you want to learn how I create
content and how I script things how I
write tweets how I grow other things
like that check out the two hour writer
Link in the description the second
priority task is generating traffic
because with content what I'm doing is
I'm creating content I'm attracting
people I'm putting media on the internet
that will hopefully bring people to
follow me and then potentially buy my
products and just dive deeper into the
free content that I give out but
generating traffic because this is true
with any social media platform that you
start on you're not going to have much
traffic at the start nobody's going to
see your content so you need to focus
most of your effort on just generating
traffic to your content whether that be
networking in the DMS or making friends
with people that will potentially share
your posts or just replying to Big
accounts like if I went and replied I
set Bell notifications for every single
YouTuber that has a high subscriber
count and I went and commented on those
every single morning and I blocked out
time to do that in my focused work then
I'm going to be moving a lever because
I'm bringing traffic to my profile and
my content over time and so right now
I'm doing this on LinkedIn and sometimes
other platforms like sometimes Instagram
mostly LinkedIn because that's my the
platform that is lagging the most for me
and so I'm putting more effort into
growth rather than just monotonous
content creation there so number three
is promoting my products be because I
have to make an income if I want to do
this full time and so with consistent
traffic being generated from the content
and my efforts into growing those actual
platforms then I can start to lead that
traffic into either free products to
build Authority more and just give out
free value or I can lead them into
something like the tour writer or
digital economics or modern Mastery for
those that want those things in specific
and my products are good and I put a lot
of time into them so it only makes sense
that I promote them so more people get
results from them so at my phase in
business those are the three things that
are most important to me and of course
there are auxiliary tasks that I have to
complete but those are usually towards
the end when I have like a an hour to
spare it before my four hours of focus
work are up so commandment number four
is to gain Clarity on those lever moving
tasks most people think they need
motivation when in reality they need
Clarity and so every weekend let's say
Saturday Sunday I usually swap a few of
my lever moving task for a Clarity
generating task so on Sundays I outline
my newsletters I'll plan my week I'll do
things like that I'll write down ideas
for tweets ideas for Threads ideas for
Content what I need to do to keep things
moving with my products like modern
Mastery what's the content going to be
in there and a bunch of things like that
and then outside of those that are hard
scheduled I usually go on multiple walks
a day which I use for clarity so in the
afternoon at like 11 I'll go on a 30 to
45 minute walk and I'll just listen to
lectures and I'll generate ideas for
Content then sometimes I'll even write
on my phone right if I'm not in a busy
area I can just go on a walk and like
outline stuff on my phone and so I talk
about this balance a lot in my fill mtus
video which I'll link here that's about
my whole daily routine rather than just
focus work routine and so the main
question to ask here is how can you use
one to two hours of your week to set
yourself up for seamless work sessions
so commandment number five is time
blocks and breaks so the Pomodoro
Technique is very popular because it's
it's very good but I found something
different that works well for me so at
the start before any of this becomes
habit you should very heavily consider
writing this on your calendar you need
to make it real you need to take it out
of your mind and you need to put it
somewhere physical whether that be on
your calendar in a notebook on a sticky
note on your uh computer you just need
to make it known because you're forming
a new habit here it's going to take some
work and so what I like to do is I
usually like to schedule things in 90
minute blocks and so what I'll do is
I'll sit down with my priority tasks
let's say it's writing content and I'll
set a timer
I have one back there it's like a little
kitchen timer I'll put 45 minutes on it
and I'll press start and then I'll write
without any distraction that timer when
that timer is on there's no tabs open
it's just like what I need only to get
the writing done and then once that
timer goes off I'll reevaluate okay did
I complete this what's next and I'll set
the timer for another 45 minutes and
then once those 90 minutes are done I'll
go I'll get up I'll go walk outside
either a 30 minute walk or if I'm not
feeling like doing 30 minutes then I'll
go for 10 minutes the main thing is to
just get up and realign and bring your
intention and attention to a new
priority task so commandment number six
is to manipulate deadlines deadlines
narrow your attention and the more
narrow your attention is the less likely
distractions are going to register in
your awareness and it's the same thing
with the negative side of the spectrum
we saw the focus Matrix graphic earlier
we're on the left unconscious focus when
it's narrow when you're narrowed in on a
problem nothing else is going to
distract you from that problem no other
problems are going to pop into your head
unless you like see one problem then
that leads to the next and you're like
oh no and then your focus starts to open
up and you're drowning in all of these
problems but on the positive side of
things when you have Clarity on what
you're trying to do and you are narrowed
in on one specific task and no
distractions can penetrate just because
you're so immersed in it that's when you
start to kick into flow so you can see
the deadline as a challenge as well and
so four hours of Total work and then 90
minute time blocks with those 45 minute
timers those are kind of like pseudo
deadlines those also narrow your
attention you can also put something
tangible on the line when you really
need to get something done so one thing
that I've done that just works miracles
is public deadlines another reason to
build an audience whenever I launch a
product I'll usually do it pre-sale and
then what I'll do is I'll have it all
mapped out of course but I'll put a
promotion out and when I get the first
sale that means like okay it's
go time and if that deadline is like a
month out then I have a month to get
everything done and usually closer to
when that month comes that's when I'm
spending like 12 hours a day just
unbroken Focus for my computer getting
 done and so get creative with this
it's going to take a bit of uh thinking
and creativity but how can you add a
deadline to your important work so
commandment number seven is to
manipulate your environment so your
environment and everything leading up to
your focus work sessions need to come
into play here or at least you just need
to be conscious of them so if you're
doing Focus work in the morning which I
recommend which we'll get into are you
setting yourself up to be undistracted
by the time that you get to your desk do
you have a routine of okay I'm going to
do this brush my teeth take out the dog
make coffee and get straight into work
because when you have that that allows
you to get out of bed so much easier
because you're not sitting there
wondering okay what should I do I have
30 minutes to spare until I start
working I'm just gonna sit here and then
I'm gonna waste time and then I'm gonna
be over on my work time
etc etc and so that helps reduce
decision fatigue going into the work
itself but then when the work itself
comes up you have to make sure and
prepare for potential distractions so if
it helps to put your phone on the other
side of the room do that if it helps to
wear a hat to narrow your attention
which actually does help wear a hat if
it helps to wear noise canceling
headphones try it out test it none of
this is set in stone in its life is a
process of iteration and growth and
evolution and so as long as you're
working to make this process better for
yourself you're going to be in a good
spot as long as you're becoming aware of
the problems that are preventing you
from working in efficient four hours and
working to change and improve those
problems then you're doing fine so the
question is how can you manipulate your
environment to conserve mental energy
for your priority tasks and now
commandment number eight which is my
favorite is wake up before distractions
because there seems to be two main
perspectives when it comes to like the
hustle and grind culture just waking up
early is that some people are very Pro
waking up at like four or five a.m and
then some people are very Pro I get up
whenever I want and then I start working
and then it gets done and you can do
whatever you want try it out but unless
you try waking up early I wouldn't talk
smack about it or just like write it off
entirely the hours of like five to seven
in the morning are sacred there is
nothing that can distract you it's very
peaceful even if you're a night owl and
your brain is in more of that default
mode Network open Focus State because
you're very sleepy you can set priority
tasks related to creativity rather than
just being hyper productive during that
time because in those sacred hours no
one's going to be calling you no one's
going to be texting you even if they are
it's so early that you don't feel
obligated to respond uh the day isn't
going to be started you're not going to
be getting invites to lunch you're not
going to be really uh pressured to eat
because you're like oh I haven't eaten
breakfast yet or I haven't eaten lunch I
need to get that done and then I'll come
back to work so wait wake up before the
distractions commandment number nine is
to prioritize rest quality work does not
exist without quality rest it's that
simple but as we've discussed previously
rest is not the modern notion of
self-care the thing that is perpetuated
by mediocre people online so rest does
not mean Netflix wine and bubble baths
those have their place of course but
rest equals regenerating mental energy
through non-work related activities an
example of some of these are going to
the gym going on a walk socializing with
Friends riding in your Journal reading a
good book or just trying out a new hobby
whatever takes your focus off of work
and allows you to bring it more
intrinsic to the things that you want to
do so in reality anything that doesn't
support your work or mediocrity or a
cheap dopamine addiction and so another
important thing here is that when the
four hours are up you stop working dead
stop you do not work any longer unless
the priority tasks
move over or spill over and then you're
working to systemize that back into four
hours of work but if it's just busy work
and you going on your computer to
accomplish little tasks here and there
that can wait you need to get into the
habit of stopping work and not focusing
on work this is so much more important
than I can make it seem in this video
because if you're constantly focused on
work and in that stressed survival State
you're not going to open up your mind
for Creative problem solving or any of
the spiritual things in life that make
life good and enjoyable and living in
the present moment if you're constantly
focused on work by definition you are
not present so if you have to work more
than four hours or else your business
will explode and fall to the ground then
that's a problem fix it with systems and
commandment number 10 is to make your
process more efficient so if you have a
problem whether while you're working or
if you're working over four hours then
those problems should try to be solved
with creativity and systemization this
is another other important thing why
it's so so so so important to not focus
on work when you're not working because
then you open your mind to the ability
of creative problem solving that's when
your subconscious mind sends the Insight
or idea to your conscious mind and you
have that aha moment it's like in the
shower when you're having a shower
thoughts and you have the best idea in
the world it's because you're not
focused on work so let's take for
example when I had a lot of client work
and I couldn't my my work was spilling
over four hours in that case I had to
build a larger audience so I have more
traffic create a product that doesn't
require my time promote and improve that
product until it's sustainable and take
on less clients with my new free time
and you would be correct in assuming
that this isn't instant nothing that I
talk about is instant life isn't instant
you have to be patient with this and you
you have to be on this path for life so
a bonus number 11 is to leverage digital
tools we live in a world where we're so
blessed we're Extremely Blessed because
once you have the the money to invest in
automation software or just of software
that will make your business a lot
easier I highly recommend doing so it's
like instead of sending manual DMS in
order to reach out to people you can
build an audience fuel your email list
and then buy a software that allows you
to create email sequences that mimics
what sales Outreach would look like in
the DMS and then you can focus so much
more of your attention on building
actual leverage through content and then
feeling that newsletter and email
sequence to the point where you don't
have to send in DMS to get clients or
make sales and then when it comes to
systemizing scheduling content you can
use something like tweet Hunter which I
use to schedule my tweets and then those
get turned into other content so that's
a way of scheduling and me just being
able to go into my phone type in a tweet
and schedule it immediately and then
forget about it I don't have to go back
and post or even get on Twitter and one
thing I do highly recommend is to write
all of this out in notion if you aren't
using notion you should just start now
because it's going to take a long time
to learn or just get used to the
structure of it and you're gonna have to
go back and refine things here and there
but just create a new page right create
a new page and write down what you're
going to do tomorrow for those four
hours of work that is going to be your
first system right steps and then the
next day come back refine it what didn't
work what do I have to do differently
today do that for a week and then note
common patterns and you can turn it into
a weekly system and then abide by that
and refine it with time so my challenge
for you to end this video is to actually
apply this information you may be
watching this YouTube video to learn
something or just for entertainment or
whatever it may be but four hour work
days are more than possible I've proven
that and there's many people that
Leverage The Power of the internet to do
that and you'll be you'll only be able
to discover whether you can or not
through direct experience it doesn't
matter what you think is possible about
for our workday or not you if you think
it's impossible you don't have the
awareness or experience that allows you
to believe that it's possible and make
it a reality for yourself so that's the
main thing go back through this you can
find the actual written version of this
video in the description under the
co-letter you can take note of all 10 of
these Commandments you can write them
down in notion with your systems and
just start tinkering what are you going
to do for the next day week whatever it
may be gain Clarity on it and start
acting all right that is the end thank
