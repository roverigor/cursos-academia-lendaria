here's how you get ahead of 99 of people
in 6 to 12 months become brutally aware
of two things the first is what you
don't want the second is where you will
end up if you keep doing the same things
in life observe the masses and see where
mindless action leads it's not pretty At
All by any means when you do this when
you observe the masses sit with your
thoughts think them through don't just
close your mind off and take what you
see on the surface and accept it as
reality that's not how this works that
closed-minded surface level living is
what got you into this situation in the
first place you need to think deeper
it's easier to know what you don't want
from experience and observation than it
is to know what you want from
imagination and just thinking and having
all of these Grand ideas for your future
and don't get me wrong here I'm not
writing those things off those things
are good they are not bad do not label
any of what I'm saying as good or bad
test it through your direct experience
many of you know that I'm very big on
creating a vision for your future but
the best way to do that is by also
creating an anti-vision having a
negative thing something that you
despise something that will get you
angry because negative energy is very
very potent it can be used and
transmuted to actually achieve what you
want in life it's like when you're going
to the gym I'll be walking on the
treadmill as a warm-up and I'll just
think of what my life would be without
the gym where could I end up if I don't
put my all into that workout and
somehow I just get very very pissed and
I can feel that energy I'm not being
pissed isn't bad negative emotions
aren't bad they exist they are what they
are and they should be used not
suppressed but used for good so to
create your anti-vision sit down with a
notebook become a mad scientist draw out
everything sit with a notebook for 30
minutes and just draw out everything
your entire future but start with the
anti-vision write down every single
thing that you do not want in this life
what do you not want to look like what
do you not want your future to be what
do you not want your day to look like on
an everyday basis and from that it will
be much clearer to you what your vision
will actually be because it's just the
opposite of those things and so when you
look at your anti-vision after creating
it or as you're writing it you should
feel uncomfortable you should feel very
uncomfortable with the possibility of
where you could end up in life if you do
not take control of your life and so
with that discomfort you should laser in
on one big goal laser in on your vision
for the future and this should be
meaningful because your anti-vision is
usually meaningless it comes from
mindless action it comes from not doing
anything and letting entropy take hold
and just drag your life into chaos
that's what entropy does that is the
supreme law of the universe if you do
not create order for your life you will
decline into chaos so in that same
notebook with that vision for your
future and your anti-vision plan out be
the mad scientist that is going to work
on the project of your life create a
plan create a strategy for exactly what
you're going to do on a day-to-day basis
week by week every single thing you're
going to do for the next week and write
it out get extremely specific create the
order so you do not be a victim of
entropy next disappear and whenever I
say they disappear like disappear for
six months people take it literally
almost every much of what I say is
metaphorical and exaggerated to get the
essence of the message across I'm not
saying disappear like your physical body
is just going to disappear I'm saying
disappear from the things that don't
belong in your life cut them out this
can be people games apps or even bad
habits just become aware of the things
that are holding you back and there are
multiple ways to do this but with the
process that we've discussed and what's
worked best for me is to just rip the
Band-Aid off get rid of them all you
don't need to explain yourself here to
other people that are going to be
messing you hey bro where'd you go just
disappear in other words break your
addiction with feeling like because
that feeling feeling like has one
cause and that is well it has multiple
causes but we're talking about mental
here not physical which would be
attributed to something like nutrition
or food but mental mental energy that
you are expending on people and things
things that don't give a about you
and direct that mental energy that you
now have into your vision for the future
because you have created a system that
will prevent entropy in your life the
thing that will take you from
anti-vision to Vision the system there
and to maintain a system to prevent
entropy you need energy in this case
mental energy to actualize or manifest
that Vision if you want to call it that
last make a habit of the boring
fundamentals But realize that the boring
fundamentals are not boring because most
successful people they take the same
repetitive actions on a day-to-day basis
in a game in like a game that mimics the
real world you are logging on and you
are repeating the same thing over and
over to slowly level up over time right
your your killing monsters you're going
through dungeons you're doing the same
thing to stack experience so you need to
transfer that into the real world and
move the levers that will actually take
you towards your goals these are
fundamentals these are principles these
aren't tactics and so understand that
these are not boring they seem boring on
the surface when you look at someone
else doing it day in day out like oh
this guy Dan he writes for 30 minutes
every morning oh that's that seems so
boring but it's Mastery over misery it's
like how Sushi chefs they take years to
perfect the preparation of rice and it
comes in stages like a tennis player you
first learn how to hold the Racket and
there is a very specific way to do that
well and then you move up to the next
stage which is how do you angle the
racket how do you hit the ball and you
have to practice these things over and
over and over again like how you were
learning to walk until it becomes
effortless or unconscious so you open up
more mental energy to move on to the
next thing that will take you ahead of
the people that are trying to just get a
result that would usually take 10 years
to get in two weeks that's just not
going going to happen and so the
question that everyone asks like when
you start something new is okay when
will I see this result like a tennis
player when will I be able to compete
and stop asking that question because
you're going to get an answer that you
don't want to hear and it's going to
throw you off track it takes years it
takes an entire lifetime of trial and
error to create a project as I said
become a mad scientist the essence of
science is trial and error so to perfect
a project your life that you are
building out it is going to take a
lifetime
get comfortable with that thought so
this entire process that we just went
over of realizing what you don't want
creating a strategy and launching
yourself into the opposite direction and
prioritizing long-term success in
Mastery is the origin story you will
hear this in every origin story of a
successful person so flip the switch
