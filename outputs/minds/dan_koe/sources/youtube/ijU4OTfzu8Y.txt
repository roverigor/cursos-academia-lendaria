money is a problem everyone knows it and
nobody can escape the desire to chase
after the next get rich quick scheme or
the latest coin or just the promise
for a better life fast right because
that's what humans want when dopamine
kicks into play when you're in
imagination land and you imagine a
better life for yourself and you're like
oh I really want that nice mansion I
want those fancy cars and dopamine is
reinforcing that and it's like I want it
right now I need to get that and so
something that can promise that and has
the illusion of proof or even actual
true proof in that case is just
positioned in a wrong way or a
misleading way of how fast you're going
to actually see the results then that
creates the problem and we get stuck in
this Loop of trying to get things fast
not getting them closing our mind off to
the potential opportunity that is
actually there and pursuing that over
the long term with consistency but
we're here to talk about money we're
here to talk about the thing that
impacts the entirety of Our Lives it
impacts the food that we can eat it
impacts the places that we can live
therefore with that it affects the
people that we can connect with that
bring more opportunity and it also
impacts how we view the world because
all of us are tied to money in a sense
and it it determines the stress that we
face on face on a day-to-day basis if
you do not know how to regulate or
handle that stress with something like
mindfulness and all of those things that
we talked about so the place that you
live the food you can eat those all loot
back and start affecting your ability to
make more money again why because the
food that you eat impacts the energy
that you have in order to go out and
make money per se or even the
neurotransmitters that are floating
around in your head about how you feel
and then your relationship with money
and how you view it how you perceive it
and all of that other stuff that we we
need to break this down so the first
thing is that 99 of people aren't aware
of what's possible and I'm not saying
this in a way to put you down I'm just
saying it as a fact because I was in the
same place most people are living in a
state of close-mindedness right
opportunities don't register to them
right they don't if you have no way of
making money and then you see someone
doing a car wash on the side of the road
and your first reaction is like huh what
a loser this guy's on like doing a card
car wash on the side of the road when
you're there worrying about your next
paycheck and he's probably pulling in
more money than you could ever imagine
and you have no idea you don't question
you aren't curious about the depth
behind that you just see someone
standing on the side of the road
advertising a car wash or whatever it
may be someone on social media
advertising a service that you don't
think is profitable and so you don't
dive into it more and do all that stuff
you aren't conscious and so it hurts to
realize this it hurts to realize that
you are the cause of your own suffering
and what I'm mean by that is that your
thoughts shape your reality your
thoughts shape your reality AKA
how you perceive something your your
beliefs and your world view and the the
mental the state of mind that you've
adopted over time through conditioning
and just learning and acting in the real
world it influences how you perceive the
world and that influences your the the
automatic thoughts and robotic
mechanical nature of
like how you perceive the world when you
see something
does it do you pause and do you actually
dive deeper or are you just like oh
that's a sidewalk oh that's a road oh
that's a guy holding a sign for a car
wash oh that I'm about to get in a crash
and you know all this stuff it's all
survival based but your beliefs or your
worldview dictates your perception of
that reality your thoughts reinforce
that reality and your perception
determines how you act in the world
right if you don't see quite literally
see or perceive an opportunity as
something that will and can make money
then it's closed off to you because you
don't dive down that pathway right that
is only the start it is the iceberg of
all of the other actions you will take
just by taking that one action and this
is why it is so important to
continuously push outside of your
comfort zone because that is an unknown
territory that is something that you do
not see after that first step or after
seeing the tip of the iceberg acting on
it and opening up let's say a pathway
into the unknown so you can start that
Journey
and it's just very rewarding but let's
talk about the notion of stress in our
society because I feel like that is a
huge
preventer for many people to make money
and so what causes stress Focus you can
watch the last video two videos ago
um it's called why you feel overwhelmed
all the time and eight steps to overcome
that something about reclaiming your
focus but you have to understand that
attention is placed where your attention
is placed
is your reality right your thoughts
create your reality whatever but your
attention what
fills the contents of your Consciousness
or what you focus on or what your
attention is immersed in is your reality
now if you're focused on a negative
thought or you're again thought shape
reality so if you wake up and you
immediately think oh I have to get
this done that stress response right
you're hyper focused on that thing that
fills your awareness or your content of
Consciousness and you feel negative
because of that and then you may
misinterpret that negative feeling as
truly negative or something that isn't
supposed to be there because of
expectations beliefs assumptions again
reflecting back on how you perceive
things and the illusion that is
perception and you have to take that
into account right you have to be able
to pause step back and actually think
right you have to critically think
rather than mindlessly think and just
let things consume your attention
without your control right because
that's the problem here it's survival
sort of Revival and basic needs and not
having an understanding of those things
right because the self your identity is
what you were trying to survive right
think of it we started off as a blank
slate as a human our minds were blank
slates to an extent they had like prior
programming and genetics and networks
that were already there but we picked up
most of what we know just by going about
life from our parents from schools from
what the government said culture Society
all of these other things have
constructed our mind in this way to
survive in this modern world right and
so now think of it every single aspect
of your identity I want you to think of
your the self or your identity as
something you've constructed right
because my name wasn't Dan until it was
assigned to me uh I wasn't a white boy
until I was told so and I believed that
right now again I am a white boy and
that's how this is a weird way of saying
it but uh like that's how
people understand me and I understand
them and that is survival but then it
gets a bit more complex right because
that's generally well accepted but
things like religious Doctrine ideology
just beliefs the arguments of the world
are people trying to survive a certain
aspect of their identity because they
believe it to be true again beliefs
dictate perception dictate how you act
in the world so with that said I want
you to think of the self this is kind of
just like a concept that I've been
thinking of yourself think of it as
something that you have it's like a
bunch of dots right think of your body
as like floating dots and each of those
dots
are connected to something that it is in
a relationship with so if you identify
or you are in a relationship with a
specific religious teaching like
Christianity and they say making money
is bad and then you're hearing me
telling you that making money is good or
that you can make more money that string
is kind of plucked or it's threatened
right and so you get a stress response
you get angry you start defending your
own perspective or your own beliefs on
that and then you close your mind off to
actually making that money so this is
just something that you really need to
become aware of are your reactions
people put it a lot simpler than this
when they talk about things like
um
like being mindful or pausing before
reacting or like all of these other
things where you just pause and you
actually think things through rather
than be a mechanical robot that just
walks about life mindlessly and so what
happens when these little strings of
yourself are plucked is it gives you a
stress response okay and again Focus or
where your focus is placed causes stress
so if that string is plucked or your
belief is challenged on let's say money
then
your attention goes there do you see
where I'm going with this if you don't
re like restart the video because your
attention what fills your attention and
that instant negativity that you aren't
in control of you aren't in control of
it and how your attention gets sucked
there and then you have a stress
response and then that stress response
Narrows your focus and fills your
attention with only that negative thing
negativity bias in Psychology and
you closed your mind off you that's what
narrowing your focus is is you're
closing your mind to certain things
rather than opening your mind and
actually seeing everything for what it
is accurate perception therefore
dictating your actions revolving around
that and shifting that from trying to
survive that when nothing's been
threatened like you just go about your
life you walk away you close the app you
turn on you get out of Twitter it's not
real and unless it's a real threat like
you being stabbed of course yes you're
going to go instinctual and you're not
going to be able to control yourself and
you're going to go and you're gonna try
to defend yourself against other guy
because that's true survival right but
survival of the self of beliefs are
really they're not doing anything to you
you're having a stress response
narrowing your focus filling your
attention with something negative around
that and it's reinforcing a negative
relationship with money in this case
which then prevents you from acting in
order to make more money so I want you
to think here when I'm talking about
money have you had any negative
reactions as you were living watching
this video and now I'm not saying that
those are wrong or those aren't backed
I'm not some form of omnipotent person
I'm presenting an argument here but I
want you to be able to see the argument
from my perspective rather than closing
your mind and maintaining your narrow
perspective on what could be a bad
relationship with money so you need to
stop and you need to think okay what
happens when I have to talk about money
where does my attention go right you're
paying attention to the thought
processes here because thoughts create
reality so with money
if I talk about money with you right if
we're one-on-one you're talking with a
friend about money and maybe a big
purchase that has to be made or you need
to like you want to go out but you don't
have enough money to do so how does that
make you feel right and where does your
attention go next does it go to like oh
no I have to wait till Friday until I
can do that and then you start to get
locked into this Paradigm of like
oh
the paycheck comes Friday so I need to
base my entire life around that Friday
paycheck rather than start to create my
own income source and realize that not
everyone gets paid on a Friday and that
I can get paid whenever I want if I
understand how to get paid what like
when I want with a business so do you
get mad when people talk about money do
you get uncomfortable do you get
stressed or are you happy do you have a
good relationship with it are you making
more than enough to take care of your
survival needs and decrease the stress
that money causes which I would believe
that eighty percent of people's stress
can be sold by money because then
there's all I'm kind of rambling here
but then there's the other argument of
like oh money money isn't everything
money doesn't cause happiness and it's
like you're right but it's the like the
other way around is right too uh you can
make as much money as you want and you
have to understand that there's also the
argument of Oh Our Ancestors did this
our ancestors did that and they are also
right but then what is also right is
that our monies our ancestors entire
lives were not built around money they
didn't spend three thousand dollars a
month to sustain their living right we
live in a completely different
environment and we have to adapt we have
to integrate ancient modern and all of
these other teachings into it let the
truth Blur by not subscribing to one of
those perspectives and take those and
act by our own doing in order to become
directly conscious and directly
experience life as it is now this is all
fun to talk about right abstractions and
all of this philosophical stuff on
survival and all these other things that
are truly important they are extremely
important because the base of everything
is focus the base of everything is
perception and perspective and your
world view and deconstructing that over
these videos or just in general in your
life is going to spread into every
single thing that you ever want to
accomplish ever in your life that's just
what it is you have to fix the root
before you can try and fix another
problem so as with all videos I want to
give you a few lessons and in this case
seven hopefully practical lessons that
should make you more than a college
degree because clickbait titles work I
don't think I'll call it that but the
first lesson being or the first step
being you need to step into the arena
Step One is the man in the arena why
because making money is a skill it's
something that you can practice it is
something that you can get better at
like that's just what business is you
get better at the skill of business
which is making money but you have to
understand what business is it's not
like a sport where you can go to the
park with your friend and practice like
your throw or even running or even like
a tackle or something like that with
business you have to understand that it
comes from building and selling you have
to build something of value and you need
to sell that to another person implying
that you need to be in the arena with
someone that has money to give if you
are not in the arena with someone that
has money to give if you're overhearing
tutorial Health just practicing
practicing practicing like this like
your skills itself that are supposed to
make money rather than making money as a
skill by actively doing it in the real
world and building projects that you can
try and practice selling to someone else
then you're not going to make money like
if you don't do that you're not going to
make money if you literally have no
ability to make money
because another person isn't on the
receiving end of what you're doing then
you're not going to make money so step
or lesson number two is open mindedness
we've talked about this a lot but if you
are not open to the potential of being
being rich then you will never get rich
that's just how life Works in general
you have to have the idea and then you
have to actualize it you have to have
the belief some people can stumble
across this right you can stumble across
riches or whatever it else may be but
that's extremely rare right we want to
be in control of it okay so in order to
be in control of this stuff the thought
the belief the reality of being rich or
having this amount of money needs to be
a thing so you open your mind by paying
attention to where your attention goes
funny but where your attention goes
when you have that negative feeling this
is mindfulness as a whole and why I'm a
big proponent on kind of spiritual or
conscious entrepreneurship is because
you can't just like
do things and hope that they work you
have to be conscious of all of these
things and you have to consistently get
uncomfortable and expand your mind by
learning self-education being open to
Opportunities not labeling or judging
specific business models or things that
you just think aren't for you you have
to pull the truth from everything you
have to see all perspectives learn and
pull the truth and actions from the
middle of all of that in order to make
progress the fastest that is the only
shortcut that you're going to find is
consciousness number three is the
fundamentals are king So as always I
make a cool little graphic that are
usually I would say they're mostly for
Instagram but you can see it here and it
pretty much shows you that you need two
things in business you need one value
you need a product or service that
promises a desirable result that people
actually want value right and offer a
product or service product or service
product or service don't rely on let's
say a social media platform like YouTube
and growing on YouTube and having the
ads or ad views pay you your income be
in direct control of it by creating
something of your own like I've created
a bunch of courses I've created a cohort
I've done Consulting I've done
freelancing I've tried e-commerce Brands
I've failed that even more than all of
those right now I'm thinking about
building a software and again this is
where you need to open your mind back to
step two is that
I never thought that building a software
like a SAS or like an app was something
for me right or something that I could
do and until I opened my mind to that
and started researching it and looking
into it and actually having the
intention of building something then you
realize that's possible right and if
there are roadblocks like oh I don't
have enough capital I don't have enough
something else you may have to set it
aside for later but that doesn't mean
you can't do it anyone can do it right
you can learn to code if you want to if
you don't have the capital it's like
okay spend six months learning to code
build the app and then start to sell it
right you can do whatever the you
want and so back to an analogy I love
with the whole business needing one
value people money happens in the middle
is a fundamental
than a universal principle right in
terms of a relationship with someone
else so it's like with dating if you
aren't Landing dates one either you
aren't valuable enough and you're in an
environment where there are a lot of
people or you are valuable enough but
you aren't in an environment with a lot
of people and so if those don't match
how are you going to land a date so
lesson or step number four is the one
person business model which I believe is
the best starting point and possibly
ending point for 95 percent of people
because I truly believe that everyone is
an entrepreneur you're already
developing some form of value in your
life you just may not be sharing it with
someone else in exchange for what it's
worth which is money sometimes you're
exchanging it for something else like
love or feeling better about yourself or
something else rather than money it's
just an exchange of value and what value
you want to receive through the value
that you give right is it money is it
love and affection is it it a
relationship what is the conversion that
you were trying to secure it's just
different perspectives all revolving
around the same thing which is creating
value which is the only thing that
humans do you have an idea which is
intangible you make it tangible and
that's where buildings language
philosophy science everything comes from
that's what humans have built so you
have to build something whatever it may
be and exchange it for Value if some of
that value is money then you're an
entrepreneur and so what used to take a
few thousand dollars a huge team of
people a bunch of programmers to build
something or at least be an entrepreneur
you can do it as one person now there's
no code tool there's website Builders
there's endless at free education online
you can buy people's aggregated systems
as courses to accelerate that process
you can buy coaching you can build
anything you want you can attract a
massive audience through social media if
you understand how to play that game and
then you have people and then when you
create something about you like a course
physical product Tool uh cohort
Consulting freelancing whatever the
it may be a software then you sell it to
those people because those things are
aligned and so in next week's video
believe it's next week's uh one of the
coming videos we're going to talk about
the one person business more and kind of
the entrepreneurial method so how to
find a problem-solved problem do all
these things that lead to making more
money but for now understand and just be
aware and open-minded enough to know
that you can do something with almost
zero dollars to your name and as one
person so lesson or step number five is
think big act small and so I want to
read you a previous tweet of mine is
when you're lost try everything and see
what sticks when you're overwhelmed drop
everything and see what sticks so again
it's all like Duality it's all back and
forth it's all on and off that's what
reality is but you understand you have
to understand that creativity comes from
thinking big AKA open-mindedness having
a grand idea or vision for your future
and then taking that because that's what
creativity is you have to be open-minded
enough and big picture thinking and
zoomed out and not hyper focused and
stressed enough to be creative and then
acting small so creativity is about
connection so thinking big holding a
bunch in your mind and connecting the
dots and then productivity is about
Clarity so connection creativity Clarity
uh productivity when you are hyper clear
and you're focused or you pull from your
vision of the future it's aligned with
your goals you know exactly the first
step to take and you start taking that
and the skill matches the challenge then
you are productive you are in Flow State
and you are creating the reality that
you want to live in so that's the main
thing because you can get stuck in Big
Picture thinking mode or like big
thinking mode and get overwhelmed
because there's too many options it has
to be a balance it has to be big picture
small action big picture small action
creativity productivity and those can be
worked into your days your weeks your
months whatever it may be so lesson
number six is to increase your Baseline
income and decrease your base line
lifestyle needs because I hit I'm not
saying this to brag I try not to come
off as bragging uh
I hope it to be inspiring right because
I hit my first 100 000 month uh last
week and the thing with that is is I'm
probably not going to hit that again
for maybe a few more months right until
it becomes my new Baseline but in order
for it to become my new Baseline I have
to hit like a high of 150 000 right
because like equilibrium it'll start to
balance out and then you hit a new high
and it does all that stuff but I'm not
going to hit that right and so in
business a lot of things are
unpredictable and you can make it more
predictable by having like a membership
or recurring monthly income or something
of that case but overall it's pretty
 unpredictable it's not a steady
paycheck every single week and you have
to be okay with that right because
you're going to hit a high month and
then you're going to be like me and be
like oh I want a new car and so I bought
a new car and
that like now my Baseline lifestyle has
increased right I'm well above that
Baseline so I did it in a smart way and
I love the car but at the same time it's
like my Baseline lifestyle needs have
increased and that is kind of tactical
stress to maintain a high Baseline
income right and now I'm at a point
where I'm happy with this but there's
going to come a time where I either drop
two loan monthly income because I don't
want to sustain a certain amount or I
have to decrease my lifestyle so I have
to move into a cheaper place or I have
to get rid of my car or I have to do
something else if I don't want as we
talked about earlier just a certain
amount of stress in my life right that's
where the stress is created is the gap
between those two and how small that Gap
is so that alone is stress regulation is
the gap between how much you're making
and how much you're spending all right
and lesson or step number seven is
leverage your time and then your mind
which is kind of a spin-off of naval's
tweet which is earn with your mind not
with your time because manual labor
implies that there is a cap there is a
limit you can only work so many hours of
the day you can only give so much of
your time it's finite right that means
your income is finite it's not infinite
so what you have to do to start is you
need to get results you need to get a
baseline income and just get into the
arena with manual labor like consulting
freelancing or something of that nature
to kind of establish a name and results
for yourself but then you need to earn
with your mind it has to demand
creativity you have to be building
leverage whether it be a social media
audience email list or other form of
Leverage that allows you to send people
to a product right a product that can be
that has high profit margins and can be
replicated very quickly so a digital
product for that case or even a SAS or a
software are good routes to go
for cash flow at least because then
you send people to them with your mind
in a sense because you're attracting
people with the thoughts in your head
via content to that product they buy it
and you spend no time at all selling
that thing but freelancing and other
things are a bit different so you need
to as you increase your leverage with
manual labor then you have to
decrease the amount of time you spend
because you have more leverage and
create higher leverage products right so
leverage in terms of being able to get
back your time and then leverage in
terms of like
