what's up welcome back to another video
i'm glad to have you here we are going
to talk about how i brainwashed myself
into being
confident because nobody's
confident like it
i don't i don't know how to say this man
without sounding mean uh but your
average person
there's a oh what i'll say is this
there's a reason why these videos about
confidence my my me
mine may not have that many views but
there are
a ton of videos out there on confidence
that just have so many views it's a very
hot topic because nobody's
confident everyone's stuck inside and
not really doing any things with their
lives because of this problem because
whether they know it or not whether they
are aware of it or not or register
it as this or not they are fearful of
what will come
if they were just confident enough to go
and dive into the unknown aspects of
life so that's the problem here right
you
need to have confidence if you want to
make progress in this world and become
the person that you want to become and
achieve the things that you want to
achieve and if you don't have the
confidence you will not take the
necessary risk to get there that risk
and overthinking of that risk is what is
holding you back from actually
doing these big things in your life
and the other thing here is familiarity
right we don't want to take risks or
dive into the unknown because it is
unfamiliar to us
so what needs to happen here is you need
to make the unknown known you need to
make the unfamiliar familiar you need to
make the abnormal normal because when
you first start a business let's say
you're a freelancer right low risk low
barrier of entry business model you
start a freelancing business you try to
you work for free
and you get
trapped in this familiar mindset of my
work is low value i'm charging free
maybe i charge like 500 per client but
until you take that larger risk and
charge five thousand dollars per client
because you are unaware that five
thousand dollars is not a lot of money
two big businesses
that will never become normal to you and
you will not gain that level of
confidence right that this comes in
levels confidence comes in levels
because you may be confident enough to
charge five thousand dollars for your
service because you understand that
other business owners think that that's
good but then when it comes to charging
10 20 000 even 50 000 for your service
it's still unknown it's still unfamiliar
you aren't confident in doing that
because
busting through
these levels of confidence is not a
thing for you that's not normal you
aren't confident in boosting your own
confidence and that's the other thing
uh and
really where this problem stems and
we'll dive into this in a bit but it's
the same thing with approaching people
approaching women meeting
just new people in general or talking to
high status individuals because
you don't see them as a person you don't
see them as a human being you don't see
them as what this is think spirituality
terms you just don't see them as a being
you see them as a concept that you have
formed in your head which has made it
unfamiliar to you and that is a problem
of perspective right and it's the same
thing with all this you aren't attacking
your goals full force because you don't
have clarity on what that unknown
actually holds and you will never gain
that clarity you will never shine that
light of awareness onto that unknown
dark area of the map
without leaning into it so the result of
becoming confident leads to more
opportunities right and i'll paint a
picture of this because as we just
discussed you gain more opportunities by
making the unfamiliar familiar by diving
into the unknown by getting
uncomfortable and make and marinating
yourself in that uncomfortableness and
making it comfortable to you right so
i have been writing a book that was one
of my first steps into the unknown
because i was always of the mind i was
in my mind thinking
oh i could never write a book
uh
i i just who how do you write a book
right all of these questions and things
that are holding me back from actually
just starting and doing it and finally i
decided to just start doing it and what
do you know the book started flowing i
had a project to work on so everyday
life i could connect things back to it
things stuck out to me more it opened up
more opportunities because i shine that
light of awareness on the map and that
gave me
other things to become aware of right
this is one big
thing that is very important to diving
into the
unknown is
that
you you are unaware of all of these
surrounding areas of that one location
me writing the book made me aware of so
many other things it helped me learn
they helped me learn exactly the the
value that i was trying to display in
the book but that's aside from the point
so i gained that level of confidence
started working on that and then i want
to make this a best seller right so i
reached out to people that would help me
do that i got on a call with them these
are pretty big league people they're
very experienced in the book publishing
space and
they started talking about like million
dollar brand deals and tedx talks and
like book launch tours and i'm like holy
 was i thinking too small and now my
awareness is spread even more it's even
larger it's it's
more opportunity is open opening up
simply because i took that small step of
writing the very first word of my book
do you understand what i'm talking about
here like it's a very small step to get
there now there's
let's talk about actually becoming
confident you understand how by diving
into the unknown and just making the
unfamiliar familiar to you
but
there's a common misconception everyone
tells you
competence equals confidence
and that makes sense it makes sense yes
increase your skill level increase the
knowledge you have uh increase
whatever pertaining to whatever you want
to become confident in and
you'll become confident but that that's
only a part of the answer there's two
parts to confidence there's competence
actually being able to like matching
your skill level with the level of
confidence that you're trying to achieve
and then there is a perception or
perspective issue
where
you need to understand the balance of
thinking and doing right overthinking
and analysis by paralysis so many
people up and they never pursue their
goals or do anything great because
they're too trapped in their heads when
they're heads is just concepts it's it's
problems that are not real because
you're projecting
into a place where you have zero
awareness about so how do we overcome
this problem of
thinking well the the first thing is
just to become aware of the distractions
that you are faced with every single day
the the things that are distracting you
from
actually pursuing your goals and
doing the things that you know you're
supposed to be doing avoiding modern
distractions like uh shitty social media
accounts uh netflix video games you know
all the stuff that the self-help people
tell you to avoid i
i'm not going to tell you to avoid them
entirely they they have a place it's
intuitive uh the masculine feminine
whatever wu way of the world
the energy of the world
all of that stuff you don't need to
eliminate them entirely unless you truly
have a problem with it and you need to
be honest with yourself about that and
that is
a growth process within itself but in
terms of actually thinking you need to
understand that you were confident as a
child your confidence
was at its highest when you were a child
you did not give a you weren't
scared of anything you would go and like
jump into a ditch with a bunch of rocks
in it get her cry for a bit and you'd be
fine but
that's the thing all of these positive
traits confidence
i don't know whatever happiness
everything positive right
is a byproduct of nature it is intuitive
and it was suppressed and kind of
clouded over let's say this is your
natural state right this is your natural
state of being when you are not thinking
when you are not projecting into some
direction of psychological time into the
predictable future
of like stress and anxiety and certain
uncertainty or the familiar past of
previous stresses and feelings that you
are aware of right you're you're just
pulling those into the present and
feeling them now
but you've gone through them before and
you need to make that disconnect so
there's you here you're confident as a
child and then the cultural conditioning
process took place where
you
go through the school system you learn
you
meet new friends there are
beliefs opinions biases
even religious doctrine and all of this
other stuff that is
placed on you and your spontaneity and
all of these other things are
discouraged because
adults that are living in either way of
psychological time are
projecting those fears and insecurities
on you and they become your fears and
insecurities until you become aware of
those and realize hey those aren't mine
so that's the thing the automatic
reaction and
and
reaction
making you act in a specific way
according according to the goals that
you want to reach and not diving into
the unknown because you're afraid of
whatever uncertainty
lies out there
that's where this comes into place to to
kind of remove those fears from your
life and and the first thing
that
you need to do here is become aware
right you when that
thought or emotion or feeling
is at the point where it's like okay i'm
either going to feel this through and do
nothing or
something needs to change so this is my
brainwashing system that i developed and
use on myself consistently to remain
confident in whatever i'm doing and take
action and kind of dissolve these
limiting beliefs that are in my head i
call this the conscious conditioning
practice be not it's opposing the
cultural conditioning process so this is
external stimuli and beliefs judgments
biases everything else that is projected
on you
and then conscious conditioning is
i am choosing
the what my beliefs are in creating my
own reality
so then i can operate within that
reality with confidence because let me
paint a picture here i'll throw a
graphic up on the screen but here's your
perception here's reality and then
covering that blurring that blurring
your lens of perception
is the
biases beliefs judgments of other people
and the insecurities that are projected
on you so since these are in your head
and they may be ingrained
deeply to an extent and causing
reactions within you
the first thing you need to do when
these happen is pause instead of react
you're aware that you need to do this
now and it takes practice this isn't
going to happen overnight because it
took 10 years of cultural conditioning
to get you here so
that's the thing when one of these
thoughts pops into your head you pause
the next thing you anchor your attention
right i'm writing this in my book the
art of focus focus is a way of
channeling your attention or framing
your attention and an anchor
is
bringing your focus to somewhere
positive
so your natural energy can follow that
okay so an anchor is let's say the
breath if you're focused on your breath
like in mindfulness practices
you are bringing your attention to the
present moment in the present moment
where psychological time doesn't exist
there is only positivity that is where
confidence and everything else exists so
that alone will raise your baseline
energy to a higher level there's other
anchors like nature there's music
there's journaling to get the thoughts
out of your head
there is different environments like
when you go
i'm sure you visited a place at some
point in your life where it just feels
good to be there right the energy is
high whether you believe in
vibes or good vibes or not it's quantum
physics people just like the hippies
say like oh high vibes only it's quantum
physics everything vibrates everything
has energy and this is like proven
science as hippie dippy as some people
make it seem so you paused you anchored
your attention so you are not reacting
to this
thought and making it emotion you are
still feeling okay you're calm you're
collected the next thing is to objectify
that thought objectify it and understand
that it is a separate entity it is not
you it is a separate entity that should
have zero effect on you and you need to
understand where that came from so the
next step after pause anchor objectify
is to question and this happens in the
form of metacognition or thinking about
your thinking which is awareness in
general you're aware of your thinking
you're thinking about it and you're
questioning it and you let questions
trigger questions why am i feeling this
way why am i thinking this way what is
this thought what sparked this thought
am i going to let this thought affect me
even though i'm
fully aware that it is an entity
and all of these other things and
journaling really helps with this quite
literally journaling journaling through
the problem writing it down writing down
questions answering the questions right
there and i guarantee
you'll feel amazing and pretty
damn confident after that but the next
step after pause anchor objectify
question is to reframe so if you
have if that thought in your head is
fearful
so let's say i'm afraid of approaching a
girl right
or some thought pops into my head oh
she'll she'll never want to get with me
and this goes for all things in life i
know a lot of people just struggle with
women so this is a
one of the topics but
that's the thing you i would pause
anchor bring my attention to the present
moment or some other uh
potential reality or something else
where positive energy exists and i'd
feel better
and then i would objectify
that thought and realize that that is
not me that is a thought
and it should not dictate my actions i
dictate my actions
and
then you question it is this rational
blah blah blah no it's not rational
because i don't even know who this
person is i've never met them in my life
i don't know what they're thinking i'm
i'm just insecure and i need to get over
this and so the next thing is reframing
because that's a fear
right so a massive fear can be
reframed
into interest
and in in this case i'm originally i was
fearful and like oh assuming all these
things informing concepts of who this
actual person is when i could be curious
or interested in learning about that
person and this works for more than just
women this works for
this is like a communication or
networking hack in general is you become
interested in what that person actually
does rather than assuming
something that would make you feel
fearful of approaching that person
you become interested in figuring out
what it is that makes them them right
and and
that alone will lead to other things and
people love when you
are genuinely interested in learning
about them and they'll talk all day you
let them keep the conversation going you
just ask questions
and they'll think you're the most
interesting person in the world i think
there was a
there's some story that i heard on this
where there was a guy on an airplane and
he just asked
questions the whole time or let the
other person talk the entire time and
when they took a survey when they got
off the plane
it's like how did you enjoy your flight
and the guy
that was doing all the talking was like
oh man i sat by the the most interesting
person in the world
it was such a great conversation and
then
they asked like well what was the guy's
name he's like oh
i don't know i never really asked his
name and so the the guy that was talking
the entire time thought the other guy
was super interesting just because he
was asking questions because he was
interested and curious in that other
person so
tangent there but you get what i'm
saying here and then the next thing is
to act and i'm a big fan of simplified
inspired action so
when it comes time to act on whatever
you are doing you your consumption
should match that the things you are
learning and consuming on a daily basis
whether it be podcasts books social
media content should match the thing
that you are going so you are inspired
to do that there's more energy there and
inspiration and now in terms of
simplified action
just just taking this most stupidly
simple
uh action you can take broken down into
its its simplest step so for me writing
the book
write the first sentence or
outline the first chapter write the
title write the subtitle and all this is
subject to change but just getting
started
it
starts the snowball of momentum and
i can dive into the psychology behind
this but i believe you can intuit
how
effective and important that first step
towards building that snowball of
momentum
is so
with that
that is my brainwashing process it is
pause anchor objectify question reframe
and act and
all of that
combined this entire video
should be the only thing you need to
become confident in all areas of life or
at least start becoming
confident in all areas of life you have
to think of confidence
on
a spectrum or
in levels it's not like oh i just need
to do this one thing and i'm going to
become the most confident person in
every single area of my life no there's
a lot of in your head
from cultural conditioning that you need
to overcome to revert back to that
childlike state of con confidence that
natural state of confidence not
necessarily childlike but the confidence
that you have with it within you that
was
covered over by all of this cultural
conditioning and things that were
projected on you and that you did not
have the tools
equipped to actually deal with that so
now you have the tools you can start
consciously conditioning
your brain to
become more confident so with that i
hope you enjoyed uh check out the
