ever since I can remember I've been
obsessed with learning yes even years
ago when I was gaming for three to six
hours a day I would always carve out
time to learn something new and a lot of
it took away from the quality of my
schoolwork or job but somehow I always
knew that things would work out at first
I thought that this thirst for learning
was the dreaded shiny object syndrome
you know the thing that all successful
people weren't against but if my bursts
of obsession were true shiny object
syndrome I don't think I would be where
I am now the path I've took has led to
something that I couldn't even fathom as
a teen and I want to share it with you
now but in a streamlined fashion without
the road bumps so in the course of 10
years I've obsessed over things like
Fitness Nutrition SEO web design web
development graphic design digital art
social media content writing marketing
and sales copywriting and funnels
neuroscience philosophy spirituality
self-development and the list goes on so
I am cutting it here but there is much
much more and each of these obsessions
lasted about one to three months and the
thing with this is is that I I if I
wanted to learn something outside of
these obsessions I would I wouldn't
laser in on one thing and only do that
one thing I don't think that's really
possible because like if a if I was
obsessed with spirituality and let's say
A nutrition podcast that I was
interested in listening to came across
my notifications or something then I'm
gonna listen to the nutrition podcast
I'm not just gonna ignore my curiosity
because I'm so dedicated to something
else and so what what is the result of
me obsessing all of over all of these
things over the past decade and it's the
one thing that most people think or say
it's impossible and even if they don't
literally say it's impossible they imply
that it's impossible or they tell you
not to focus on the one thing and so the
impossible achievement that I'm talking
about here is doing what I love for a
living it seems like it's a common Trend
right now to be like don't follow your
passion don't do what you love don't do
all of this other for the sake of
grabbing attention and leading you
towards something that eventually leads
to doing what you love or being
passionate about life and so it's kind
of contradictory I get where they're
coming from but I I think it's silly to
write off doing what you love or trying
to live a passionate life because if if
you don't do those things what is the
other option if you want to go all the
way to the negative extreme it's doing
what you hate and never living with a
shred of passion in your life and I
don't think anyone wants to do that and
I do not think that you have to put
those things off until you reach some
form of material success and another
thing is that hopping from skill to
skill didn't prevent me from making an
income at the start I actually believe
that it helped me make more of an income
because if I were starting with one
skill and trying to earn from it there's
a cap on how much you can make per skill
or with a singular skill let's say web
design where it's very it's not
impossible but it's difficult to form a
compelling marketing campaign around
that unlike something like copywriting
and funnels and a much more holistic
skill stack that you can manipulate in a
way to deliver direct results and
promise direct results like I can get
you a hundred New Leads or I can make
you ten thousand extra dollars a month
with web design alone it's kind of hard
to do that so throughout this don't get
trapped in thinking that you can't start
making some form of an income or even
just replace your entire income as you
were learning these skill sets and as
you were going about uh learning over
the next decade because personally I've
talked about this before you can make
money instantly if you know what you're
doing and I recommend that you start
building and executing instantly so that
you can get real world data to iterate
from and learn more in order to improve
it and be able to charge more you aren't
going to come out of the gate charging
five to ten thousand dollars for one
skill it just doesn't work like that you
have to start small and you have to
follow the progression that life
presents it comes in stages and steps
you go five hundred a thousand higher
higher higher and then you eventually
productize and then we've gotten into
that in the previous one-person business
videos so skill stacking is greater than
being a specialist which is greater than
doing nothing at all because you're
afraid of saturation automation or any
other excuse that leads to distraction
we are in a digital Renaissance and
skill stacking stacking a dynamic set of
skills that you can apply in the digital
landscape allows you to build a creative
solution to almost any burning problem
on the market you will reach a point
where you can spot a problem in the
market and you can be like I have the
skills to create a system for this in
order to solve it and I have the
marketing skills to be able to patch
this up and put it in front of the right
people and then making money is a lot
more easier that way you are you become
in control of your income so with my
experience I can get better results than
most specialist Freelancers or agencies
because they this is metaphorical and
Abstract but they know how a will impact
B will impact C and that's it right
that's kind of the specialist nature is
I'm gonna do this in order to get this
very specific Niche result but through
skill stacking and holistic
understanding of the entire digital
domain and just niches in general allows
me to understand how a impacts B impacts
C and how that goes back and impacts a
all the way throughout the alphabet in a
circular motion and how all of those
things interconnect and then my skill
stack in the middle allowing me to kind
of pick and choose whatever I want to do
okay so enough profits let's dive
straight into it so first we need to
stack Evergreen skills for profitability
so here's a graph traffic just to give a
big picture overview of what we're going
to talk about here top left we have
Evergreen skills which we'll dive into
and then once those are paired with
personal interests direct experience and
the internet in the middle you culminate
and create you which becomes
Irreplaceable so if you follow anyone on
social media really they're going to
tell you to learn a specific skill or
start a specific business model like an
agency doing Facebook ads and this isn't
bad advice but I want to take a
different approach because I'm all about
understanding right I want this to
actually make sense to you guys so let's
zoom out and go meta so the skills for
profitability you will be exchanging
value for value and value comes in the
forms of money time social leverage
information or expertise it's not just
money you have to trade the resources
that you have right now whether it be
skill expertise information that other
people don't have social leverage if you
have a lot of followers on one platform
in exchange for uh helping someone on
another platform and then you eventually
can trade your way to money and then you
can trade you can start trading money to
buy back other resources like time so
you will be exchanging this value with
other humans this is transactional and
at the top of everything when
interacting with other humans human
nature and psychology Reigns Supreme so
we need three things the first is a
valuable message a way to communicate
with others that is relevant
understandable or actionable the second
thing is a medium for distribution a way
of putting your valuable message in
front of people or else nobody sees your
value number three is a result oriented
skill which is a way for delivering a
transformation to the people you have
attracted with number one and two
message medium and applicability these
are skills that interact with one
another without one you aren't going to
get the same results this is why it
usually takes six plus months to
actually see some tangible progress in
this domain because you can't just learn
a skill and not put it in front of
someone or have a skill put it in front
of someone and not be able to get
results and then expect to make that
into a sustainable uh business all right
so we're going to start with the message
you need to learn how to create a
compelling message that attracts other
people to not only you but the value
that you have to offer and you need to
be able to articulate the value of both
just the ideas that you're selling you
are selling ideas through content and
just anything that you do whenever you
interact with another person you are
selling something you are selling your
world view your beliefs whatever it may
be and what a lot of creators tend to
glance over is that people can become
interested in anything like a lot of
people come to me and they say I don't
know if I should start writing about
this weird interest because nobody would
be interested in it and it's like that's
not their fault for a lack of
understanding of the interest that's
your fault for not being able to make it
interesting because if you're interested
in that weird topic how did you become
interested in you weren't just born with
that interest there was a gradual steps
that opened your mind and made you aware
of that interest and its importance to
you why is it important in your life and
how can you pass on that importance to
someone else to get them interested in
it right it's not a one and done I post
one tweet and then or one Instagram post
and then oh everyone knows what my
interest is no it's a game it's a 10
year long game of introducing people and
educating people on these interests you
are becoming the person that introduces
people to these interests and makes it
an important part of their life because
it spilled into it's given you many
benefits by incorporating it into your
life so how are you going to help other
people do that so if your words aren't
resonating with other people it's not
them it's you and so you are either
speaking from an advanced level when 95
of the market are beginners you don't
understand persuasion so you have to
answer or imply an answer to the
question what's in it for me or you
didn't capture their attention and
deliver a valuable message to that
attention and so for the last point
value does not always mean actionable
value can be as simple as entertainment
right people like entertainment Netflix
has a lot of value to a specific set of
people because it gives them an escape
from reality and of course there's
different interpretations and
perspectives around that but you get the
point and with that entertaining doesn't
necessarily mean humorous or
mind-numbing I can include a quote or
interesting fact to keep your guys's
attention on this video because it's
entertaining and it introduces you to
something new it gives you a novel idea
so there are two skills that you need to
study in order to learn to craft a
impactful message and that is marketing
which is creating a message that is
attention grabbing relevant and valuable
for a specific person so from their
perspective
the second thing is sales which is a
process for making people aware of their
problems and presenting a solution to
those problems notice how you don't just
Target people that are automatically
aware of everything you do it's it's
process and sales can be synonymous with
storytelling because the human mind
makes sense of the world via stories it
strings things together from past to now
to Future and how it uh interacts with
your situation in life and so they both
sales marketing and story they're all
based around Transformations that's what
people want they want a desirable
outcome in the future they want to avoid
where they were in the past and maybe
they want to get out of the position
that they're in right now they want to
improve and so for the sake of brevity
in this video I I can't go into every
single skill I can't I just can't teach
that I've went into many in the previous
one-person business videos but if you
want the systems for actually one
learning every skill we're going to talk
about here and then applying it in the
real world by starting a one-person
business and productizing yourself check
out digital economics links in the
description so the next thing is the
medium we just talked about the message
now you need a medium for distribution
because in life discipline equals
Freedom shout out Jocko but in business
distribution equals Freedom so with an
internet business distribution comes
from media and code right the back end
of the internet is code and then the
front end what we see is Media so coding
is a great high value skill to learn
it's very important especially when
paired with marketing know-how like if
you can create a software and you
actually know how to Market it which
most startup people don't then you're
way ahead of the game right I I know
there's so many people that are
passionate about coding that create this
app or startup and then they try to
launch it and they don't have an
audience they don't have distribution
they don't have anything backing them
like investors be and which would take
over from the audience but I'm creating
a SAS right now
a note-taking software and with my
marketing know-how and my distribution
and knowing you guys and what will truly
benefit your lives I'm going to have a
more successful launch than any other
Tech founder could simply because they
don't understand marketing and they
haven't built distribution because most
coders only know the technical side they
don't know the human side but many of
you are going down the creative route so
we're not going to be talking about
coding here we're going to be talking
about media so you will have to still
have some technical know-how you will
have to study no code tools that fit
your situation well I'm talking website
Builders uh course dashboards membership
dashboards email marketing software just
social media in general maybe like
Discord you have to understand
technology to an extent at least how to
use it so you build distribution by
growing on top of funnel social media
platforms and we talk about distribution
and leverage in the one-person business
roadmap video and these platforms can be
any of them but I recommend starting
with either Twitter LinkedIn or
Instagram I would argue that Twitter is
the most friendly and not easiest but
simplest to grow on because the retweet
button is very low friction you don't
have to take any pictures you don't have
to understand design all you need to do
is write and practice writing a
persuasive message check out tour a
writer if you want to learn how to do
that and so YouTube podcasts and blogs
are great but when you zoom out as we
always do here and see it from the
bigger picture compared to other
platforms it's a lot more difficult to
grow on those platforms YouTube you have
to get a lot of things right it could be
expensive to actually like have some
form of a nice setup which does
influence your amount of subscribers
podcasts or just hard to grow in general
blogs they depend on SEO so does YouTube
and and I like these but I treat them
more as Authority building platforms at
the start where you're fleshing out your
ideas you're going long form you're
getting practice in and then once you
have the Distribution on bigger
platforms and you can fuel something
like YouTube like if I were to bring my
Twitter followers over to YouTube over
time and my videos start getting better
and better and better and it starts
picking up in the algorithm then those
start to grow later down the road that's
exactly what I did it's not the only way
but it's an effective method that I
found to work for me and so the
principles for growth on these platforms
are all the same you need a valuable
message you need eyeballs on that
message so people follow you if you're
not getting eyes on your content people
aren't going to follow you you do this
by getting shares retweets whatever it
may be networking replying to bigger
accounts or just learning certain
tactics in order to do that the next
thing is consistent effort on getting
your content shared and a brand that
looks like it should have one million
followers I could give like a lot of
branding advice but the thing that I
feel like would be best is does your
profile look like it deserves a million
followers if it doesn't figure out
what's causing that and fix it could be
your banner it could be your bio the the
wording in the bio could be how your
profile picture looks if it doesn't if
your profile picture sucks then watch
some YouTube videos on how to take a
good profile picture with your phone
with good lighting have someone else do
it make it a project have fun with it
spend a day creating the best profile
picture you can so we're talking about
building on social media right as our
medium for distribution but you have to
understand that the medium for
Distributing your message comes before
the social media platform the social
media platform is just a vessel a
modality for that and so writing and
speaking are the mediums for
Distributing your message or at least
articulating your message and packaging
it up so all of my social media growth
and just content in general is based
around writing it doesn't matter if I
have a nice design on Instagram or cool
animated reels it a written script that
I read into this this YouTube video is a
written newsletter beforehand and then I
go off the cusp and the camera but I
follow it along so I have that
persuasive structure and of course all
my other content you can just look and
see it's all written because man this
skill is so important and it's it's hard
to articulate why
um a story is that someone told me or
someone asked a question like is it
easier to go from Twitter to Instagram
rather than Instagram to Twitter and so
I thought about that and it's like yeah
it would because a lot of people from
Instagram uh usually Bank on some form
of vanity or design or something like
that right something good looking like
let's take a fitness influencer for
example they grow and their value is
determined by their body or a fancy car
or something like that and that's
awesome but then when you try and go to
Twitter or any other platform that is
writing based that or that isn't visual
based it's going to be 10 times harder
to grow because you're starting over
from scratch in terms of the skills that
will get you growth and be able to
deliver a valuable message regardless of
external looks and if you combine both
like if you're hot and you have like
this incredible skill stack you're set
for life so we talked about the message
the medium and now you need a
results-oriented skill so we now
understand that we need a valuable
message paired with a medium for
distribution and that's all you need
because those are valuable skills in
themselves and you can create an offer
like you can be a sales closer for
someone you can help people with their
marketing you can be a Content writer
you can become a YouTube video editor
but even then like with that example you
understand the need for results-oriented
skills so by this I mean things like
email marketing sales closing as we said
graphic design videography animation web
design in short you need to understand
how to apply the medium and the message
to the digital landscape so to your own
business like your own personal brand or
someone else's business with technology
and so when you understand how these
pieces work together you can deliver
specific results through that technology
you can write emails that pull in more
customers you can create Graphics that
pull in more followers you can create
videos that hold more attention so you
unlock a new level of power when you
pair Marketing sales and communication
with a specific technology that can be
leveraged for what everyone wants money
followers reputation opportunity freedom
and status as a whole okay so we're
partially done we those were the
Evergreen skills for profitability and
now we need to stack personal interest
for individuality and remember this is a
very long video but this is the meta
approach this is like
like five to ten year time span approach
start with what we talked about but uh
don't hold what we're going to talk
about in the top of your head so that
you can like become aware of them as
you're experiencing life so in these
videos I talk about turning yourself
into the niche uh with a personal brand
but this can also apply when you're
trying to sell to a different customer
Avatar business or just person in
general so with a personal brand your
interests are what makes you unique and
with the Creator economy booming people
think oh it's going to be saturated and
no it's not going to be saturated if you
lean into the interest that make you you
right because everyone can learn these
skills everyone can start talking about
oh learn these high value skills in
order to make money online but few
people are able to synthesize these with
their true interest they're the the
people that can actually do this are the
ones that stand out and so here's
another way of thinking about it is that
when I have an offer a product or
service to sell my interests help me
Niche down who I can sell it to right
because I am my own Niche and my
interest helps shape that so if I'm
interested Fitness let's say my main
topic or skill that I plan to sell
something around is marketing and sales
right but if I'm interested in Fitness
and I incorporate some of my fitness
interests not only does that separate me
from all of the marketing and sales
people but it also attracts other people
that are interested in Fitness and since
I am interested in the fitness scene I
know a lot about my customer Avatar or
or my potential customers I know a lot
about myself because I have that
interest so if I wanted to Niche down to
let's say Fitness coaches and help them
with their marketing then I could do so
so much better and they're getting into
my audience without being sold to
because they follow they want to follow
people that are talking about Fitness so
they can network with bigger players in
the Creator economy and you have to
think about it this way is that most
people they want to go like where the
richest people are they want to work
with people that they despise like like
I hated working for small business
owners I did not like working for small
business owners so if I want to Target
Fitness coaches and I'm attracting them
through my interest of Fitness I would
much rather prefer working with someone
who has that like-minded interest as me
and so it's a win-win because whether
I'm like specifically targeting Fitness
coaches or not I'm still attracting
people that have similar interests to me
and then I can introduce them to
something like marketing and sales and
then that rounds out my brand even more
because I'm helping the fitness people
learn something new while also keeping
the people that are interested in
Marketing sales interested in me because
I'm teaching them something new about
Fitness or I'm introducing them to
another one of my interests and not just
talking about marketing and sales all
the time and so you see how that works
but a lot of people are afraid of
incorporating more interest into their
brand they'll ask things like what if it
doesn't get good engagement and so it's
good that you're answering questions but
do your own q a think these through and
try to answer the questions yourself if
it doesn't get good engagement it's not
because your audience just doesn't like
something like Fitness it's it's because
you didn't make it interesting enough to
them you didn't start Broad and beginner
level and introduce them to the
importance of that topic before you
start diving into some advanced stuff
that nobody cares about and yes going
Broad and beginner will still attract
Advanced people let's say your target
audience is someone more advanced your
offer is more advanced and you have to
educate them to get to that point
Advanced people still follow beginner
level advice if you talk about the
fundamentals the advanced people know
how important those are that like I
would consider myself advanced in the
fitness scene and I've all the people
that I follow they're talking about the
fundamentals of diet they're reminding
me of what I need to know most people
don't need to most people don't need
something new they need to be reminded
of what works so another question is
what if I don't make any sales again we
need to zoom out and view this from a
big picture you're not going to be hard
promoting in every single post and so on
a five year time scale right expand the
time Horizon on a five-year time scale
if twenty percent like maximum if twenty
percent of your posts are nothing to do
with the thing that you sell but eighty
percent are do you really think that's
gonna make like a big difference in how
many sales you make like will it really
impact overall Revenue if one you're not
hard promoting every single day two you
twenty percent of your content on the
parts where you aren't hard promoting
like answer the question yourself here
you're thinking too small so another
question is what if my interest has
nothing to do with the thing that makes
me money get creative use it as a way to
help people understand I'm interested in
EDM electronic dance music and so I
notice patterns between that and let's
say online business or Creator economy
and I like to make the link between how
EDM producers or DJs how they kind of
synthesize song or synths or sounds into
songs how creators they synthesize ideas
and quotes and other things and just in
general into content and so it just
makes it more challenging which is good
and rewarding to try to note the
patterns between the things that don't
really go together or so you think
everything is connected alright so that
was stacking personal interest so we
have stacking Evergreen skills and then
that was stacking personal interest and
so now we need to stack experience for
nuance and navigation nothing happens
then everything happens when you are on
the path of Mastery for life not in one
skill but in one domain AKA your life
and what you're interested in you will
experience this lesson of nothing
happens then everything happens multiple
times so from the book Mastery by George
Leonard Mastery is the mysterious
process during which what is at first
difficult becomes progressively easier
and more pleasurable through practice so
this is the opposite of instant
gratification and it's why it's so
difficult to internalize or understand
without action is because everyone wants
to understand immediately instant
gratification goes far beyond just like
wanting having like a material desire
for something it's it's everything it's
the need for like for immediate
understanding it's the need for
immediately fixing like an emotional
problem that you're going through it's
everything people just want
everything right now and you can't have
it you have an entire life ahead of you
calm down and so with this I'm not gonna
give you exact steps that you can take
here to baby you along the way and
stroke your mental
thing I am however and have given you
the meta skills to start researching for
yourself right you're going to have to
follow the Curiosity that you have after
going through this like oh what what's
the fundamentals of Marketing sales go
look it up and so in terms of experience
your job is to hold
what I just told you about nothing
happens then everything happens and what
I'm about to tell you in your mind as
you go along this journey because it
will help so by sticking things out you
will experience short bursts of intense
progress lean into those and enjoy them
so the two skills that will help you
implement everything above that we just
talked about is rapid learning and Rapid
execution and so when those are combined
we can consider them rapid building I
made an entire video on this it's called
learn new skills fast how I remember
everything I learned one of the less
popular videos that sucks I encourage
you to watch it because it's extremely
important but in short here's what you
do choose a project to emulate this
should incorporate the skills you are
trying to learn start building your own
version create an outline for your
project and build until you hit a wall
seek specific knowledge when you hit a
wall learn the skills necessary for that
specific real world situation this helps
you cut through the fluff that can be
learned through experience and a bonus
teach along the way teaching will
identify your knowledge gaps meaning you
can seek more specific knowledge so my
favorite way of integrating everything
we've talked about and starting to
practice all these skills immediately is
by starting a one-person business a
personal brand why because it's a
business right like uh a lot of people
in that start freelancing or something
like that they're like oh I want to
practice SEO so I'm going to try and
land a client relating to SEO and it's
like you could just start your own
website for your own business about what
you're building and what you're doing in
life watch the other videos about your
goal in life and how you're going to get
there and practice SEO that way on your
own blog practice design by creating
your own profile Banner in your profile
picture practice persuasion by writing
content practice
distribution by getting eyes on your
profile and learning the tactics
relating to that and supplementing all
of this with the educational resources
necessary like a course a YouTube video
or something along those lines so you
can also write copy for your sales page
or your promotions you can create your
own minimum viable offer start to Market
that or you can affiliate for a product
and practice your marketing skills on
that and so the skill stack that you
develop by building your own personal
brand for a year can transition over
into almost any online business and with
your marketing knowledge you'll already
know what to do you'll just be like I'm
going to create this offer and I'm going
to sell it to this guy and I have so
much leverage already with my personal
brand I have X amount of followers which
is more than the average person so when
I DM them they're going to be much more
likely to DM me and you're just making
it so much easier on yourself by
building a personal brand I wish I did
this I really do that's why I talk about
it so much now and yes I sell courses
and stuff relating to this because I
genuinely believe in them and how this
has changed my life I've straight up
switched all of the courses that I offer
because of this new thing that I learned
and I feel like I have to spread it to
you guys so that was rapid learning and
Rapid execution for your burst of
building when you feel the urge to go
all in on this stuff when you have the
clarity and education
necessary to actually get started the
next thing is you have to tend to your
perspective throughout the entirety of
online business one percent of 50 years
is six months and six months is just the
start of the beginning if you're on the
path of Mastery you're on it for life I
mentioned earlier that shiny object
syndrome isn't a bad thing but the bad
shiny object syndrome is the thing that
takes you off the path of Mastery so
learning a new skill that complements
your other ones and allows you to push
to new levels in business isn't a bad
thing right you're allowed to both learn
web design and copywriting and so on and
so forth until you have a big picture
understanding of the online business
domain as a whole your skills compound
and no one can take them away from you
self-education is or investing in your
own education is usually never a waste
it's only a waste if you aren't building
something along the way because you
won't remember anything you'll have
nothing to show for it in terms of both
knowledge and just real world
tangibility so when a shiny object or
distraction registers in your awareness
and you allow your focus to narrow in on
it you close your mind to the depth of
your craft and the distractions are just
that they're they're a temporary bump in
the path because once you've started
down the path of Mastery you can't
you can't go away from it because the
only reason you start on the path of
Mastery is because you got that missing
piece in your mind that finally made it
click for you and made you realize that
it was possible and that you can see
through all of your excuses for not
making whatever it is that you want to
make work work and so once you see that
there's no going back it's always going
to pop into your head when you're
sitting there doing nothing and you're
thinking man I I know you're not going
to say this directly it sounds kind of
weird but you're going to say I know my
potential why am I wasting it right now
again the most important pattern here is
uh nothing happens and then everything
happens so you have to zoom out you have
to see your work from the perspective of
your life's work that 50 years right
that time Horizon in six months is one
percent of 50 years because Mastery is a
cyclical cyclical it happens it repeats
a cyclical process of slow or no
progress followed by intense bursts of
prog progress in business this first
exponential leap to kind of the next
stair
step it usually happens after six months
that's a pattern that I've noticed in
many people starting business is that if
you can stick it out and stay consistent
for six months around that six months
Mark you're going to have that leap and
you're gonna know okay this is possible
and that's usually when most people
commit for Life some still fall off of
course but then after this like a few
months after this it's followed by
Massive Resistance like you're going to
feel like you aren't making any progress
or as much progress as you should be
this is normal so you have to zoom out
you have to gain a big picture
understanding view the world from better
perspective and notice that months of
potential despair are just a part of the
journey nobody said that they weren't
supposed to be there nobody said that
you're supposed to feel good or bad
nobody said it's going to be easy or
hard those are expectations that you
hold in your mind see beyond them so the
next thing and last thing is gradual
awareness of the domain because when you
learn one skill a field of awareness
opens around it right so let's start to
paint a picture here as best we can but
let's say this is the skill you learn
and the domain around it is like a light
in a dark room like a candle in a dark
room and so you're using that skill to
navigate and it allows you to become
aware of other skills and opportunities
that you can learn or take on and so
then when you learn that then field of
awareness opens around that so now you
have two and they're connected but then
you get three and you get four and then
you full circle and now you have
awareness of this much larger domain
that you can act within and solve
problems Within by connecting your
skills and so this field of awareness
that you create by mastering or not
necessarily mastering but understanding
one skill and then the next and then the
next and then the next and then the next
and your personal interests and your
experience in life and all of these
different things you're expanding your
field of awareness and that is where you
can solve creative problems that is
where you're going to make money so
commit to the path stack Evergreen
skills for profitability which is the
medium message and results or oriented
skills stack personal interests for
individuality and then stack experience
for nuance and navigation of the domain
