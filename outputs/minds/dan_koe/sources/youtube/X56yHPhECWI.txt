all right let's just be real nobody
wants to work a nine to five if
you do you're lying to yourself and you
are stunting
or limiting your potential so i would
not recommend that from the start and
there is more than enough possibility
especially for anyone listening to
this video watching this video
because you are curious right 99 of the
world is not curious you have to
understand this and it's very hard to
understand this when you are not fully
aware of it right i've been creating for
a long time i am very fully aware
of human behavior and what people do and
i just want to start this video off
by saying
don't limit yourself okay
not worthwhile and you can monetize your
passions now first let's let's clear the
room
passion is very
subjective it's touchy but it usually
follows
the dopamine that you receive from
making connections in the things that
you are curious or interested in okay so
that's where this all starts curiosity
and interest you're curious you're
watching this video you probably have
other interests
outside of business or monetization or
marketing or stuff like that and that's
where you have to start with all this
you have to start with a skill
or an interest area so by skills i mean
marketable skills usually falling in the
marketing discipline so
design
email marketing
direct response marketing copywriting
same thing lead generation sales all of
that good stuff i would start with
direct response marketing and sales
because that helps you understand the
landscape much more and it will it will
put you further ahead than most
when you understand those because then
you'll be like oh i can monetize any
skill i want
so i'd recommend starting with that and
then in terms of areas of interest most
things that fall under the the eternal
markets so health wealth relationships
breaking those down
so
health fitness coaching very lucrative
wealth helping people make more money
very lucrative or save time or whatever
impacts wealth
mental health under health relationships
big problems for a lot of people that's
what you're looking for a big problem
that you can fill or solve with your
skill set or expertise in a specific
interest area that's where this all
starts and that's where you need to
become
very well read from this from the start
spend two to three months learning
implementing
if it's an interest area you can start
to get results for yourself in the gym
um in your relationships all of that fun
stuff self-improvement stuff right and
now what we do with this to start off
the monetization of your passions and to
start making
pretty good money within a year is by
starting a one person business
that's you one person and it has to be a
service business
at first it doesn't have to be if you
have an interest area you can go
the product or digital product route but
for right now
we're starting with a service business
because that's the easiest way to get
massive results that you can leverage
for the rest of your life so there's
freelancing with your skills that's
pretty self-explanatory landing clients
same with coaching
right fitness coaching performance
coaching mental health coaching
life coaching kind of it's kind of
cringe but it's performance coaching
somewhat
relationships coaching all very
lucrative and then consulting is also
skill based so instead of freelancing
you can consult people on increasing
their revenue with whatever skill you
have or building systems or whatever
you're good at whatever you have studied
and now i want to bring emphasis back to
learning direct response marketing
sales
and branding as well so design learning
all of these things and the skills will
start to culminate because that's where
the problem stems with most people they
learn a skill it's like oh i want to
learn how i want to learn graphic design
but then it comes time to sell and
you're like well i enjoyed
creating some fun projects but i have no
idea how to do it for other people in
exchange for money that's marketing
that's sales if you don't learn those
two you're so next you understand
marketing and sales and if you did study
those you understand that the first
thing you should do in order to get
in front of people is by distribution
manual distribution so you can watch my
previous video so i don't have to go on
for 20 minutes about this but how to
land your first client with ease i give
you some tricks make it extremely simple
for you
go view that i'll put the video
somewhere so next off we've started
landing some clients we are increasing
our prices per that other video and now
it's time to build an audience why do
you want to build an audience one
because it is digital real estate right
it's free traffic that you earn with
your time and expertise and quality
content it's like i i personally on
twitter i
average between 5 and 10 million
impressions on when i looked this up on
google for paid ads that would cost me
thirty five thousand to seventy thousand
dollars i have that for free just by
growing on the platform for a year or
two okay and then at this point you have
people coming to you for your service so
you don't have to do the manual outreach
you've built free distribution and now
also uh pertaining to the social media
platforms you have to understand how to
grow on them that's another thing a lot
of people fail at is they
go to the social media platforms
but then they have no idea how to grow
and they end up giving up failing it
does take consistency it's very hard to
grow from a low follower account that's
going to take the most time but i would
just personally recommend
investing in a course or something that
teaches you how to grow on any specific
platform if you are opposed to courses
one that's just stupid stop it
courses are extremely valuable so as
your audience starts to grow you can
start to monetize it via your services
and promoting yourself and getting in
front of more people
eventually you can productize your stuff
and promote that but
the thing here is that a lot of
influencers with a million bucks are
making less than uh smaller accounts
with like i mean a million follower
accounts are making less than ten
thousand follower accounts because they
don't understand
marketing and sales
understand that and the world will open
up to you and everything will start to
make sense the next thing is how do you
grow right how do you set yourself apart
because it's very easy to
get caught in the
the flow of all the basic advice and the
the thing about this is that the people
that grow very quickly from the start
are usually very experienced people
keyword
experience they have good stories to
tell they've built businesses they have
expertise in a specific
area that allows them to give
extremely valuable advice on that
platform and build authority now if you
do not have that one you're starting to
build a service business right
so you can do the build in public route
because the the thing about followers is
that followers follow leaders no
makes sense right you have to be a
leader in improving yourself and doing
good things in order to be interesting
enough for someone to follow you you
have to be building something you have
to be documenting your process you have
to be showing people hey
you're teaching that's all social media
is is you're just passing down lessons
that's all any of this is so
leaders are building something and if
you are building something you are
stacking experience you are one step
ahead
of another person of your former self
right and you can teach your former self
or you can teach the person that's one
step behind you because here's the thing
often
the best teacher is the person that is
one step ahead of you not the person
that's 10 steps ahead of you i
personally think like
there's nuance to this but i think the
whole advice of like oh find a mentor
that's making billions upon billions of
dollars
no they are out of the beginner mindset
they don't understand it anymore and
you're not going to understand what
they're saying because you haven't
experienced everything up until that
point you don't have awareness of
anything that's going on in their
business model or whatever they're
teaching you so it is more effective to
teach the person that is directly under
you and that's how you do this on social
media that's the build in public thing
it's like hey i'm building this here's
how i did it
and people can follow in your footsteps
and you become a leader that way so
people follow you the next step is
productization productizing your self
because
the world is going personal big
businesses just don't cut it anymore
there's no human touch people crave that
 man that's why they're so sucked up
in social media and the news is because
they're they're like grasping for some
form of human connection right so the
personal market especially like more
people are going remote more people more
businesses are hiring
independent contractors all of that fun
stuff
decentralization whatever it may be it's
going down to an individual level and
that's why this is
an absolutely amazing time to get into
this and it will continue to be until
people catch on
which as i said at the beginning 99 of
people won't so how do you make money
with this you have the service business
you have some results there
you've made some money already but how
do you make more money how do you scale
while freeing up more time on your hands
how do you become more protective of
your time well you've developed
specific systems unique systems for
getting results
in the eternal markets health wealth
relationships right whether it be your
service business let's say you're a
freelancer
you are a freelancer you have gotten
your clients results using whatever
system you use
you have billions of different
choices actions thoughts
lessons failures successes that you can
help people navigate through
in your
product whatever you create an info
product probably the information market
is absolutely ginormous there are people
selling courses and information and
teaching that's what it is teaching
other people how to
take pictures of birds
photography lessons for taking pictures
of birds and this guy pulls in seven
figures a year a million dollars there's
another guy who has become so immensely
valuable and has stacked so much
expertise that he charges twenty
thousand dollars a year for membership
to his facebook group
okay
that's where all of this can go and now
you take a fraction of that
you get to six figures which if you have
a poor relationship with money or
just have a scarce mindset like this is
gonna sound like a huge number to you
and i don't mean to
uh have you take offense at that it
comes with time but six figures it's
more than possible extremely more than
possible in a year or two
possibly even less if you execute and
depending
on
what experience level you have right now
but that's the thing you stack
experience you get results in health
wealth relationships and then you
package up the way that you got those
results
per you how you did it okay this is how
you form a personal monopoly this is how
you set yourself apart from the
competition because nobody can copy
those unique systems that you use to get
results and now let's say you're a
freelancer and you got results and you
package that up but you've built an
audience to a point where they love you
not what you talk about you can go and
sell anything
right if i wanted to i'm a big fitness
guy been into fitness for most of my
life if i want to turn around and go and
sell a fitness product i could make a
lot of money off of that
guaranteed just because it's what i do i
start talking about it it's a big
problem in people's lives fitness health
there's a lot of problems i can target
there and i can sell
what i personally do to get results so
that is about it that's the roadmap i
encourage you to get started and i
encourage you to take this small risk on
yourself
because
the other route the secure route the
comfortable route
is a much much much bigger risk to take
take a small risk now and save yourself
the pain later
and just start thanks for watching and

we just talked about link in the
description i appreciate you guys
