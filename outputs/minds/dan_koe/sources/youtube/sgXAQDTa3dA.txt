the internet enables 8 billion
monopolies that is a quote from Naval
our cliche a bit too simple but
extremely deep and I don't know why I am
still reading the same thread that he
wrote a year ago Overlord that he is he
is the Lord and savior of all of
the basic advice people but Naval hits a
bit different and he has experienced the
back it I absolutely love Naval but
we're here to talk about just that we're
here to talk about the one person
business model why because I feel like
way too many people have dreams of
starting like a billion dollar company
or being the next Jeff Bezos or being
the next Elon Musk because that's what
we see and the thing is is like the gap
between where you are now because I'm
assuming you haven't started a business
or else you wouldn't be dreaming of that
the gap between where you are and where
they are is causing so much overwhelm
because you don't have a way of getting
there right that is what Clarity is and
that's what the lack of clarity is what
causes overwhelm and anxiety and just
psychic entropy or mental disorder not a
mental disorder but disorder of the mind
in general now before we start you have
to understand one thing you have to
understand that humans are the only
being that can have an idea and make it
real now things like chimpanzees and
other things they they use tools they
use other things but what other being
has constructed this world that we live
in with our minds we have constructed
the school system the government
religious beliefs we've constructed
language from nothing but images and
symbols does this not blow your mind we
didn't have language at some point in
time right we had the ability we had
Consciousness attention focus and the
tools necessary to connect these ideas
and make them tangible and just be able
to communicate and form relationships
with other people and that's a
discussion for a whole other topic about
the traps and downsides of all of that
because it controls many people's lives
but I would argue that that is one key
to a high quality of life is just
leaning into your nature as a Creator as
a builder and actually building things
rather than watching other people build
things and just do absolutely nothing
about it you see self-reliance is
possibly the greatest value in my life
it has brought me the most value as
values should
because
when people would tell me and this is in
relation to a one-person business as a
Creator I used to be a freelancer I did
coaching for a bit I did Consulting I
pretty much did every one person
business offer under the sun I've sold
I hate talking numbers whatever for
credibility and Authority purposes I've
sold a hundred thousand dollars plus of
almost everything that I went into
freelancing coaching Consulting digital
products cohorts everything under the
sun and that's why I talk about this
stuff because one I have direct
experience with it two I know the steps
you should take and I know that people
over complicated way too much so in
pertaining to business when people were
screaming at me to go or to just go and
do all this short form stuff like reels
which I do but go and do reels because
it's the future or or hop on this next
business model or do this and do that
and it's like I already have something
good going and I'm going to go in the
opposite direction because success is
counterintuitive and that is also a
value of mine is kind of
counterintuitiveness and being skeptical
and so
what I did was the opposite when people
told me to go short form I started
writing long form newsletters and that
self-reliance me trying to figure things
out for myself has taught me more than
any other course any college anything
that's how you learn that's true
learning is by directly experiencing
something by not taking people's advice
as law testing it for yourself and this
is not only pertaining to business this
is pertaining to health and any ideology
or belief system in general is like when
someone comes up and is like hey Raw
Liver is the best thing you can eat I
got stuck in that trap but it's not like
you you have to see multiple
perspectives because that's what life is
is just a conglomeration of perspectives
and goals that people are trying to hit
problems and benefits and all this other
stuff that form a singular perspective
that makes someone believe something and
so accepting a specific ideology as law
is just closing your mind off to any
opportunity you can have so back to the
topic at hand we're here to talk about
the one person business model which I
believe is the best route for 95 plus
percent of people that want to start a
business because one it follows
a human progression pattern you evolve
with time right so a lot of people that
I know and myself included they start
out in one of two ways that require zero
experience one is skill based right
so we're talking marketable skills so
design
photography email marketing copywriting
SEO web design all that stuff you you
know those things and you've probably
learned some of those things but the
next thing because those are like you're
starting a freelancing business but what
about a coaching business that is where
self-development comes into play so it's
either skill based or development based
right and so this is pertaining to
building an audience or just giving
value and educating people so they will
buy your product or service your
freelancing service your digital product
your Consulting service whatever it may
be right so they start with skill based
and then they educate people on those
skills so if I am a writer which I am
then I will teach you how to write I
will give out little tips I will write
articles on writing if I am a mindset
guy through self-development then I'm
going to give out mindset tips I'm going
to give out education on strengthening
your mind etc etc This falls under the
health wealth relationship ships
Eternal markets health wealth
relationships and happiness and then the
skill based is kind of like you use that
to complement your self-development so
you can make money a bit faster because
a high ticket service like a freelancing
offer you can sell for two to three
thousand dollars once you get good and
then you can sell it through your
audience
or just Reach Out directly to people and
try to land via cold Outreach or
something of that nature and you can
make money a lot quicker so those are
the two routes that people go and and
from my experience and from my failures
I always recommend people start posting
content why because a lot of people
starting freelancing or coaching and
they
to get stuck in this cycle of like you
have to do manual labor in order to get
clients you have to send cold emails you
have to send call DMS and you're not
you don't have a brand that is educating
people on those things and building
trust and Authority without you having
to do it in the DMS manually every
single time so you build an audience
along the way and then once you get to a
certain point once you have a certain
amount of traffic and a certain amount
of brand loyalty and Authority clients
start coming to you and then once your
audience gets larger and larger you can
productize your service reduce your time
spent on that client work and sell
something like a digital product or if
you're in the self-development space
like mindset or health coaching or
something of that nature you can create
a physical product it doesn't always
have to be a digital product or a course
it can be something like as an example I
talk about self-development a lot I talk
about focus a lot I want to create a
coffee brand with coffee and l-theanine
and if I talk about that more and show
myself doing that people are going to
buy it because it's something good and
something useful in people's lives and I
am the unique mechanism the personal
brand is the unique mechanism and is why
people will buy from me over someone
else is because I have built that
connection with you guys by trying to be
as honest and transparent about this as
possible so we're going to walk through
what I call the entrepreneurial method
which is just kind of like a spin-off of
the scientific method but we have to
understand here like how do we apply
this before we can actually get into it
so the way that we apply this is for a
one-person business you need three
things you need a brand which is like
your audience in a sense or like your
storefront it's how you're you are
perceived right so you need a brand and
the way you brand is you brand a
one-person business based on yourself
right it's a personal brand it's a
personal business and it the brand
revolves around your vision for the
future and your goals that is what you
are leading people towards because
followers follow leaders right so if you
are not a leader then don't try to start
a business so the next thing how do you
attract people to to that brand how do
you build a following content and your
content is Created from your interests
so self-development or skills which are
the skill based things that I talked
about and you educating people on that
while also throwing in your unique spin
here and there right talking about your
interests and educating people on your
interests and skills and throwing in
your own personal thoughts your own
beliefs maybe some mindset stuff maybe
what you're doing on a daily basis right
you entertain educate and Inspire with
your content and you learn how to write
or structure content in a way that
catches attention delivers value on that
attention and then converts the
attention to either a follow or a
purchase or an email subscriber and then
you slowly build leverage over time
to get to the point of what we talked
about earlier and now the last thing the
way you monetize because people screw
this up so much uh because it's like how
do I monetize from a platform where it's
like YouTube you can do AdSense and
that's great I do that and it's like
other people can do that but it's not in
your control right you can be taken down
from the platform at any time and if you
don't have an email list or your own
product or service that you create and
you control
the price and both the traffic going to
it that is what determines your income
so if you want to actually build an
income online you need to become
valuable enough to sell a product or
service to a person that is one to two
steps behind you or just has a use case
in your life so it has a use case in
other people's lives if I like coffee
and I use it to focus then I'm going to
create an l-theanine coffee brand and
sell it to my audience while talking
about productivity and focus it is that
simple given time and not quitting
because you didn't see results after two
weeks alright now to the entrepreneurial
method because this is something we do
on a daily basis
and it's just like a universal principle
that people need to follow in order to
not only like increase their quality of
life and solve their own problems but
also profit off of that to profit off of
your own self-development and your own
skill acquisition because that's just
the thing if you are starting out from
zero it's no problem you talk you write
content about what you are learning your
brand is your vision for the future so
if you're starting a freelance business
and you plan to take that to ten
thousand dollars a month and that's your
vision or your goals for the future then
that's your brand hey follow me along as
I build this freelance business to ten
thousand dollars a month now if you are
already valuable if you've already
developed those skills you've already
developed yourself or your mind then you
have a bit more Authority and you
already know what you should be talking
about and the value you should be
creating online now one thing I want to
mention here with content is that
you're not trying to reinvent the wheel
like you have to be self-aware here
that's what self-reliance is in the
one-person business is being self-aware
what kind of content do you like to
consume right is it too basic or is it
unique to you right or are you reading
the same exact thing week after
week people need to be reminded more
than they need something new that's all
content is is you are joining in and
you're giving your own take on the same
thing that people are saying that
results in growth if you aren't growing
on social media it's usually because
your ego is in the way and you are
trying you are over complicating things
way too much and you're trying to be too
fancy or too clever and you get mad
because people are because you think
people aren't as intelligent as you or
just don't get it and it's like yeah
they don't get it so listen to the
feedback and change how you talk about
things so it's actually interesting if
people aren't interested in your
interest it's because you you don't know
how to make your interest interesting to
that person so the entrepreneurial
method here it is you find a problem you
learn how to solve it you document how
you solved it online you systemize your
process and you share your discoveries
so in a nutshell you find a problem in
your life right that's step number one
is find a problem because all stories
marketing literally everything the thing
that drives human behavior are problems
right if I were to read you a story and
it started with there was a cold spot on
the side of the bed
that opens a curiosity Loop and people
want to learn more you want to learn
more once you become aware of your own
problems and that they are actually a
problem right once you identify a
problem let's say with your health then
you're going to self-educate in order to
get there right that leads into step two
is self-educate so let's say that you
find yourself lacking self-esteem that
is a health problem because one maybe
you don't have muscle mass or you just
don't like how you look and that is a
surface level problem right if you want
to understand this from the lens of
finding your purpose I have another
video
um I would look that up it's like how to
find your purpose by solving your own
problems it's the same thing you have to
solve those shallow external problems
first and then bust through to your
inner core to get to the meaning and
purpose of everything because we've
shrouded over it with all of these
comparisons self comparison to other
people and all these things that are
creating the shallow problems but you
can't just ignore those you have to
solve them because that's what most
people are struggling with and that's
how you can help them once you actually
solve for yourself right you have to
develop yourself and your skill set so
if you have a health problem and maybe
you need to go and learn how to hit the
gym and then you become good at hitting
the gym or you find this unique take or
create your own system for becoming
jacked or whatever it may be then you
can teach people about that and of
course use your own head here use your
critical thinking and understand like
when it's Justified whether you can sell
a product or not the the people that are
going to sell a product will sell a
product so that's on the individual and
I just can't help you with that this is
a free video I'm not talking with you
one-on-one just have some common sense
and be smart about what you're selling
so another thing if you want to fix a
money problem let's say you're broke
college student and you understand that
college is going to give you some money
yeah it's going to give you some cash
flow but it's going to be a cap on your
income and you don't like that so you
start a freelancing business you start
learning a skill see how a problem leads
to self-education which is self step
number two is learn how to solve it then
you self-educate you get results and
then you talk about those results and
then you document that's you documenting
how you solved it online that leads into
step number three and that is also how
you learn more about yourself and about
the skill you're doing right because if
you the problem here is that people
always think they lack experience and
it's like oh I like I I feel like an
imposter when I'm posting content online
like I I know a lot about web design and
I'm trying to land my first client but I
can't post about it online that's just
weird it's like dude if you're gonna try
and make money off of someone by
reaching out to them with a freelance
service then why the are you scared
to post free content online it doesn't
make sense the free content online
should come first and should be a way of
you distilling what you learn and
organizing your thoughts so that other
people can benefit from it and you can
build authority to the point of Landing
a client right so you have to understand
like people see me now and you're
watching this on YouTube so it's a bit
different it's not on Instagram or it's
not on Twitter where I have a much
larger following and like people see
that Gap right they're like oh this guy
has 240 000 followers on Instagram it's
gonna take forever to get there which it
is but that doesn't mean like that I
didn't see results along the way there
right again you're paying attention to
the Gap and that's what's causing the
overwhelm anxiety and procrastination
rather than the first step in front of
you which is just starting and doing so
what you don't see is that I'm a regular
ass dude maybe I have some cool Lighting
in the background and maybe I
I don't know like what what do you
perceive of me how do you think of me
which I guarantee you it's not who I am
but how do you perceive me right is
there a Gap there do you see me as a bit
authoritative because I want to let you
know that I'm just a regular
dude right I identified a problem in my
life I was a young broke college student
and as exactly what I said earlier I
didn't want to get a job that limited my
potential future in terms of how much I
could make so I started learning every
single skill that I could Under the Sun
and then once I saw results with
freelancing I did it kind of backwards
of what I'm recommending then I started
posting online about my results with web
design and freelancing taught people
about web design talked about my
self-development journey talked about
mindset talked about skill acquisition
money and I grew an audience I
eventually created a digital product
showing how I uh went or how I started
my web design business and that iterated
over time right with the scientific
process or the entrepreneurial process
iteration is such a big part of
everything and that's what the one
person business does it evolves so if
you are afraid of saturation in this
stuff you have to understand that if you
are starting a Creator business or a
one-person business there is no
saturation it's kind of impossible
because we evolve I evolved from
freelancing to Consulting so I opened up
a job in the freelance market after I
left it and then after I left Consulting
and started the cohort and was doing
digital products As I Grew an audience
then I desaturated that market right
that offer that made me a lot of money I
am not selling anymore so other people
can come in and sell something similar
and take that spot if they wanted to
right and now if I want to transition
eventually and just Bank on like book
sales or start a software company then I
desaturated the market even more so you
have to understand that the internet
enables 8 billion Monopoly it really
does there is room for everyone because
one you're thinking there's too much
saturation because you haven't started
again it's a gap you're guessing what's
in between that Gap rather than figuring
it out for yourself and so a side note
is that someone asked me recently and
they were like uh I'm thinking about
growing an audience and talking about my
interests and eventually making an
income but how long will it take and so
like my question is if you're gonna see
yourself doing this for the rest of your
life right if this is the thing that you
want to do for the rest of your life
then why does it matter how long
it will take because if you're going to
come back to it anyways why not start
now get the failures that you have to
have they're necessary you have to have
a certain amount of failures to see
success
once you get those out of the way
as soon as possible the sooner you're
going to see success and actually be
able to do it for the rest of your life
and what happens if you don't do that
then you're not going to be doing the
thing you want for the rest of your life
so step number four is to distill things
into a replicable process right that's
what people want they want step-by-step
advice on how to get a specific end
result that's what every single thing
does unless you create like a tool or a
product or something that is just useful
in people's lives or they want to be but
if you want to make money from the start
you need to just focus on distilling a
process or creating a system right and
so the way you do this this ties in with
learning and self-education and
self-reliance because if you hire
someone to do this All For You Like if
you if I hired someone
or if I paid someone for uh Fitness
coaching and I just followed their
advice to a T I didn't learn anything
for myself you have to experiment you
have to try different things you have to
see what works for you you have to find
that Discovery by figuring it out and
struggling and not taking the easy route
so that you can take that and teach it
from your own unique point of view so
for step number five is to share your
discoveries is to give your discoveries
or your process to someone that wants to
be helped now I want to wrap this video
up in Step number five by asking you a
very difficult question which is what is
the meaning of life so from my own
experimentation and self-education and
researching multiple different
perspectives you see what I'm doing here
and figuring things out I've noticed a
few patterns I've noticed kind of a
two-step system
for the meaning of life now we can't
lump this entire question into this but
I just want to spark some thought and
awareness in you so the first thing
leaning into the meaning of life is
raising your Consciousness and what that
means is actively exploring the unknown
aspects of reality which means you're
not straying away from challenge or
failure or the dark areas of the human
experience that are going to be there
whether you deny them or not so you are
actively exploring and feeling into your
problems learning how to solve them and
directly experiencing yourself solving
them so that you get that you get those
results and you truly learn and you
raise your conscious Consciousness
around that domain of reality so you are
making the Unknown Known the unconscious
conscious by solving your own problems
and becoming aware of the unconscious
and making it conscious you're making
the unpredictable predictable so the
unpredictable nature of solopreneurship
you're making that predictable and
you're helping other people get there so
the second thing after raising your own
Consciousness is raising the collective
Consciousness so what you're doing is
you are when you're raising your
Consciousness you're creating a map of
reality you're creating a map of the
unknown or what is unknown to other
people and then you teaching it to them
helps accelerate the level of the
collective Consciousness much faster if
you are teaching them and of course
basing your teaching and making it known
that they have to self-educate and they
have to figure it out for themselves as
well and raise their own Consciousness
then that is somewhat the meaning to
life and I can attest that it isn't a
 incredible feeling when you help
someone else get results and solve the
problems that they want to solve so you
raise the collective Consciousness by
giving out pieces of your map by writing
online or posting online right and so
attracting a following I that's what
social media is for and then your
products themselves are the map right
they are the map you are distilling and
like enclosing it into a little zip file
to upload in other people's brains
because then the next thing is like oh
Dan well like what if I like people are
already selling this thing and like it's
already for free online and you have to
understand like that only a specific
certain like a specific type of person
says that one the people that aren't in
the game of business two they aren't
just in the arena to the like they don't
have the money to invest in those kinds
of products right because what people
pay for is aggregation speed and
convenience right that's just everywhere
around us like why do you go and buy
something that is terrible for your
health rather than just eating the good
food you have at home it's convenience
right so why would I spend
20 hours filtering through just like
fragmented YouTube videos on the
internet rather than just a step-by-step
course on how to get an end result and
then get it now the thing with this is
that you can't help people that don't
want to be helped like if people just
twist your words there's there's
probably some people watching this the
like two dislikes
that you don't see anymore I wish people
could see them because it's kind of like
credibility it's like if if everyone
agreed with me then I wouldn't be saying
something that is closer to truth but I
don't know there's weird stuff with that
but the the thing is that people don't
people
that don't want to be helped you can't
help them right so you have to be okay
with the hate and the criticism that
comes along with this stuff if people
don't want to increase their quality of
life and they're stuck in this ego trap
then it's okay you can't help them so I
will end with this the lips of wisdom
are closed except to the ears of
understanding and that is a quote from
the cabalion and it just hits so the
ancient Masters are saying the same
thing you can't help people that don't
want to be helped but if you want to be
helped in more videos hit subscribe hit
