how do I start a business how do I start
talking to people how do I start
pursuing my goals by starting advice is
not starting asking for advice is making
you stupid most people ask for advice
because they fear the embarrassment and
failure that everyone else went through
to achieve their goals now don't get me
wrong advice is not always a bad thing
but if the 99 of people that are
unsuccessful ask for 99 of the advice
maybe there is a lesson there that's why
there are books upon books on how to
start a business or how to get six-pack
abs and 99 of people still don't have
those things and 99 of the questions
that people ask are so vague that it is
literally impossible to answer it's just
a waste of time to ask the question in
the first place because it's like ah yes
let me write four books and create a
hundred YouTube videos on the subject so
you can completely understand it to the
point where you can avoid any and all
trial and error and failure that I went
through in order to get what you want
write your own book live your own life
stop sitting around doing things that
don't result in experience boosts you
will never get a truly actionable answer
by Outsourcing your entire Learning
Journey out of fear of that Journey the
problem is a lack of understanding
people don't understand how to learn
they've never sat down and contemplated
what the learning process looks like and
most people haven't asked for advice on
how to learn so my point is that people
are asking the wrong questions from the
start when they approach a new goal they
don't have the learning process framing
their decisions step one is to have a
conscious meaningful goal step two is to
start forming the habits that allow that
goal to be achieved step three is to
manage the pain and emotions that come
with identity change step four is to
program your mind with information
relevant to that goal step five is to
experiment with different techniques
step six is to seek technical advice
when you encounter problems along the
way and when you get to that last part
part advice is only as good as it is
specific to your situation books
podcasts articles and social media
content have great advice but only point
zero zero one percent of it applies to
the exact situation you are in the
millions of bits of information you can
perceive at this very moment of your
life will be vastly different in the
next Second and completely different
from anyone else's experiences and
interpretation of that experience only
once you are in a state of pain struggle
or challenge can you receive the Insight
necessary to transcend to the next level
there is a process to receiving the best
advice that way you don't get mentally
overweight with useless knowledge so
let's break down identity change
self-experimentation and how to ask for
the best advice so that you can actually
get results most people don't need more
advice they need powerful ideas to shape
their world view and decision making
that way they can make better choices
figure it out for themselves and reap
the dopamine that comes from trial and
error the reason you have haven't
achieved a goal is because you aren't
the person that would have achieved that
goal every new goal you set is like
throwing an anchor into the unknown
every new goal you set Demands a new
world view specific skills and beliefs
that form who you are like a video game
there's a reason you aren't level 100
you lack the character development that
turns you into a level 100. in video
games risks aren't real in real life
risks are real but they're often over
conflated with thought all change
requires a change in identity you can't
just ask for advice and expect it to
give you the experience necessary to
reach the level of the goal you've set
for yourself and when was the last time
that you actually took the advice that
you asked for seriously and out of all
of the advice that you've gotten and not
necessarily asked for how much have you
actually listened to because technically
every single thing you read is advice
there's an underlying lesson behind it
but how many things did you learn today
how many lessons did you actually
integrate into your B being today most
advice isn't applicable to your current
level of goals and understanding a level
100 is going to tell you something that
makes sense to them but not to a level
10. people don't realize that the
difference in experience is exponential
in a game each higher level requires
more experience getting from Level 10 to
11 may require 300 experience points
getting from level 99 to 100 would
require a hundred times that amount as a
beginner you don't have to change too
much you can change a few habits set
aside an hour a day and you can replace
your income within a year ish after that
the real self-development Journey Begins
progress starts to slow down like the
Newbie gains phenomenon in the gym you
gain strength and muscle rapidly for
like the first year and then it starts
to become a slow and painful grind and
if you don't back that Pursuit with a
philosophical sense of Mastery and
meaning then you're not going to stick
it out if your identity is not patient
focused on the long term risk tolerant
and a lover of failure you will lose the
first step to changing who you are is
programming your world view your world
view influences the openness of your
perspective the openness of your
perspective influences your perception
of situations your perception of
situations influences the decisions you
make the decisions you make influence
how you act your actions form an
information feedback loop that programs
your identity or sense of self your
identity shapes your worldview and your
worldview shapes your identity so how do
you begin to change who you are by
treating self-education and skill
acquisition as a part of everyday life a
necessity because it baffles me that so
few people actually do this they want to
become a better person they want to
achieve great things they want to be at
peace but they don't realize that their
ability to maneuver toward these
desirable outcomes comes from having the
skill to do so skill is where the Mind
meets life skill is cultivated through
education and practice the difference
between where you are and what you want
is skill not belief not knowledge not
environment not socioeconomic status not
your upbringing all of those are
variables powerful ones that are trumped
by skill it all starts by programming
your mind with the right inputs swap
mindless scrolling for intentional
learning that they're the same thing
just a different way of approaching it a
different intention one has a goal one
doesn't swap video games for building
new projects so the same thing building
projects is a video game in the real
world and now I'm not telling you we'll
talk about this in the next newsletter
I'm not telling you to quit video games
I'm telling you that you need a
foundational habit of learning and
execution in your life and if you don't
have those things then you have no
business doing other things if your
daily life doesn't consist of the things
that not only bring you peace and
progress then just like what are you
doing you're dead swap sleeping in for a
morning walk with a podcast because that
alone just filling your mind with this
information that will expose you to new
potentials for your life is just a very
good thing to have it brings some
clarity and vision into your mornings
learning leads to awareness of
opportunity awareness of opportunity
creates motivation continuous learning
every single day changes your decision
making with time so the second step to
changing who you are is understanding
the pain of identity change changing who
you are is like sculpting a work of art
by the time you turn 18 you're like a
giant Square slab of marble that looks
feels and acts ugly the first decision
is the most painful a commitment to
change to pop an arm out of the marble
against its will so you can start
sculpting away but be careful if you
strike too hard you may destroy the
entire slab you must make small precise
Taps to sculpt your ideal mental
physique every situation that you go
through in life presents a small tap
that can be made you must approach
situations consciously when you feel
that Spike of anxiety because you're
entering something that's unknown you
have to pause and push through the pain
is temporary now step 3 to changing who
you are is understanding that pain is
rather enjoyable and that death gives
life it allows life to happen I was
listening to an older Frank Yang roof
Talk video and he brought up an
interesting way of looking at things
where he's not saying that this is
absolute truth this is just him like
theorizing philosophizing and I thought
it was really interesting where he said
that he first said that Freud says that
we have two drives we have the sex drive
which is creation survival and extending
our lives in The Matrix or the video
game of life and then the Death Drive
which is destruction or absolute Oneness
or returning to Infinity we enjoy pain
but many people hide from that and
inflict more unbearable pain with
surface level pleasurable activities
that keep you comfortable so some seek
out the good pain the one that brings
the meaning and fulfillment or allowed
that allows you to let a part of
yourself die so that another part can
grow so when you're in the gym people
enjoy that pain when they are pushing
through seeing that progress and it
feels good because what you're doing is
you're kind of tearing apart or
destroying muscle cells so that new ones
can grow or they can expand they can
they can send on this like physical
level here but again there's like mental
bodybuilding where you are allowing a
certain part of your identity to die so
that a new one can spring up and emerge
and try and send the old ones so that
you have a higher more holistic self so
the lesson is that you want to kind of
curate an environment like the gym but
in multiple areas of your life to
generate suffering that leads to New
Life and so this is also what like monks
and Mystics are doing when they are
trying to kill the ego or experience ego
death is they are shedding layers of
thought to the point where they are
becoming more at one with what is or
nothingness now we don't have to go too
far down that rabbit hole because we're
that that would change the topic
entirely but I just thought it was
interesting to think about that and to
take that into account is that many
people subject themselves to something
that is much more painful because they
are pursuing pleasure and those that
pursue pain enjoy doing that so now we
have understand that all change requires
a change in identity now we need to
understand the power of
self-experimentation and how it is the
only way to solve your problems for good
observation most smart people I know
when they want to learn something
immediately Google what they want and go
down a rabbit hole everyone else asks
for all the information to be given to
them rarely get a complete answer and
get distracted within five minutes that
is a previous tweet of mine I just
thought it was an interesting
observation self-experimentation is the
only way to solve your problems for good
self-experimentation and self-reliance
go hand in hand they feed into each
other self-experimentation is how you
avoid the dangerous nature of
prescriptions and how-to advice here's a
hypothetical problem not having enough
money to do what you enjoy with your
time so person a follows exactly what a
money Guru says they start investing a
few bucks here and there they play it
safe with their stocks they downgrade
their car so they don't have that
monthly expense and person B they pull
advice from multiple sources to make
decisions for themselves they use how-to
advice but only to discover are
principles that can be integrated into
the pursuit of their goals they study
religiously but do not attach to
business health or social ideologies
that keep them stagnant eventually with
education and effort it clicks and they
know how to make it work I recently saw
a post on Instagram that said something
along the lines of how wealth generation
is slow which I agree with but not as
slow as they made it seem the post was
about how every person that has become a
millionaire under 30 either did it from
an inheritance a high income or a large
income event like crypto and the person
that shared the post mentioned that
they've been budgeting for so long
they're like 35 they've been doing this
for 10 years and they're only like
halfway to a million and I say this for
perspective in some cases I feel like
it's inspiring like I was inspired by
someone when I heard that they were
doing the same thing as me and they hit
their first 100K month and so that's
kind of why I'm saying that this even
though it feels uncomfortable to say it
is that I became a liquid millionaire at
26 6 until I invested 50 of that into a
new business and I've been I've
generated 2.5 to 3.5 million as a
one-person business and now I'm kind of
evolving past that but the thing is is
that like nobody could teach me to do
this and another thing here is that when
you read this advice again where it's
like stop asking for advice the main
lesson of this video is that when you
read advice like this you're like oh
okay all people under 30 only reached it
because of this there's no new way that
I can create there's no new path that I
can forge by doing my own thing there's
no amount of Education or skill that I
can acquire that will allow me to
surpass the average limits that people
impose on themselves and that's exactly
the thing is that you can create a new
path there's so many technological
advancements happening right now in this
very moment that you're in such a
beautiful place to actually start making
progress and do what you want that
wasn't a possibility a few years ago
that's what I'm saying here is that the
advice that that person gave about
people under 30 only hitting a million
dollars because of X Y and Z it's like
yeah you may have been right 10 years
ago but now there are many case studies
arguing against that and that's exactly
the thing is I can't I can't teach you
the exact path because it's highly
individual it's the scientific method
it's trial error Discovery hypothesis
iteration figuring it out for yourself
just by making it a part of your
lifestyle right people are like oh I'm
gonna do this thing for a month and see
if it works out no do it for your entire
 life and see if it works out and
so I can't teach you the exact path but
I can give you like The Meta structure
and the systems and the principles for
what will make it work and that's why I
make these videos that's why I have two
hour writer and digital economics in the
description is because these are
valuable things but what I'm saying the
entire lesson behind this video is is
that you need to take it on yourself to
get results and pull from multiple
perspectives and experiment with things
until it works you can't just blindly
trust me or anyone one else with your
success that's why people go to school
blindly trust the school and then end up
in a life that they hate because they're
the product of that entity they aren't a
product of themselves they didn't create
themselves so let's walk through steps
or a system that allow you to achieve
any goal you want step one is to have a
conscious goal goals provide a frame for
your decision making and I don't want to
hear the regurgitated systems are
greater than goals advice that you got
from James clear you don't have a system
without a goal simple as that you need a
goal that grows into a vision one that
you keep top of mind so you can collect
fuel to the motivation that it gives you
you don't just feel Ultra motivated out
of nowhere you sit with a goal
experience life and generate reasons to
achieve that goal through study and
observation the more energy you invest
in a goal through education and effort
the stronger the gravity of that goal it
begins to pull you toward it
effortlessly because the big picture is
greater than the technical details this
is like an operating principle for my
life and I actually learned this from
Leo gura with actualize.org please go
watch his video 65 principles for the
good life that is like I I watched that
maybe five years ago and I've been
watching it like every year since every
single principle in that book is like
not the book the video is like as you go
through life and you revisit that video
you're like wow like he was right the
entire time you may not understand some
of them at first but this principle big
picture understanding is greater than
technical details is so important and
it's also saying that principles are
greater than tactics but this does not
eliminate the need for technical details
and tactics right none of this stuff is
black and white just like how systems
don't remove the need for goals you will
fail in business if you do not
understand every moving piece of the
business you are trying to build you
will fail in Fitness if you don't have a
holistic understanding of your body
nutrition and training and if you don't
understand the vast negative impacts of
the environment modern foods and stress
you will succumb to them awareness makes
positive decision making much much
easier if you don't have a big picture
understanding of what you wish to
achieve you become susceptible to
ideologies that are by definition of an
ideology untrue in a relative world you
will fall for get rich quick schemes fad
diets and strict advice just to start
over from scratch when you realize they
aren't sustainable when you approach a
goal education and effort go hand in
hand to create understanding so purchase
General books listen to podcasts and
follow social media accounts that dish
out various perspectives pursue your
goal with the time you have and
Implement what you learn action
solidifies true knowledge adjusts your
decision making as you learn you will
suck at first but that's the reality of
any new Endeavor so step three is to
experiment with various techniques
because as you educate towards your goal
right I'm talking your daily education
habit and immersing yourself in the
information that will allow you to
acquire the knowledge to achieve a goal
you will discover techniques to test in
business this looks like writing advice
lead generation advice best business
models and anything else you can find
with a quick Google search this is
easily accessible information that
anyone can and will find and try to do
there's a lot of competition here and I
wish I could give concrete advice with
like explaining how to experiment with
things but it's as simple as just
experimenting with the things that you
learn and trying them out when you learn
something new and the dopamine increases
and you're like oh wow that's actually
really good advice I need to understand
like I need to note this down and try it
then actually try it and try to get
results and once you do that enough with
multiple techniques you start to create
your own where if I go to the gym and I
experiment with high intensity training
like Mike menser high volume training
maybe something completely different
like CrossFit training and then running
and from all of those I pull principles
and do what I enjoy but I understand
that I'm still making progress whether
it be optimal or just enjoyable and I
can start to craft something that really
suits me and gets me the best results
because it's sustainable and it's the
same thing with me trying and failing at
seven different business models I try
all of these things I let truth blur in
the middle of oh okay I need to connect
these dots this is what helps make a
business work and then eventually I
create something that is very unique to
me because I have this amalgamation of
skills and interests and just who I am
that allow me to build something
relatively unique now step four is to
systemize what works as you gain Clarity
on what you want to do there will be
levers that bring you the most results
certain techniques will get you one
percent better results than the next
person that is your Edge because that
one percent compounds I can write 30
minutes every morning and repurpose that
content for all platforms this is what
with time I realized is what brought in
the followers and sales it's content for
any business model not just like me
talking to you now for the businesses
that I'm going to start in the future
and the businesses that I've had in the
past I saw writing as a lever for
traffic I saw a newsletter as an
infinitely repurposable piece of content
it took me a long time at first because
I wasn't efficient I didn't have the
skill under my belt so it took longer
but now it takes me about 30 minutes to
an hour in the morning that's what I do
and the things that I do now won't look
the same as a absolute beginner because
on something like social media you're
gonna have to reply like a madman to get
eyes on your account and content
practice writing content that gets
shared and brings in followers build a
product or service that solves your own
problems and start to write longer form
content to build trust and make sales
because it's like I say oh I write 30
minutes every morning but if you don't
have a product that allows you to do
that then it doesn't really make sense
you're gonna have to think big picture
about your business and realize okay I'm
gonna have to dedicate time to this and
then once that's automated then I start
dedicating time to this more and then
eventually you create this system that
allows you to sustain everything and so
this video wasn't the most actionable
but I feel like it's very important it's
it's again to frame your decision making
because for every piece of actionable
advice the thing that people just drool
over there's a hundred thousand people
that don't see any results with it so
stop masturbating mentally to all
actionable advice and no fluff I'll give
me the pure value don't leave the fluff
in there just take it all out you don't
understand what the fluff is and why
it's important and you only perceive it
as fluff is because well what one person
perceives as fluff other person
perceives as just pure value and so
there's a reason behind that and you
ignoring that or just being like Oh the
fluff of this video or this book is so
like why is it even there when that's
what changes the lives don't be an
advice junkie do what you want and get
better at doing it through education and
effort have a great rest of your week
