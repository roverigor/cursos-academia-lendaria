alrighty my friends fasten your seat
belts because this one has been a long
time coming and for those that read the
newsletter before this on the same topic
uh understand that it is possibly better
than sex so if you're ready for a video
that is better than sex
Buckle in one of my favorite failed
businesses was creating digital art with
Photoshop and you can see here that this
is one of my uh favorite pieces I have a
bunch and if you want to see any of them
you can scroll all the way to the bottom
of my Instagram and this was the first
time I realized the power of social
media in building a business but I
didn't realize that I was building a
business at that time and so I emulated
how larger accounts grew their following
by tagging Community pages that share
digital art creating the best Composites
I could so they would get shared and
remixing photographers images in hopes
that they would share my content and
this is kind of like mentioning a large
account and a Twitter thread so that
they retweet to Their audience or it's
like tagging someone in an Instagram
post based on an idea that they gave you
so that they share it to their story and
then boom you have eyes on your content
and you're gaining a following that's
one of many like social media growth
strategies and so this was almost five
years ago now it was in 2017 so I think
six five so bad at math but one yeah but
that's when I first grew to 2500
followers on Instagram and so after
locking myself in my room learning how
to use Photoshop forgetting to eat most
days when I'm sitting there creating
these little pieces of art I gave up I
love to create but I had no idea how to
monetize and my art was valuable but it
wasn't valuable enough to demand payment
other people didn't perceive it that
valuable and so I realized that I
couldn't sustain that lifestyle as an
artist and I felt like I had to learn a
more profitable skill in order to start
freelancing with that and then uh slowly
build up from there and just have art as
a side hobby but of course I was an
idiot and if I could go back and change
things I would and if I knew what I knew
now I would probably still be doing that
photoshop art but I do love writing a
bit more now I believe the universe
conspired in my favor and I ended up
finding something that I truly enjoy but
if I were to go back I would continue
growing and realize my audience as a
traffic source and I'd create a product
or service to send that traffic to so
courses and coaching in this case and
someone who did this well that I didn't
really see anything I bought a course
from this guy called visuals of Julius
and that's how I learned to do this and
so it didn't register in my mind like
hey I bought this course why don't I
create my own just show people how I
made the favorite piece that I showed
you in the screenshot earlier and that
alone would probably build a sustainable
income for myself just by promoting that
through my audience that is continuing
to grow and then the next thing is that
I'd learned copywriting marketing and
offer creation to position my product in
the market
then I would partner with personal
development creators to visualize their
best ideas and become an authority in
that space so in other words I do
everything that we talk about in the one
person business model series and so the
skills that I learned through these
failed business models like Photoshop
and others they can they created who I
am today so I use Photoshop in my own
thumbnails I create my own thumbnails I
create my own Instagram designs I create
my own website I create everything
because I had I learned that skill and
tried to create a business out of it
until I finally stumbled upon being a
Creator and so I started from that point
of Leverage but aside from all of those
skills there is one skill that is
responsible for 95 percent of the
results of my business success and it
has contributed the most to my brand
sales content and just Revenue growth
over the past three to four years and
that's what we're going to talk about
today and I call this skill value
creation do what you love but study
psychology marketing and sales so you
don't become a starving artist every
money making skill that people tell you
to learn is linked with universal
patterns and human psychology and yes
I'm getting spiritual here Universal
patterns that's what everything is built
from the essence of being is how
knowledge was constructed knowledge is
second order being and spirit is first
order or in other words experience we
have to experience something before we
can label it turn it into knowledge
share that knowledge and then everyone
operate and communicate to form a social
Fabric and civilization and so if skills
aren't linked with human psychology or
Universal patterns then they don't make
money and if they don't make money like
Photoshop art for example which isn't
inherently persuasive or it doesn't
necessarily communicate the value of
something that people desire in order to
give you money in the form of value that
you want then you need to stack skills
you need to stack the skill that we're
going to talk about in this video onto
the other skills that you have right now
that you want to monetize and so at the
base of all human behavior including
people pulling out their credit cards to
pay you are three things the first is
survival which is the desire to
replicate information in your genes and
Consciousness both physical and mental
second is evolution so the desire to
outpace destruction through creation and
the third is transformation so the
desire to achieve a higher quality of
experience these are all fairly similar
and we're going to consider them
synonymous for the rest of this video so
storytelling Games music architecture
anything that is created also mimics
these patterns because as I said
everything that we create is that of
being from reality and so you can
observe and dissect these patterns in
these things we're getting a bit like
off topic here but I just want to paint
this picture
and show you how deep this actually runs
so in the simplest way that I can
explain it and package it up into a
framework this whole human behavior
um framework is purpose path priority so
the first is purpose and behavior change
starts with becoming aware of a problem
and then a goal revealing itself in
order to overcome it so a transformation
goal equals purpose purpose equals
desire desire equals how problems come
into existence like how a story opens a
curiosity Loop by implying or directly
stating that there is a problem that
hooks your attention in order to read
through the story and follow the highs
and lows that also reflect in something
like architecture when you're creating
the grooves or designing an image or
something like that and that hooks your
attention to read and figure out what
the transformation is and what the
solution was to create that
transformation that people want in their
lives that's what engages our mind with
reality and how we communicate with
others and so it's also how people start
a landing page or a YouTube video or any
form of content there's always a problem
that is implied state did and then
Amplified in order to hook and grab
attention to lead into a solution and it
reflects in your personal life as well
where once you become very aware of a
problem in your life and how it is
spreading and impacting other areas of
your life you get fed up with it once
you become conscious of it and then you
work to overcome it to create a
transformation for yourself so by the
lesson here is by shining a light and
making people aware of their problems
you create purpose not only in yourself
but in others so the second thing is the
path so when a problem is identified or
someone is made aware of the problem
they need Clarity on how to overcome it
right because if you just make someone
aware of a problem then then they don't
know how to overcome it or it's not that
important to them or there is no Clarity
which we've talked about many times
before where you need to order
Consciousness through structured
information or else chaos ensues
overwhelm overthinking anxiety we don't
want to cause that in our customers so
we create a path that we can illustrate
in our content or our products in order
to bridge the gap between the problem
they're facing and the transformation
that they're trying to acquire and so
the third thing is priority because all
of this problems are determined by
perceived importance right one a problem
to your friend may not be a problem to
you or it may not be an important
problem to you and so this is why it's
important that we frame what we're
talking about here from the right
perspective because if a problem isn't
important to an individual or you are
writing content or creating a product or
something else and the problem just
doesn't register with them it's not
important it doesn't hit because you
aren't speaking their language or like
you're just off like you didn't do your
market research then it's not going to
catch their attention and you aren't
going to make any money and so humans
perceive problems from the lens of their
identity this is why it's important that
you target a customer Avatar or create
one and this is also why I
like to take the route of turning
yourself into the customer Avatar and
marketing to your past self and
attracting the people that are like you
see the most profitable niches you video
because that's a lot easier to do and
it's more fulfilling to do because you
already have it all in your head you
don't have to work with someone you hate
in order to make money you just Market
towards your past self and the identity
associated with that because you know
that perspective best because identity
and perspective are very closely linked
and so your perspective on things that
forms a foundation of your content your
writing your products whatever you
create and the people you attract to
create a shared perspective and
perspective is very goal and vision
oriented so you are leading people
towards a goal or vision and attracting
people to that through your content and
therefore able to Market your products
better towards them and then it just
click creates a holistic business model
that you truly enjoy
doing because think about it like if if
you're trying to make a gamer aware of a
problem like a health problem and they
already have all of these preset beliefs
and they're identified with being a
gamer and drinking Mountain Dew or G
Fuel and all this other stuff and you're
coming in and you're like hey you're
unhealthy they're just gonna be like Oh
no you're an idiot uh like you know how
gamers are they're very like
closed-minded and frankly idiotic in
most cases there are some open-minded
ones but you know what I'm talking about
you have to position the product in a
very specific way to speak to that
person you have to understand your
customer is what I'm saying here and so
by the way you can this is the same
framework that I used in uh how to take
back control of your life that video
because it's the same it's the same
thing for changing your life and
changing other people's lives this is a
universal principle of value creation
for yourself and others okay so now
let's talk about the value creation
framework because we just talked about
purpose path priority and we have a lot
to go over here this is going to be a
long video but it will be worth your
time so in the things that we list our
off going on here there's going to be
like eight things that we list off treat
all of these as marketing Firepower or
marketing Legos these are pieces that
you can use in your landing pages sales
Pages opt-in Pages website content brand
bio everything because you have to
capture hold and deliver value on the
attention you captured and so these that
we're going to talk about are these
steps from turning dirt into gold
because marketing is perception no it
doesn't matter how good your product is
it matters about how important and
valuable that product is perceived by
other people and so these eight steps
are what is going to help you illustrate
that perceived value and so these are
the steps that when I applied them to my
business and kind of had that aha moment
this is what I need to do this is what
brought my business to 1 million plus
dollars closing in on 2 million in
Revenue in the past three years and so
we're going to assume that you are
learning this in order to create an
offer or create a better offer or
promote a product that you already have
if you don't check out my previous one
person business model video in and of
itself the series and the best business
model to make 1 million in like 2023 or
something like that and the you have a
100 000 product in your head I've made a
ton of videos on these so the first
thing that you need to understand is
levels of awareness you need to
understand the problem the problem is
the first thing that we're trying to
identify here and you have to be able to
illustrate that problem to the people
that you're talking to in your content
and product and so also note that these
overlap with the nine stages of ego
development watch the video by
actualize.org if you want to understand
yourself better and it also overlaps
with spiral Dynamics the spiral Dynamics
stage stages in philosophy so the first
level of awareness is unaware they're
unaware of a problem in their life and
this is where most viral YouTube videos
uh Instagram all content this is how
people are positioning it is from the
unaware stage of people problems so you
want to write and speak to people and
show them how a problem is impacting
their life to make them aware of it so
if you're trying to help someone get fit
you may point out that a lack of proper
nutrition or a certain way of eating is
contributing to the grogginess or
feeling tired or low energy that they
are feeling so a tweet that I would
write you're always tired because you
stuff your face with hot pockets
ubereats and foods that lead to nutrient
deficiency so it's a bit harsh but yes
that's my style so level two the second
level of awareness is that your readers
are aware of their problem but they may
not understand it or they aren't aware
of a potential solution so they aren't
acting on it so a post I would write
here is if you're tired all the time
weigh yourself every morning eat your
body weight and protein drink water
until you pee clear walk 10 000 steps a
day thank me later when you feel so good
that you hate the thought of ruining
that feeling with junk food and so in
long form content you can both
illustrate the problem and provide a
solution you can walk through multiple
stated levels of awareness here but with
short form content like a tweet or a
short or a real or just an Instagram
post or something like that you're
usually going to be targeting level one
through three in order to uh generate
the most attention and capture the most
of your audience because 95 of the
market are beginners so with short form
content you don't want to be too high
level or clever save that for long form
so that you can present an entire
argument introduce them to the problem
make them aware of it provide a solution
and help encourage them to act so level
three is solution aware they're aware of
a solution or your solution and you just
need to put it in front of them or you
need to put the solution in front of
them like give them steps to overcome
their problem and so level four is
product aware where people are aware of
your solution and other Solutions on the
market and so your job in this level of
awareness and understand that everyone
is in a specific level of awareness at
any time when they are interacting
online right whether it be when they go
to your profile so when they're looking
at your bio which level of awareness are
you targeting is it too high level or is
it too broad and then when they click on
your website what's the level of
awareness they're at now when they go
through your emails what level of
awareness are they at when they're
looking at your content which level of
awareness are you targeting and so in
this stage your job is to present a
reason or an argument for why your
solution is better than those on the
market and benefits Rich language is key
here so here's a post I would write why
you should start intermittent fasting
morning focus is insane you don't have
to plan morning food lunch and dinner
can be massive meals and I could finish
this but you get the point and this is
already getting very long but you can
see how intermittent fasting is more of
a novel solution for a specific person
that is has a specific lifestyle where
you can provide the benefits to that and
how it will impact your energy levels
and everything like that and so level
five is that they are most aware of
their problems and they're aware of the
solutions on the market and they're
aware of your solution they're sold on
it all they need is some form of an
incentive or to have a promotion placed
in front of them or it's like that final
barrier where they're tipped over the
top and so you can use like a limited
time sale or some other scarcity tactic
here but you just
be careful with those so we got through
the levels of awareness that was like
the longest one of these but the second
is positioning so here are the eight
human desires which we will talk about
but this is a cool little graphic that
you can
look at so now that we understand the
levels of awareness we can begin to
craft a persuasive message and so by the
way this is all this a lot of this is
from digital economics my master class
for productizing yourself so if you want
a notion template to actually walk you
through crafting this content product
promotions and all that stuff and
creating your brand then I would check
that out links in the description and so
we've discussed the Eternal markets many
times before which are health wealth
relationships but we're going to take it
a bit deeper here so there are eight
human desires that are impossible to
ignore and all of your content all of
your copywriting all of your sales Pages
landing pages and whatever must be
framed from a problem residing in one of
these right you have to find a problem
and then attack it from a specific angle
this is positioning or creating an angle
in marketing so this is how you start or
frame what you are going to write or
speak about so the eight human desires
are Survival Life enjoyment Freedom From
Fear sexual companionship comfort and
Clarity perceived status safety of
community and social acceptance so you
want to educate people on the problems
they are facing in one of these domains
relating to your product or service so
if you're selling like a make money
online product you can take the status
angle and be like oh I live this fancy
lifestyle and I have this Rich car and
then people want that so you catch
attention and then you can create an
argument around that once it's framed
from that it's much easier to write or
you can go from the life enjoyment angle
which is a bit less scammy where if I'm
teaching a skill I can be like here's
how the quality of your life is going to
increase
from learning this skill and that's how
you start or frame your persuasive
message and so I would encourage you to
think about the product or service that
either you sell or is being sold like
you can think of my products if you
don't have a product so two hour writer
me teaching writing and content and
branding how can you frame that through
Survival Life enjoyment like survival
you need skills in order to survive in
the modern world you need high value
skills in order to make a specific
income and then if you wanted to you
could even frame this under like sexual
companionship where it's like here's
what you do you have to learn how to
write you need to build a brand for
yourself and then you from that place of
social Authority with a lot of followers
get to DM the man or woman that you want
and have that
leverage over the people that don't have
many followers you could do it that way
it's not the smartest way to like write
your copy but you could and so the thing
with this is is notice how every single
person's Niche is self-improvement or
self-actualization right that's the
broad Niche where you can break it down
into the topics that you talk about
within the health wealth relationships
markets but I'm just saying this to
prove that my theory still holds true
which is to solve your own problems
document the solution online and improve
others to raise the collective
Consciousness it still holds true so now
on to number three which is the big
problem so now we have levels of
awareness and positioning and now we
need from those two we need to identify
a big problem that we can start our
writing speaking or Creations office or
content products promotions whatever it
may be what is the big problem from the
level of awareness that people are
sitting in so dependent on where you're
writing the content and then whatever
angle you choose to go from so like life
enjoyment what's a big problem relating
to that so from Level 1 the unaware
stage and the perceived status angle I
can identify a big problem like not
having a six-figure income and then I
can agitate that problem as to why a
six-figure income is impacting the rest
of their life it's impacting how like
who they can actually get a date with
it's impacting what kind of location
they can live in it's impacting possibly
their ability to pay their bills
comfortably that also crosses over with
the survival angle and how the world
naturally lacks a level of respect for
them I don't know if this is true I'm
just we're painting a picture here and
so is this shallow yes welcome to human
life depth comes after you solve the
shallow problems in your life and others
you have to raise people beyond the
surface level problems that they have
but you can't just let them skip that
they have to solve those things in order
to reach that place of depth because
frankly nobody cares about mindfulness
or existentialism or spirituality when
they can't pay their bills like if if
the only thing if the entirety of their
mind is narrow stressed and focused on
paying the bills and trying to get a
girlfriend like like 18 year olds do and
all of this other you have to work
them beyond that and you can't just
ignore the shallow superficial because
these are the stages of development that
you have to raise people up right your
ego has to develop now the fourth thing
after the big problem see this is where
we're getting into purpose path priority
we have the problem and now we need the
path or the solution so the fourth thing
is a unique mechanism because you need a
solution that stands out from everyone
else's and again this is why I always
recommend figuring it out for yourself
right solving your own problems in a
unique way and going through the trial
and error that makes you an expert on
that problem that you are solving so
that you can help others people solve it
from a unique way because if you just
take exactly what someone else is doing
I'm not saying not to do this but if you
just take exactly what someone else is
doing and Patch it up as your own not
only are you not going to be able to
teach that but it's not not going to be
unique in any way you don't have the
experience to make it unique so you take
from multiple sources in order to solve
your own problems and then through
experience you can come back and reflect
and create a solution on your own and so
this is like how grego Gallagher
combined uh intermittent fasting and
reverse pyramid training to create a
training program that fit his lifestyle
perfectly and he understood like the
back of his hand and how it impacted his
life so that he could Market it in a
great way and he definitely took the
perceived status angle by at the
beginning he was like flexing uh
Lamborghinis and hot women and all this
stuff but he's going down different
angles now and that's just how things
work he changed my life for the better
and I didn't really care about the
Lambos or that but I like his training
philosophy and so you have to think
about how you would solve the big
problem step by step and then create
that on your own so I like to think
about it from the lens of a book right
the book If you were to have an end goal
problem at the start how would you fill
that in what are the chapters and the
sub chapters and then how are you going
to write and deliver on that so after
that then you slap a compelling name on
it and my two hour writer or my two hour
content ecosystem inside the two hour
writer is an example of that you can
understand everything that we're talking
about here by just looking at that
landing page now the fifth thing is
bullet spray benefits so if you've ever
started copywriting you're going you're
starting to see where I'm getting at
with all of this and how a persuasive
argument is formed but once you have the
big problem and the unique mechanism to
overcome it for that is your product or
service then you need to help people
understand why it is applicable and
relatable to their lives and how it will
benefit their lives so my favorite way
to do this is by bullet points right
just bullet points benefits bullet spray
them with it because when you give a
bullet point list rather than just like
not making it very clear as to how it's
going to benefit their life it's like a
list tweet right a list tweet is like
five steps to a better life go on a walk
one two three four five right five
bullet points and when people read
through that they may not agree with the
first one they may not resonate with the
second one but the third bullet point
they're like oh yeah I love that I'm
gonna like and retweet and so it's the
same thing with the bullet spray
benefits you list as many compelling
benefits as there are or as you can and
just one of those may be the reason that
they buy so now the sixth step in value
creation is proof so a lot of people
talk about social proof or testimonials
and those are important but many people
don't have those at the beginning and
when you don't have those of course it
should be your full-time job to get
those from the people that buy your
products or services but a lot of people
get afraid to sell something because
they don't have social proof or
testimonials but what you do have is
personal experience and you have the
personal experience of others in the
form of statistics and anecdotes that
you can research and find online to form
your compelling argument in your writing
and so this is why I start 90 of my
videos or newsletters with a personal
experience that illustrates the problem
and then I can talk about my story and
how I overcame it right everyone's first
product can just be something that they
created for themselves and they talk
about their personal experience the
problem they're facing and how they
overcame it and then once they get
testimonials they can just add that to
the landing page and you're fine you may
make less sales at the beginning
and that's fine it's all a progression
so the seventh step to Value creation is
the big idea and what a big idea is is
it's pretty much like I like to think of
it as a one sentence summary of
everything else that we just listed so
it's a one sentence summary that
illustrates the value of what you're
providing so most the most popular
quotes are very big Ideas the content
that you like so much are very big Ideas
the parts of this video that caught your
attention and caused excitement in you
are big Ideas right I talk about how I
hunt for Big Ideas in the last video
that got abysmal views for some reason
that sucks because it's why do all of
the most important and most valuable
videos just like not get many views if
you want something go watch the last
video which is on reading how to stop
forgetting everything you read watch it
all the way through I probably I promise
it'll change everything you think about
content creation and reading in general
because Big Ideas are found by hunting
for them and making them your own right
all of the all of my newsletters and
everything I keep a database of Big
Ideas when I'm scrolling Twitter and a
tweet sticks out to me I copy paste that
into notion when I read something in a
book I highlight it and the notion
connected to read wise uploads it to
notion and I can refer to those at any
time right you need a place to capture
ideas because then you use those ideas
and sprinkle them throughout your
newsletters and landing pages and so
some examples of like common Big Ideas
are that Bitcoin is the digital currency
of the future or that Uber is the modern
taxi service or that chat GPT is
everything and so this can overlap with
or be any of the points you listed out
recently like the big problem or the
unique mechanism's name and then the
eighth and final step of value creation
is a risk reversal and end result right
because you have the problem that is
positioned towards a specific level of
awareness and then you have the unique
mechanism or your solution for
overcoming it you have the benefits
associated with that but what's the
clear outcome and what's on the line if
they do not reach that clear outcome
right what is the desirable end result
here and so a compelling risk reversal
is going it's what's going to be it's
what's going to help you close the most
deals at the beginning of your journey
and most people opt for like a money
back guarantee which is cool but you can
spice it up quite a bit you can get
creative with it and really do anything
you want if you play back and forth
between like the the desirable end
result and the risk reversal associated
with that so an example when selling
something like a dating product is that
if you don't land five dates in 60 days
then you we refund your money right
that's a desirable end result five dates
and a risk reversal if you don't get
those five days in 60 days then you get
your money back why would you not buy
that and that puts pressure on you to
deliver especially if you're a beginner
it doesn't matter if you haven't gotten
those results before that's why you're
refunding their money if you can't
achieve it and that's what puts pressure
that's what makes you actually act
that's what makes you try to deliver and
through trying your hardest to make that
work you realize what's actually
possible and then the next time you come
back from a better iteration and then it
slowly gets better and better with time
and of course here you can add caveats
to your risk reversal in your landing
page or whatever it may be right you can
say
we will give you your money back but
only if you execute and can prove that
you executed on every single action here
so then you think about it and it's like
okay well maybe they have to get their
number and then land the five dates
right and so then they can send you
screenshots of the text that they're
sending back and forth between them and
then if your methods just didn't work
out then they refund the money but if
they actually execute on everything you
said then it's almost impossible for
them to fail so it's a win-win for both
people where the pressure is put on you
to deliver and the pressure is put on
them to actually act on what they
purchase because most people don't do
that so now that was it but I want to
reiterate that you want to treat each of
those eight things as marketing Legos in
everything you use and you have to
practice at every single moment to get
good at this watching this video is not
enough watching anything or reading
anything is not enough you have to start
a project encounter to real world
problems and let reality teach you what
watching this video can't because there
are thousands thousands thousands
thousands of minor nuances that you will
pick up consciously and subconsciously
as you are making progress and none of
those nuances can be Illustrated to you
in a course content or like a book so
here are a few places where you can use
these pieces for your value creation the
first is social media posts so in long
form content it usually follows the
format of illustrating a problem
agitating the problem giving context and
raising them up the level of awareness
right so making them aware of the
problem in their life and how it's
impacting their life so that's agitating
the problem and then giving actionable
steps to overcome that problem so you're
giving them a solution so they're
solution aware and then incorporate a
bullet spray list of benefits or just
incorporate benefits so that they are
encouraged to implement it into their
life and then use the big idea of all of
that as your headline title or whatever
ever it may be right the one person
business is not only a unique mechanism
but it is a big idea that are my most
popular YouTube videos so long form
content can walk people through all
levels of awareness right so for
engagement you usually Target one
through three so you start with a
problem that people are unaware of you
make them aware of it you agitate the
problem or make them aware of it more
and then you provide a solution and
that's pretty much it it's usually the
problem solution that's content but for
sales right you usually go from two to
five so you're targeting a more specific
person that is aware of their problem
you illustrate why that problem is uh
impacting their life and why they need
to change their life and then slowly
through the end you introduce them to
your product and provide an incentive
for them to act on it and so short form
content is kind of it's limited to less
it's usually limited to one or two or
three of these things at a time where
like the big idea can be a tweet in
itself or the problem and the big idea
or the problem and unique mechanism or
the steps
that forms like a tweet an Instagram
post a real whatever it may be and so
that was just social media content but
this can also obviously be used on a
landing page or sales page and so the
best way to practice this is to take
this video with those eight steps and
pair it with copywriting Frameworks like
Pastor which is problem amplify story
testimony offer and response you can
just Google these things or Ada which is
a interest attention interest desire and
action or pass which is problem amplify
and solution and then you get better
with time by using those Frameworks and
structuring all of the eight things that
we talked about here within those
Frameworks and so on a landing page or
sales page for the headline and sub
headline or everything above the fold
right the very first part of the website
is where you're trying to fit and
summarize all eight of these value
creation steps and so the next place you
can use them is a course curriculum
right because you don't want to just
stop being persuasive once you get into
a course you want people to you want to
capture tension in each module you want
to walk them through give them steps to
overcoming the problem that is presented
in each section and that's how you get
them to act right and then the last
place is just an everyday conversation
right when you're talking to someone
practice this start with a problem that
you're facing and then let the
conversation Carry On from there that's
how you articulate your points this is
articulation more than it is just
marketing and so that is it for this
video this is extremely powerful
if you actually use what we talked about
here and practice it that's the key so
let me know what you thought of this let
me know if you thought it was valuable
