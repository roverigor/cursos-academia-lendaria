wake up hit snooze four times stare at
your phone roll out of bed make coffee
sit in traffic eight hours of
unfulfilling work sit in traffic again
argue with your significant other walk
the pet watch TV pass out repeat this
should scare the out of you yet
this is the state of 95 percent of the
population even those that are putting
effort into escaping this on a daily
basis I did everything in my power to
avoid a nine to five from the ages of I
would say 16 to 22 I was just obsessed
with building different businesses and
learning different skills to try and
Escape that reality that I had in my
mind that was my anti-vision it was the
bane of my existence to have a nine to
five job why because I saw how people
lived right if you just observe societal
patterns right You observe Society you
can see and discern what is good from
bad in terms of your daily the actions
what are going to lead to a good life
and what are going to lead to a bad life
you can go to the grocery store and see
what someone is putting into their
basket and realize okay that's how you
end up like this person not in a
judgmental way you have to be able to
make decisions through observation and
then you become less mindless when you
put things into your own cart do I want
to end up like that no I want to end up
like this and so when I did get a job
the list at the beginning became my
default state of living everything
revolved around my work whether I wanted
it to or not right and now with
entrepreneurship what we're going to
talk about in this video and how I
believe it should be is that work should
revolve around your ideal lifestyle and
anything that compromises that then
entrepreneurship isn't worth it at that
point and I'm going to argue why
entrepreneurship is the only route to
take so over the past three or four
years on my Creator Journey I've noticed
a few things entrepreneurship is the
only path for long-term logical thinkers
you humans have been removing labor work
since the beginning of time and we are
on the horizon of complete removal the
Creator economy is the new economy if
you don't have a personal brand you lose
like the Black Mirror episode nosedive
but in a good way sensible people get
paid for doing what they enjoy doing
shout out Alan Watts for being way ahead
of his time the future belongs to the
self-improver the person that takes
responsibility for their life and
becomes a Fountainhead of value and when
done in public it's almost impossible
not to get paid so I was scrolling on
YouTube the other day and it post caught
my attention right so the the caption of
the post was what is one thing that you
find overrated but most people love and
there were comments about travel and
other things but the one that caught my
attention was this I'm just going to
read the first comment but it says
entrepreneurship don't get me wrong I
think it's great if you have the skills
to go that route but at the end of the
day work is work that red flag man red
flag I'm sick of being told I'm a wage
slave for 2 choosing to work a nine to
five most of these quote unquote
entrepreneurs are really just unemployed
that's very loaded very assumptive I get
where you're coming from I really do
like it's easy to make that assumption
when you're online and seeing these
people like flexing big numbers but man
there's a lot there's a lot here and the
comments on this if you want to pause
and look at these like I hate social
media comments I hate getting trapped in
them but our brain loves it and I won't
lie this irked me at first right it my
my defense systems immediately started
going off I'm like no you're wrong
you're wrong you're wrong and I was
creating objections in my mind so I
decided why not just turn this into an
actual video because it made me question
like how can people not realize that
entrepreneurship is the only path in
life where you can have full control
over your lifestyle and that full
control of your lifestyle is the only
way to have full control over your
enjoyment but yeah you can enjoy work
and and whatever these people say about
it but it's like if you don't realize
that by not using the humans unique
ability ability to create that's what we
do we have the gift of God within us to
create that's what you're supposed to do
that's what feels amazing and
when you're creating for someone else
with a purpose that is assigned to you
there's so much scientific literature
and just everything that talks about how
the psyche is wired that all point to
entrepreneurship and the thing is is
it's increasingly becoming more
difficult to find the perfect gig and
even the perfect gig isn't perfect
there's going to be something that you
hate about it and because it isn't yours
because you aren't an entrepreneur you
won't be able to change it and you won't
be able to leverage all of the intrinsic
drivers that make life good like
curiosity passion purpose autonomy and
Mastery those are the intrinsic drivers
not extrinsic not something being
assigned to you and so a few of these
comments hit me here's I'm just going to
list off the objections people hate what
they don't understand the people that
comment on these things have not been
entrepreneurs they don't understand it
they don't understand the nuances of the
brain that you pick up through daily
experience you only see online me
included you only see maybe one percent
or less of my life like as much as I
love the whole authenticity thing of the
Creator economy and that people are
pushing that but you guys don't know me
you don't know me at all and so you see
five percent of someone's business or
less than one percent of someone's life
and think that's enough to draw
conclusions as to what you should do
without experience we talked about
observing Society earlier so you can
correct your own actions but if you're
using it to just reinforce what you've
been told to do and then justify it as
oh I chose to do this when you're tied
to money or else you would quit and not
do it in essence they think
entrepreneurship is overrated because
they aren't entrepreneurs I'm tired of
being called a wage slave I'm sorry but
your your feelings aren't reality if you
got let go and you could not pay the
bills then you are by definition a
modern slave and and the thing here is
is that slave doesn't have to be good or
bad we all have a collective notion of
oh yeah slavery was very bad and I would
argue that all of us agree that slavery
in the past was bad but I will also
argue that we will look back on the
Industrial Age and realize that it
slavery was the norm and that is what AI
is coming in to fix and so if you're
forced to work for your survival you you
don't have a choice you're making
choices in alignment with the
unconscious and subconscious survival
goals that you have in this life and not
only that but most people are
unconscious of what goes on behind the
scenes of their company they don't care
to look beyond the string of tasks that
they have to do on a daily basis and so
they can go home and sit on the couch
and watch TV they aren't aware of the
exploitation of these massive companies
hiring or paying pennies to Third World
sweatshops and literally contributing to
a much worse form of slavery and so when
you become conscious of this and you
continue to do it and don't think
entrepreneurship is the only way out
then like that's a terrible thing and of
course this isn't in all cases this
isn't at all companies but if you're
working for a mega Corporation or like a
huge chain like McDonald's there's stuff
going on behind the scenes that you
don't know about and you're serving
people the worst food for the
Health in the world like what are you
doing and of course you can't control
this at the start right that's the
entire self-actualization Journey or
creating freedom for yourself you have
to help create a better life you have to
help create a better world that's what
makes life meaningful what's wrong with
me offering my skills to already
developed corporations nothing but why
not develop skills that fit your own
unique interests the skills that you
enjoy using and then reach out to these
bigger corporations and work as a
freelancer and not have a cap on your
income so you can make 10 times more
than you would working for the
corporation but you don't want to take
the little bit amount of time that it
takes to get there you'd rather apply to
a job from something that you already
learned in the social fabric the the
social Matrix of people teaching you
okay you're are going to school so you
can get trained in this job because this
job is paying the school to teach this
curriculum and Wikipedia is flooded with
uh information that the school you're
learning from the school itself it's all
 up and when you do that you
aren't when you're a freelancer or you
actually treat yourself as a business
then you aren't a slave to productivity
metrics and all the other things you
hate at your job you gain control over
your lifestyle and you can change things
however you want that's another thing
like when people actually try
entrepreneurship and don't like it it's
because they don't realize like hey you
get to create your own job you don't
have to do it like all other
entrepreneurs do and one of the comments
said you're paying a man fifty dollars
to escape the matrix that's not how it
works actually it is how it works that's
how I escape the matrix I'm not a fan of
Tate or like his views but he's teaching
time tested marketable skills there's
only so much you can learn about that I
don't have his product but I can assume
what's in it and for fifty dollars it's
a great thing in my eyes it's
better than spending forty thousand
dollars on a degree that can only make
you so much money right you have to
learn the skills that allow you to play
Infinite games and make an infinite
income making money is a skill that can
be practiced and cultivated but only
through entrepreneurship because that's
how you actually try to make the money
you aren't making the money you are
being given the money in a corporate job
you aren't actually making the money you
aren't making that transaction because
your boss is making as much money as he
wants entrepreneurs don't go back to a
nine to five that's one of my things is
like I've never seen an entrepreneur go
back to a nine to five I've only seen
nine to fivers leave to become an
entrepreneur you're busy all the time no
you aren't the the stigma of
entrepreneurs being busy is silly like I
don't think it's a thing I work four
hours a day maybe minimum maximum
sometimes more sometimes less watch my
video the four hour workday you're in
control of your lifestyle I can work as
much as I want if I build the
things that allow me to work how much I
want all right two last things because
this part is getting really long and I'm
just like I'm sticking on this too much
but one thing is the psychology of
Entrepreneurship right we have the
psyche of our ancestors the external
world has changed a lot but our
ancestors were metaphorically
entrepreneurs right entrepreneurship is
a new form of just contributing to the
world contributing to a community
providing value in exchange for another
form of value our ancestors had their
communities or their tribes where they
had a specific value skill that they
could offer like cooking cleaning taking
care of the kids whatever and they serve
their communities right if you're just
doing the same repetitive task day in
day out then life loses its weight you
have to have purpose and
Entrepreneurship and modern business is
the vessel for purpose and so last thing
is that work consumes about 25 of your
life if you do the math it's about 25
would you rather spend 25 of your life
making new discoveries in the unknown
and actually having some meaning in your
life or just
predictable same thing day in day out
never really breaking out yeah you can
go travel here and there but not for
long because you have to go back and all
this other stuff that's not in your
control the real AI Singularity if it
happens at all it's going to look like a
doomsday scenario like in a Sci-Fi Story
the real way it happens and this is
probably inevitable is a gradual erosion
of human labor so this is a tweet from
zero HP Lovecraft I see of some of his
stuff occasionally I think he's very
good I haven't followed him yet I don't
know why but
interesting posts so we're gonna talk
about Ai and what the Creator's role is
in it or what the modern Workforce is
going to look like and I like to start
off with like predictions from the past
so Aristotle condemned manual labor as
harmful to the body and soul the ancient
Greeks saw work as a necessary part of
life but only as a means to Leisure
creativity and contemplation as they
considered those the key to happiness
and they needed that balance that
contrast because the rest the Leisure it
can't exist without work it holds no
meaning and so manual work isn't always
bad right labor work isn't bad like none
of these things are quote unquote bad
it's all subjective it's all based on a
specific perspective but if you're just
manually robotically animalistically
completing tasks day and day and day and
day after day you aren't a human for
that amount of your life you're a robot
or an automation or an animal right
you're a robot you're if you are a robot
you're going to be replaced by robots so
with Automation and Ai and all the
Doomsday perspectives around that I only
see good coming from it because a
decline in labor work means an incline
in creative and knowledge work for
people that choose to continue working
right I've heard perspectives of like
Universal basic income or other things
like AI where it's like oh people will
naturally self-actualize well it's
either that they'll have more time to
self-actualize or they'll have more time
to destroy their lives and so the people
that want to take control of their lives
preferably you watching this video you
can leverage this point in time for just
that right people are considering Ubi
Universal basic income and AI is just
coming in to kind of do that for people
but allow people to choose how they make
money I like the AI route a lot more
because it forces people to get creative
if they want to survive it forces people
to be human and so from McKenna thought
can only go as far as the language that
paves the road so if we want to expand
the limits of our own mind and therefore
the collective mind or our potential as
a species we have to create the
knowledge ideas and beliefs that
permeate culture and influence language
that way Collective thought can be
expanded and exponential progress can be
made the future of work in my eyes
belongs to the creative the writers the
speakers the designers the creators
every person that we thought AI would
replace instead AI will act as a tool to
help these people push the boundaries
and so to do this well work is necessary
but rest and proper rest is going to
become even more important and so rest
and Leisure and contemplation are of
utmost importance and that is because of
the dmn or the default mode Network in
the brain the dmn is a series of
interconnected sections that activate as
soon as people stop concentrating on
external tasks and shift from outward
Focus to inward focused cognition in
short the brain is more active when you
are not working and so when we as humans
prioritize rest and I'm not talking
about the modern notion of stuffing your
face with ice cream chugging a bottle of
wine and binge watching Netflix but I'm
talking about going to the gym going on
walks reading contemplating visualizing
thinking getting creative journaling
brain dumping all of that stuff by doing
that we Prime our mind for novel ideas
the ones that allow new language beliefs
ideas and thoughts to pave the road of
thought and through the power of
internet where information is so easily
spreadable and accessible Collective
knowledge increases and our capacity for
development increases along with it so
to get practical you now have the
opportunity to pursue meaningful work
that unlocks the parts of the brain that
modern society has neglected for so long
humans can explore reality with passion
explore their skill set and
self-actualize now let's talk about why
the Creator economy is the new economy
so I've been talking about this for a
while now but I came across a Twitter
thread from Matt Mike and it was a great
thread that brought a new perspective or
brought some new ideas to the theory
that I've been preaching in my previous
videos so my theory is that everyone
will be creators Freelancers remote
workers mostly creators right if they
have a personal brand you have that leg
up and there's a lot of objections
behind that like oh I'm not experienced
enough yeah you are it's you embodied
it's an extension of yourself displayed
on the internet and you are improving
and providing value along the way and
through that it is a public school a
public resume for job work and a public
school but in the other sense right one
where you learn from others and one
where you teach so others can learn from
you and then it is like a progressive
actualization hierarchy and everyone can
evolve Beyond so I'm going to summarize
a few points for Matt Mike's thread I
wouldn't encourage you to look him up on
Twitter follow him I'm sure you can type
in the search bar like the name of the
thread or Devin take the link and just
pop it in the description right now if
you can no I don't think I will but
first we need to step back and think
about how important social media is
because a lot of people say it can be
toxic yes and that we would be better
off without it and yes in some cases
it's all relative but at the same time
the people that are saying it's toxic
don't realize that social media is a
reflection of yourself because the
algorithm gives you what you want to see
so by giving attention and falling into
your negativity bias and enjoying the
toxicity you are conditioning the
algorithm and therefore conditioning
your brain into this Echo chamber of
toxicity because like my social media
flight isn't toxic I love my social
media feed I love learning I get new
ideas every day it's very conducive to
my lifestyle I just enjoy it all around
if I don't like something I see
scroll past it block unfollow it's that
simple close your eyes so humans are
social creatures and social media
removes the barriers of socialization
through media so media is the front end
of the internet code is the back end of
the internet media of course includes
things like video writing and all the
different forms of those things I talk
about this in many videos primarily the
one million dollar skill stack where you
have to understand media in order to
make any form of an income for yourself
right media is how you communicate
online or even in a physical location
you could consider yourself media right
you could consider your business online
a one-person media company so media is
how we learn media is how we get new
information media is how we communicate
the value of our businesses media
consumes a large portion of our lives
and I would argue that it forms a large
amount of the social fabric that we
operate on as a civilization so PS I
teach all of this with notion templates
in my master class digital economics so
if you want to learn how how to get on
on the future of work as I like to put
it or learn how to personal brand or
become a Creator and learn my content
strategies and systems branding
marketing product sales all of the above
and how to uh the best way I can paint
it is recently
I got someone saying that they're gonna
have to go through it time and time
again as they're executing for a year
that's how much is in it because you
guys know whether you like to admit it
or not that this thing takes time
business takes time and a year of going
through and executing on a course I
believe is invaluable of course it can
take less time but expect a year to see
some decent results and to make some
decent money so in terms of the thread
that Matt Mike wrote uh he Illustrated
that there were three layers of social
media in terms of the value that each of
those created in terms of income and
audience so platforms were the first
form of digital media so something like
a phone and Google and apple kind of
rule this domain right a platform is the
first layer that generated trillions of
dollars and billions of users and the
the apps so social media the second
layer apps of Twitter Instagram Tick
Tock YouTube all of the above they
captured the same amount of value over
time right they through to that amount
of value trillions of dollars flowing
billions of users and then the third
layer that most people don't realize
because they're so sucked into the apps
that they don't realize that there is a
third layer that is the Creator and huge
creators
are predicted like Rogan Mr Beast to
generate trillions of dollars and have
billions of followers right so as that
value transfers over into the Creator
layer of that then the biggest ones are
going to have that insane leverage right
they are going to be media companies and
the smaller ones it's like you don't
need trillions of dollars and billions
of followers right you need a million
dollars a year and maybe 200
000 followers creators are atomizing
what the social networks did by
capturing Mass attention forming
communities Distributing media and
generating revenue and this makes even
more sense when we think about the
exponential growth that Automation and
AI have seen very recently right because
it's human nature to want human no
matter how human a robot can be it's
still going to be under like the lens of
a human right like I could make my
account all AI if it was perfect and to
the point I don't want to do that like I
saw tweet from Jim Claire the other day
where all the AI Bros all the eyebrows
are like oh you can automate all of your
writing and he's like what if I want to
write and he's like well hey I can do
that for you it's like I want to write
and it's the same with videos it's like
I want to create it's fun it feels good
and AI is naturally going to shift to
take over the things that humans don't
want to do and that's the thing the need
for human is still there the creators
are going to be the next layer of media
that generate the the most value in
other words personal brands or however
you want to frame it when I first heard
the term Creator I'm like that sounds
kind of cringe I don't really want to be
a Creator but then I tie it into like I
am a Creator God is a Creator not that
I'm saying I'm God but I'm saying like
you have the gift of creation right and
so creators are people that educate
entertain and Inspire in the crevices of
reality that they choose to explore by
their own curiosity and so unless we
rewrite the collective which hasn't
changed for centuries then this isn't
going to change robots do however have
their place in increasing human
creativity and decreasing labor so My
Philosophy is the same business is an
extension of the self being a Creator is
an extension of the self personal brand
same thing it is a vessel for your
purpose because your purpose means you
are part of something greater it means
that you are contributing to something
so people that aren't living with
purpose aren't contributing to something
greater than themselves which could be a
community of people by providing value
in exchange for another form of value
and so your purpose evolves from
superficial to metaphysical as you solve
The Superficial shallow problems in your
life and business reflects that right
personal development is about solving
your own problems business is about
solving other people's problems so if
you take that and you collapse them into
one and you solve your own problems you
document the process online and you ask
for some money in return by creating a
product or a system or implementation
then it all works itself out you are the
niche watch the video the most
profitable Niche is you and so the
pattern here is that the Eternal
markings in business if you're going to
watch any marketing course or buy
anything on marketing you're going to
learn about the Eternal markets which
are health wealth relationships and
happiness optional so if you solve your
own problems by self-education and skill
acquisition to fix your health problems
get fit right you have your own goals
you have your own desires so lean into
them solve the problem standing in the
way fix your money problems next then
fix your relationships issues fix your
mindset issues and your mental health
issues and then once you do you can
self-reflect and look back okay what did
I do let me piece these together into
the form of a step-by-step advice with
an overarching Theory or philosophy or
what I've learned pack setup distribute
it via the right modality right so maybe
it's a course maybe an email course
maybe an e-book maybe just a traditional
course maybe a physical product right
like if I got a lot of peace out of
journaling then I'm going to create my
own with my own prompts what about a
physical planner what about the clothes
I like to wear is there meaning behind
it is because there's no uh like
microplastics in Cotton shirts am I
going to start a Cotton brand around a
meaningful philosophy to me so by
leveraging the creativity that is being
freed up by Ai and whatever
self-improvers are creating their own
career paths simply it's just baked into
it right you solve your own problems and
human behavior revolves around problems
people pay to have their problems solved
for them so by improving yourself you
set yourself up for massive financial
success and I've made videos extensively
about all of this just under different
lenses because I was talking with Clark
Kegley big YouTuber at Coffee the other
day and I need to lean more into the
one-person business the lifestyle design
that kind of stuff because it's like
when you listen to your favorite artist
you just want to hear their same tracks
right when they when a punk artist goes
pop and you're like I hate this I want
to hear these songs and and you listen
to them on repeat it's the same thing
right you just say one thing a thousand
different ways in the Creator economy
and when people change that's when they
die because you guys want to learn more
about the one-person business and simply
by me repeating the same thing it's
going to condition your mind to see
success in that domain and you're going
to enjoy it so we've talked about this
multiple times before as well but again
we're repeating stuff here if you want
the full breakdown go watch the best
business model to make a million dollars
in three to five years uh great video I
think but we're going to talk about some
monetization methods so the first is
service business right freelance
Consulting coaching or tutoring and so
when you first start out you don't have
a large following but you do have Labor
and time right that you can put in so
you can do direct Outreach and you can
charge a higher price to sustain a
higher income without trying to bank on
an audience that you don't have right so
you have to do client work and that way
you can get dedicated one-on-one results
for them and then when you have more
leverage you have an audio and you have
the results you've refined the system
because you know what works now from
working with people one-on-one then you
create a cohort or you create a product
or something like that and use the
results to sell it to your audience that
you've acquired by giving out value
because with a service you only need
like two to three clients to make a
pretty decent income instead of like 100
200 300 course sales because if you
don't have the traffic via an audience
or a following then you aren't going to
sustain the sales you need a service and
so the next thing you can do is you can
turn that into a cohort or a course so
my favorite way to do it is a cohort
because you're still charging a higher
price because you're still involved and
you're still helping people get better
results but you create a curriculum
right you create a curriculum and then
you have weekly calls to help walk
people through it and then you can
charge for like a group coaching price
of like 500 a thousand fifteen hundred
something like like that for like eight
weeks and then once you're done with
that you turn it into a course and you
already have the curriculum you already
have results you already have
testimonials and by now a year later you
have fifty thousand a hundred thousand
followers
you're making up more of an income with
way less work and if you are still
aren't sold on the information
businesses or the education businesses
wait until the next video where I
obliterate all of your limiting beliefs
and so the next thing is to build
whatever you want right now you have
leverage you have experience and you
have resources to transfer over into the
Endeavor that you want to pursue so if
you want to start a clothing brand now
you have the resources to do so right
you don't have to procrastinate and have
shiny objects syndrome for 10 years and
never start the clothing brand or what I
plan to do hopefully next year or the
year after I'm going to start a modern
Mastery gym and it's going to be
epic and you guys are all going to fly
out and we're gonna have a lift we're
gonna get jacked or if you want to sell
a supplement line like I've been on the
fence many times of selling a focus
supplement and even like a recovery
supplement and things like that simply
because I can just make a video on
productivity plug the focus supplement
and then people get results with it and
I make money and it like it just makes
sense that's what business is you
provide something that makes people
happy and they give you money and people
that don't like sales don't like making
other people happy so the future is
bright for the people that take
responsibility for their lives to
reiterate this point because I want to
drill it into your head the Eternal
markets and business are health wealth
relationships and happiness these are
where all burning Evergreen problems
that people will face until the end of
time so solve your own problems document
the solution get paid and have a good
rest of your day because that's the end
of the video but be sure to like
