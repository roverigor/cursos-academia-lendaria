here's how to do a hard reset on your
life in 30 minutes this is a process
that I run through when my life gets a
bit too messy it's those times when I
start to think back of when life was
better like when things just get bogged
down and you don't feel like you're
living the same life that you were or
when you aren't making as much progress
as you previously were and you're
thinking like what am I doing different
like what's going on uh why do I feel
this way and your routines start to fall
apart and little tasks work their way in
unconsciously and you're you just feel
like you don't have any time or are
unable to do the work that you used to
do really well so the first thing we're
going to do is take note of how we feel
throughout the day and for all of this
you're going to have to pull out a piece
of paper or a notebook I recommend
buying a journal just having one on hand
to write things down is so so so
important you can download my free Power
planner and uh print that out if you
want to use that to help do this and
plan your weeks but you're going to note
two things down the first thing is
exactly what you are doing on a daily
basis every single thing just write it
down as you're going about the day what
are you doing what are you thinking
about uh what do you feel like you have
to do etc etc and then the second thing
that you're going to write down is
exactly how you feel during these times
right and you're good get very specific
with this because you're putting your
mind on paper your mind is very complex
and if you don't have accurate data on
your paper you're not going to be able
to move on to the next step in a way
that allows you to do it very well and
effectively so the next step is to
prioritize remove and restructure
because the reason you aren't getting
results or the reason you feel like life
isn't as good as it once was is because
you either feel too pressed for time
which is usually the cause of stress
right you're in this very narrow State
and you just feel like you don't have
any time but in reality you're just
sitting there thinking you don't have
any time when you could would actually
be doing the thing that you're putting
off second thing is that you just don't
have the energy to get results living in
that stressed out State takes a lot of
mental energy to actually like narrow
your focus in whether you're paying
attention to just random thoughts or
other things it takes a lot of uh
precious mental energy that you don't
you weren't structuring in a way that is
conducive to getting more results and
then the last thing is that maybe you've
just stopped doing the things that get
results I see this all the time in
business it's like hey I'm not reaching
out to get clients why am I not getting
clients and it's like
you kind of are answering your own
question there you're just not doing the
thing that actually gets results and so
look over what you wrote down in Step
One what can you change so with this
you're going to kind of just create your
own structure here and you're going to
like Circle things that will get you
results or you're going to write down
the things that get you results and
you're going to prioritize those and
then you're going to remove the things
that snuck in there or the things that
snuck into your day and don't deserve to
be there and could be draining mental
monetary or even physical energy and
then you're going to restructure
specific tasks and obligations so get
the chaotic structure of your mind onto
paper and reorganize it and then step
number three is to create a week-long
plan because as we talk about in many
videos this is the supreme law of the
universe is entropy it comes into play
in almost every situation in your life
and that is why you are in this state of
chaos is because of entropy the
organization of your life and therefore
your mind the thing that you have to
keep organized and use to move move
throughout life tends towards disorder
if you aren't performing this whole
mental housekeeping thing of writing
down everything that's on your mind
restructuring reorganizing it literally
taking your mind putting it on paper and
ordering it in a way that makes sense
and allows you gives you Clarity to
execute and so by not doing this it's
dangerous because you can pick up bad
habits along the way and so bad habits
are difficult to break and that's for
another video or buy a book on habit
formation but you can make the process
of eliminating these bad habits a lot
easier with Clarity just prioritizing
Clarity in your life so take 10 minutes
and on a new page you're going to write
down every single thing that you're
going to do over the next week and this
shouldn't sound crazy or difficult it
takes 10 minutes and it will help you so
so so much but just doing this alone
reduces the friction that allows you to
make better decisions so write out
exactly what you're going to do for your
morning routine uh what tasks you're
going to to complete during your focused
work routine what you other specific
tasks and obligations that you have to
get done like meetings and how those are
going to lay out in your day and then
write out exactly what you're going to
do in between that time and your nightly
routine and with this as with almost
everything we talk about like this isn't
a quick fix this isn't an instant thing
like you're not going to be some people
will write this down and they'll have a
great time and it'll work really well
other people you're going to have to
experiment you're going to write things
down and then as you're trying to
execute on it you're going to hit a
problem and then you're going to have to
deal with that mentally and you're going
to have to go back to what you wrote
down change it for the next day to
something that you think will work
better trial and error and then over
time throughout the week you just get
into this Flow by solving the problems
that come up along the way and then you
have a system that over the next month
you can just do every single day and it
becomes that much easier and then
eventually that becomes habit and prefer
terribly you are doing the things that
move you towards your purpose or your
vision or the highest version of
yourself and so that's really it for
this one I thought this would be helpful
uh come with the start of the New Year
I'm not a huge fan of New Year's
resolutions but I do think that now is
as better time as any to actually start
doing this but uh setting a new year's
resolution or a goal or just anything
when you decide to make a change it
isn't going to be sustainable unless you
have absolute Clarity to on how to reach
that goal unless you have a system that
you can repeat daily and make it a part
of your life and base your identity
around it in alignment with the higher
version of yourself so you're working to
try and survive or actualize that
highest version because humans survive
on a conceptual level and we try to
survive the things that we identify with
so if you identify with the highest
version of yourself or your purpose and
create a system that allows you to act
in alignment with that then eventually
that
you become that so that's it for this
