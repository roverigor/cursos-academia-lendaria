one meaningful project one hour of
focused work one day at a time without
waiver that's the secret you're looking
for that's what we're here to discuss
today it is a simple framework for
creating a better life for yourself but
first we need to understand its
importance why is focused work a
superpower happiness is a skill and it's
easier than ever to practice unhappiness
how we don't live in the same world as
our ancestors the physical world is
relatively similar of course we build
buildings cities countries the road
system everything that we see today in
the world our routines are a bit
different than they used to be of course
with the change that has come but the
environment has changed so much to the
point that it could be detrimental to
our long-term Health unless we revert
back or create a sustainable solution
and now I've been going down multiple
rabbit holes if you haven't already read
the short story The Gentle seduction you
can just find it with a Google search
but it kind of opens your mind up to the
potential of the future and I'm not sure
what the next phase of evolution is but
I'm pretty sure it's gonna be chemical
enhancement like that people talk about
in the biohacking community that Bridges
us from where we are now to like being
cyborgs and being able to live forever
right now it seems like our goal is to
prolong our health with longevity
practices to the point where we can
reverse aging as a whole or that's
that's all we're doing with evolution is
we're trying to reverse entropy and the
problems that come with entropy so
that's that's a topic for another time
maybe we'll dive into it sometime
probably not but the physical world has
kind of changed but the mental world has
changed entirely we continue to build
the physical world and our mind has to
adapt and evolve and transcend in order
for us to even have the ideas that
create the physical world and for every
single thing that we create in the
physical world it demands ten a hundred
a thousand ideas and iterations of the
ideas in our mind and so this starts to
paint the picture of the information
landscape that we have access to that is
drastically different from the old world
and so at the Inception of human
consciousness we transcended and
included the physical world beneath us
and the biological world right animal
life and with every advancement or stage
of evolution we hold everything under it
but then what is above it is 10 to a
hundred thousand to a thousand times the
depth and span of what lies in that so
the mental world is so much larger and
chaotic than the physical and biological
world and so here's a graphic I got this
uh concept or just illustration from a
brief history of everything by Ken
Wilbur and you can notice some
connections here right between physics
biology psychology theology mysticism
and how those align with Spirit soul
mind body matter but in the mental plane
or the plane of Soul or Spirit it just
gets increasingly more complex right but
it gives us so much more of a creative
ability and so let's think of the old
world as an acorn and the new world as
an oak tree here's an image of an oak
tree and these things can grow to be six
hundred two thousand years old and they
just get more and more complex over time
you can see that there's a core right
which could be the essence of being and
it splits off in three to six major
areas and continues to split into
branches that may live or fall off and
thousands upon thousands of leaves and
each Leaf having an ecosystem within
itself similar to that of the Oak and so
we can think of this oak tree as a
watered-down description of reality
beyond what you can see with your
limited perception as a human and if you
don't understand what I mean by that I
mean like frogs being able to see colors
that we do not have access to there is
more than we can perceive as human
beings and if you are not open to that
then your creativity is massively
hindered and your connection with any
form of spiritual entity or experience
and of course when it comes to plant
life or just this Oak Tree in general
that at times it becomes necessary to
prune a branch so that it can grow
better or go into a new direction right
in in forms of humans because that is US
interacting with Evolution and allowing
us to shape where we go but another
Point here is that there are infinite
branches and leaves to be explored by
the mind but most people are conditioned
into the singular branch and possibly
singular leaf that they were conditioned
into throughout their childhood go to
school get a job retire at 65 and the
information and worldview that is
adopted along with that this keeps you
heavily limited and if you want you can
think of that singular Branch or Leaf as
what people coin as the Matrix and you
being trapped in that perspective for
your entire life and never having the
ability to open your mind and see new
potentials for your life and so the
major problem here is that it is too
easy for Modern Man to get sucked into a
Mindless trap of mediocrity degeneracy
and roboticism and when people try to
break away from the default path into
something that is unknown they get
scared they get afraid they dip their
toe in they realize oh I'm very
comfortable right now in my own little
situation and they step out it's too
cold or it's too hot there's too much
information to explore too many
opportunities that cause overwhelm too
many opinions that lead to anxiety to
find Clarity you have to battle through
the chaos you can't just shy away at the
first sight of struggle so to help wrap
our heads around this for every good
thought there is a hundred bad thoughts
so the thought of good health or you
trying to achieve good health there is a
hundred bad thoughts because of the
information that is available to you and
that is marketed towards you by let's
say mainstream media as one source of
that information and so when you think
of good health if you are not solely
focused on that and don't have the goals
vision and Clarity that allows you to
frame your mind so that distractions and
other information can't penetrate that
to distract you if you do not have that
then your mind can you're your focus
which is what we're talking about today
can split to a negative thought of oh
eggs are worse than cigarettes oh they
cause cancer
and then that leads to oh I smoke so
that's even worse for my health why am I
even going after this health goal in the
first place if I'm doing all these
things that contribute to poor health
and then it starts to split off into a
holistic but negative world view where
you're like oh but I don't have money in
order to get the quality ingredients
that I need to optimize my health I
can't afford a gym membership and so
business comes into play and you're like
if you don't have a vision or Clarity on
run how to start or run a business or
just fix your money problems in general
you can see where this splits and where
people get so overwhelmed and anxious is
because they don't have Clarity or a
direction or aim for their life in order
to focus their attention and they
haven't educated themselves enough with
quality information to the point of
being able to solely focus on that
because they're confident in their
ability to act and they're making
progress every single day they're taking
on a challenge their skill is up to that
challenge so that they don't get anxious
or they're not taking on too low level
of a challenge like a corporate job or
something that they've done over and
over and over again to the point of
getting bored with it and thinking their
mind splitting because of that because
they're like oh I'm bored I could be
doing something better with my time and
then you go down a negative thought Loop
that way as well and so this is the
point of focus you have to learn to
order your mind you need to be able to
create Clarity from chaos and have
direction for your life every single
morning and feel like you are making
progress so you can tap into some degree
of the flow state which is where you
need feedback by your environment to
know that you're making meaningful
progress in life because you felt it
before you know how [ __ ] amazing
Clarity and pure progress feels and once
you seek to understand how to recreate
that in your life then that's how you
create enjoyment on a daily basis so
let's start by understanding that if you
don't program your own mind it will be
programmed by someone else and the age
of information is extremely overwhelming
in this matter because everyone's trying
to program you they're trying to
condition you and this isn't a bad thing
but you have to be able to choose and
limit your inputs from every plane of
existence so that that's how you
condition yourself is by curate the
information that you allow to condition
your mind and so let's start with the
digital plane of existence where you
immerse yourself in the information that
will program you for Success so unfollow
accounts that don't serve your future
buy books that increase your awareness
of your potential subscribe to podcasts
newsletters and blogs that teach you
what the schools won't every single
place you turn you need to curate a
digital environment that is conducive to
the Future that you want for yourself
and if you don't hold that future in the
back of your mind then it's so much
easier to get distracted and so now the
mental plane you need to treat your mind
as a garden your thoughts they can be
well kept and beautiful or they can grow
like weeds and lead to a chaotic
downward spiral and as the Arabs say the
nature of the rain is the same but it
makes Thorns grow in the marshes and
flowers in the gardens and now the
physical plane which is my favorite one
to kind of think about because in the
past people would form settlements right
and so we can think of this today as
people that settle for where they are in
their life they don't pursue anything
more than a certain level that they've
reached be because they think that's
enough because Society said it was
enough to operate within society and
feed that machine and so people in these
settlements they group together into
these environments and just justify each
other's mediocre behavior and they
program themselves to think that it's
normal or a good thing and now if this
is what you want to do go ahead and do
it but if you don't want to do it that's
why you're watching this video if you
want to be a mediocre piece of [ __ ]
go watch another video I don't know the
unknown is where your potential lies the
single most important decision you make
is where you live it drives your
business opportunities relationships
food and water supply politics
activities and day-to-day quality of
life you need to set higher [ __ ]
standards for yourself I've I'm going to
write a newsletter and create a video on
this at some point but your standards
really like if you're okay with ten
thousand dollars in your bank account
then you're not gonna see anything less
than ten thousand dollars as a problem
or you're not going to see ten thousand
dollars as a problem in your bank
account if you don't see the environment
you live in that is impacting the food
that you can have and the same with your
money if your standards for your money
are so low to the point where you can't
afford quality food and you're just
complaining all day about how wealthy
and happy or wealthy and healthy people
are privileged because they can buy
quality food it's because your standards
across the board for your life are
absolute [ __ ] they're so low if you
can't afford high quality food it's
because your standards for your own work
ethic and business are non-existent and
so you isolate the problems of health
and being able to afford quality food in
your life as separate when in fact they
work together you have to aim for
holistic self-improvement health wealth
relationships Mind Body Spirit business
all of them play into each other and
come up together if you want to be
healthy then you're gonna have to fix
your [ __ ] finances and if you're not
doing anything to increase the status in
your job or start a business or do
something or budget to make more money
there's millions of different techniques
to increase your income then clearly you
have no room to complain about not being
able to afford high quality food or to
invest in your health and then how that
both of those play a role in the
relationships you have access to and
since those standards are so low for
your food health and business and
finances then your relationships are
also going to lower to that standard and
the entirety of your life is going to
suck so this is all to say that you are
a product of your environment if your
standards are low it's usually because
you haven't put yourself in a digital
physical or mental environment that
would program you to increase your
standards or to think that having higher
standards is normal and so these thought
processes that are created from the
environments that you reside in become
habitual and they become who you are and
then you start to work to survive your
identity by justifying your own actions
and reinforcing your own beliefs by
following the people and putting
yourself in the environments that allow
you to settle there because most people
wake up after 40 Years of robotic living
wondering where the time went you don't
have to be one of them imagine having a
spreadsheet that displayed how much
attention you've invested in any given
area of your life Mind Body Spirit and
business that impact your relationship
with the world and those around you the
spreadsheet would be a direct indicator
of your quality of life that is a quote
from my book The Art of focus coming out
soon September 5th I believe there's the
official launch date we're getting
things together right now but more info
on that to come focus is the habit of
habits it is the thing that comes before
habits The Habit that comes before any
other Habit in your life focus is the
root of your entire being it is how you
Channel your awareness Consciousness and
attention toward value or distraction
conscious focus on your long to
short-term goals are how you program
your own mind for success and daily
quality of life and so here we want to
increase the ratio of expensive to cheap
dopamine sources in our life we want to
increase the signal to noise
significance to insignificance and
meaningful to meaningless ratios because
dopamine makes you feel good and this
isn't a bad thing it's just a matter of
where you actually get it dopamine is
the molecule of human behavior and why
we act on certain things that we do just
because you aren't scrolling you aren't
scrolling on your phone and soaking in
the cheap dopamine doesn't mean that you
shouldn't be leveraging a
neurotransmitter in your brain to
achieve some form of success and so we
start by creating a hierarchy of goals
for ourself because if you don't have
conscious meaningful goals you won't be
able to place your focus on the things
that matter or at least it just won't be
top of mind you're going to get
distracted and your attention is going
to be manhandled just by you going about
day-to-day life without actually trying
to control it and it doesn't matter if
you don't know what those goals should
be yet just pick something that sounds
meaningful only then can you realize
what you don't want by pursuing
something that you think you want
realizing oh this wasn't it but now I'm
acting from a place of better experience
so I can set the next goal and continue
self-correcting until I'm going in a
much better Direction in reality and so
if you want just a set way to do this if
you Vibe with my message then check out
the courses to our writer or digital
economics to learn the high value skill
of writing or just to turn yourself and
your interest into a business I feel
like that's a great direction to start
for many people and so to to start this
off of what we just talked about here's
what you do the first thing is that you
need to zoom out and gain perspective
think about your ideal future have you
ever done that if so when was the last
time pull out a notebook and describe it
in detail spend 30 minutes writing what
you think you want Mind Body Spirit
business and how those things will
impact every area of your life in a
beneficial Manner and now contrast that
life with the life that you have now
this is your vision for the future it is
a big medical that houses the rest of
your goals and this gives you a lens or
a frame to view daily situations from
and focus your attention on the right
things if you do not have a vision or
goals at the top of your mind how are
you going to make better decisions for
your life you can't you don't know what
decision to make that will lead towards
the goal or the vision if you don't have
it there then every single one of your
actions are meaningless and you're
currently viewing life from a lens of
unconscious goals because everything is
goal oriented we're taking actions
towards a goal no matter what it is
right so your actions are meaningless if
you don't have conscious self-generated
goals to help frame your decisions but
aside from that if you don't have your
own you're operating from the lens of
unconscious goals that Society projected
on you like getting a better short-term
job or having quick superficial sex or
every other low conscious problem that
people are so focused on solving in
their life but never really get them
anywhere and a note with this is that
you do have to solve these problems but
you have to solve them from a long-term
standpoint because even just like even
if you just want to have sex with
someone like go try expose yourself to
the experience fail a few times failures
are the foundation for your quality of
life and you need to learn by exposing
yourself to experience and reality don't
just sit around mentally masturbating
over things you have to go out and do
things and reap the lessons from them
and then Channel those failures towards
your goals so the next thing from that
zoomed out perspective and our vision
for the future we need to deconstruct
that Vision into smaller goals to bridge
the clarity Gap so in that same notebook
where you wrote out your vision take it
out again and write out a 10-year goal a
one-year goal this month's goal this
week's goal and what you can do today
don't attach to these goals this is just
a practice to generate Clarity your
goals will evolve with time and that's
okay goals can change I can have a
different goal tomorrow if I wanted to
as as long as I have a goal and I'm
making decisions towards a better life
for myself so step number three after
that is to zoom in with that Clarity to
act with purpose so hold that frame in
the back of your mind right the focus
channel from which you view daily
situations this is the Habit that we're
forming is zooming out gaining
perspective and acting from a place
where we can make better decisions and
perceive situations so that we can
identify problems in the ways of our
goals you are trying to decrease the
amount of distraction in your life by
consistently and habitually bringing
your focus back from distraction to what
you deem as important and the things
that are important or are signal or are
significant are the things that align
with the actualization of your goals and
this is what you notice this is how you
reap good dopamine when you have a goal
in your mind like getting absolutely
jacked out of your mind and you go on
social media and you see a tip that will
help you with that then boom that's
meaningful dopamine and you need to save
what that is and implement it in your
life and so now the question is what do
we zoom in our focus on how do we
actually make tangible progress and how
do we know that we're making progress
every single day because the modern
world is an infinite web of information
ideas opportunities business models
relationship advice productivity
Doctrine conspiracy theories news and
drama that you can get lost in if you do
not train your focus at the current
level of your life 99 of the information
that you are exposed to does not [ __ ]
matter it is a distraction get used to
that get used to registering 99 of the
information that you are exposed to as a
distraction and learning to focus on the
important things so we start with one
meaningful project so what from what you
wrote down in your notebook we're going
to turn goals into projects and you are
the meta project you are your life's
work you as a project are composed of
interconnected planes of existence that
make life enjoyable Mind Body Spirit and
money yes money is necessary it is the
bridge of Commerce the lifeblood of
society it how you bring the future you
want to build to life and share it with
other people so that they can benefit
from it and you can contribute to
humanity and so also in business there
are the Eternal markets which are health
wealth relationships happiness which can
also connect to Mind Body Spirit
business and this is where burning
profitable problems lie so by treating
each domain of your life as a project
and creating projects out of those areas
in order to identify and solve problems
and create Solutions so as the project
right the project is the solution and so
once you create the project then boom
you turn yourself into the business do
you see like how all of this comes full
circle with all the [ __ ] that I talk
about is by just improving your life and
making conscious effort towards your
goals and making tangible projects that
you can pass down to other people you
create a life of impact money and
fulfillment and so you can also view
projects as quests and a video game and
this is what makes video games so
enjoyable is that it Narrows your mind
on the hierarchy of goals that composes
the project you begin to control your
attention every single morning you start
to move with purpose through the world
and people notice it in your walk and
how you hold yourself so from one
meaningful project now we need one hour
of focused work focus is a muscle start
with four sets of 20 minutes rest
between sets Progressive overload still
applies to mental lifting when you get
stronger add more weight increase to
four sets of 45 minutes train your focus
to hit your ideal Financial Physique in
record time you don't need 12 hours a
day to actualize your dreams anyone that
tells you that is either an idiot or
they don't have perspective or they're
just giving their own experience which
there's nothing wrong with that as long
as they're giving it from their personal
experience and if that was the case 12
hours a day then nobody would see any
form of success they don't have that
much time on their hands when they have
other responsibilities flooding their
lives adults have responsibilities they
have families jobs bills to pay and if
you're young then yeah you have a huge
[ __ ] advantage and you need to take
advantage of it so for your first
meaningful project that you're going to
dedicate one hour focused attention you
need to pick the one that solves the
most prevalent problem in your life and
this is your purpose if you if you're
trying to find your purpose here it is
so you need to sit with it contemplate
it and create your plan of attack are
you overweight are you broke are you
stressed all the time do you hate your
job do you lack energy what is it what
are you sweeping under the rug so you
don't have to face the pain that comes
with growth that's the difference
between a video game and The Game of
Life Is there is going to be actual real
pain but the pleasure derived from it is
so much more than that of a video game
so if solved what problem would unlock
the next level of enjoyment in your life
and so from there you must deconstruct
that goal into actions and that way you
have something to incorporate in your
lifestyle every single hour that you
dedicate when our folks work and for
this your life must change on a
fundamental level right you you're going
to have to fit this into your day and
prioritize it because arguably it is the
most important thing in your life it's
your purpose right it has to become the
first thing you do every single morning
or it has to be so habitual later in the
day that other distractions and
responsibilities don't get in its way
you're going to have to wake up earlier
so if you need money dedicate the first
hour of your day to education and action
around money if you want to lose weight
dedicate the first hour of your day to
education and action around Fitness if
you want to decrease stress dedicate the
first hour of your day to education and
action around mental health it's that
simple don't look for a shortcut on this
that's not going to lead anywhere good
this is a lifestyle this is your entire
life you're going to be doing one hour
Focus to work for the rest of your life
every single morning do it so the last
part of this is one meaningful project
one hour Focus work one day at a time
without waiver focus is a currency and
when you invest it in your own education
work rest and success the results won't
be immediate consistency is a
requirement actually scratch that
consistency is overrated persistency is
underrated with a p persistence and
iteration are requirements for projects
to lead to a better future for yourself
you must show up every single day with
the intention to build a project that
lives into the future this is how you
become a confident and interesting
person this is the unconventional if not
the only path to self-confidence and
just feeling good about yourself is by
actually having some form of value that
you can give to other people because
there's so much more under that it shows
competence it shows time invested and it
shows that you've had to acquire the
information and perspective that allows
you to see situations from a nuanced
perspective it shows experience when you
are hell-bent on creating your vision
for the future people notice and they
want to join you they want to follow you
towards that vision and so how do you
make persistent actions seamless it's by
scheduling lever moving tasks into high
energy time blocks in your day as to
methods there may be a million and then
some but principles are few the man who
grasp principles can successfully select
his own methods the man who tries
methods ignoring principles is sure to
have trouble that's a quote by
Harrington Emerson that illustrates the
importance of what lever moving actions
actually are they're the principles
behind the methods or the tactics that
people talk about where someone's like
oh start this social media marketing
agency to make a million dollars a year
or use these use this AI business model
to make a million dollars a year those
are tactics those are methods those are
operating from principles that the
creators understand you need to absorb
the principles by studying multiple
different perspectives through your
education and noting the patterns of
what allows all of them to do better
which I can tell you what it is right
now it's from my one million dollar
skill Stack video writing speaking
Marketing sales paired with your
personal interests and tactics along
with all of those that you learn with
time so the key to persistency is
momentum and you need to stack small
wins because why would you ever keep
playing a game if it wasn't ever fun if
you never saw any form of progress right
this is mostly in the individual's
control people can say oh you just need
discipline you need to stick it out if
you're not seeing small wins then you're
not doing the right things because if
you want to lose weight it is foolish to
start reading a book on hyperthyroidism
before learning the principles of
training and nutrition if you want to
start a business it is foolish to buy a
course on client acquisition with
Facebook ads before learning the
principles of traffic and offers if you
want to go on a date it is foolish to
learn game before understanding the
principles of social intimate or
business relationships and you'll notice
these principles overlap in multiple
domains like bodybuilding to business
there's a lot of parallels there like
just Progressive overload in general
where you add a little bit of weight to
the bar right you don't try to increase
your income by a hundred thousand
dollars a month in one month you try to
increase it by five thousand thousand
and then it progressively picks up and
before you know it you're bench pressing
a financial 315 pounds for 10 reps so
with lever moving tasks and once you
identify what those are through
education you're gonna have to learn
because I can't I can't give every
single if I were I would have to give
tactics right I don't want to do that I
would have to give prescriptions how
to's and these narrow little things that
pigeonholes everyone's perspective into
the same thing so that only point zero
one percent of them get results you have
to go and [ __ ] figure it out for
yourself and so the last thing is that
you need to schedule these things in a
high energy time block now if you want
to do this midday go ahead if you want
to do in the afternoon go ahead but for
most it makes sense to block out the
first hour of your morning to make this
happen and that's where people have the
most time and energy no matter if you're
in a night owl or not even night owls
when you're operating from that default
mode Network State that's when you're
the most creative anyways go to work
tired you'll do better work and your
energy may not be highest during this
time of day but you have a limited
amount of energy every single day and if
you're trying to work after you're
drained all of it then it's going to be
low quality and so yeah this is going to
be difficult you're going to have to
wake up for a week until it becomes
somewhat normal you're gonna have to
wake up early for a month in order for
it to become something you actually
enjoy and you can work on whatever you
want during these times but realize that
distractions are subjective I'm not
saying that hanging out with your
friends in video games and partying all
this stuff is bad it's bad if it's
pulling you away from that one hour time
block now you have something tangible
you have a one meaningful project you
have one hour a day if anything pulls
you away from that then it's a
distraction if you complete that then go
ahead and be distracted by that at that
point it's not distracted it could
actually be very important to you and
maintaining those other pillars of your
life so work in the morning knock out
your priority tasks and enjoy the rest
of your day because you've already done
things that you need to do so that's it
for this video have an incredible
weekend or week ahead links in the
description for cool stuff learn a high
value skill with two-hour writer turn
yourself into the business with digital
economics like subscribe do all that
[ __ ] that people say at the end of a
YouTube video see you in the next one
peace
