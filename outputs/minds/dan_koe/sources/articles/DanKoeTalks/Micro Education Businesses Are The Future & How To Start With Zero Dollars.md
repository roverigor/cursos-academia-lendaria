I'm building a software company but I'm
taking a different approach the common
route would be to build the product test
it and Market it to a specific audience
this works but I want to skip the sync
or Swim phase of this business I'm well
aware that churn developer costs and
ingraining software in people's daily
lives will be difficult instead I plan
to take the company to 5 to 10 million
in its first year this is a lofty goal
yes but how am I going to do it by
leveraging the experience I've gained in
modern business I know the power of a
personal brand I know the power of
digital products and how a 10 million
dollar digital product business is more
profitable than most 50 million dollar
physical product businesses I know that
I can use both to create an education
product as the main driver of Revenue in
our first year of business with that
product operating at 95 profit margins
we will build the company's social media
like we would a personal brand with an
avatar as the face of the brand most
businesses have no idea what it takes to
build an actual social media audience so
they rely on Creator sponsorships when
we want to create a Creator we will use
that audience and a plethora of Creator
audiences to fuel a cohort based course
around the subject of our software at
that point it doesn't matter if the
software itself is profitable in the
first year we can play long term and
slowly inject it into the Creator
economy as the one true software I can't
give too many details yet on what it's
going to be because we're still doing
legal stuff and just want to make sure
we have all of our bases covered before
we actually reveal what it is so stay
tuned for that but this isn't a video
about the software it's a video about
how you can start a hyper profitable
education business with the knowledge in
your head you don't need to build a
software to make this work of course you
can build software based around the
profitable education product you sell to
enhance your business results if you
want to go down that road because you'll
have the money to invest in one but
here's what to expect in this video one
is why a social media audience is the
highest leveraged business asset to how
to create your own customers rather than
trying to find them with boring market
research three realizing that you have a
one hundred thousand dollar product
stuck in your head and how to extract it
let's talk about why audience building
is the greatest skill stack of our
decade personal brands are the new wave
that won't die out it's not a phase mom
the digital world is expanding faster
than the physical and personal brands
are the avatars that occupy the space
everyone has a personal brand everyone
is in the Creator economy but few
realize that their contributions posts
and products aren't contributions at all
consumers are too busy posting about
their lives to impress friends who
aren't really friends creators are
learning building and Distilling
valuable information that makes life
better for everyone so to understand
this we need to dive in and make the
realization of what own distribution is
and how powerful it is because I'm
connected with and follow many
high-level entrepreneurs some in private
Equity some in agency work and some in
software for related fields in almost
every single conversation we have the
point of owned distribution comes up I
don't know why I didn't start posting
content sooner it's insane how much the
marketing world has changed in a few
short years a personal brand is becoming
less and less optional those are a few
things that people have said directly to
me and those patterns keep coming up
when I talk to business owners that know
they need to start posting content or
just get in to Virtual Reality by
displaying their character as a personal
brand but of course this doesn't
eliminate the need for other types of
distribution there's manual distribution
like cold email cold calls or cold
direct message campaigns there's bot
distribution like purchasing Facebook
ads or Google ads there's borrowed
distribution like paying for podcast
YouTube or newsletter sponsorships and
then there's own distribution like
building an audience newsletter
Community or list of product buyers the
lines are blurred between them all and I
know I missed a few things like SEO but
they all have their use cases the first
three are incredible for testing they're
good for beginner business owners and
having some form of control over your
outcomes own distribution is a long-term
game that scares most people away let's
imagine I spent two years building a 100
000 follower audience if I promoted my
product every day for a month in a smart
way I would get at least a million
impressions how long would it take me to
direct message a million people a long
time how much would it cost for me to
reach that many people with ads around
seven thousand dollars a month based on
a seven dollar as an average CPM not to
mention own distribution compounds you
can get to 10 to 20 000 followers in a
year 50 to 100 000 in two years and
millions after four to five years that
is if you know how to iterate on your
best content or even write content in
the first place it only makes sense to
systemize your audience growth with time
and leverage other distribution methods
to make your desired Revenue this is
something that I teach in my course to
our writer for building a readership so
that you can eventually have traffic to
send to whatever it is you want to
monetize relating to your life's work
once you see the power of Personality
own distribution and flexibility of a
personal brand there's no going back to
become a good audience Builder you can't
just study audience building this is the
case for most skills that get abnormal
results it's not as simple as looking up
a video on the best skills to learn in
2023 because that's what everyone else
is doing it's a great way to commoditize
yourself and be replaceable audience
building is a stack of today's most
profitable skills graphic design content
writing copywriting marketing and sales
human nature psychology self-awareness
networking and more and it demands
multi-disciplinary study and expertise
audience building is a lifestyle it is
the act of capturing curating connecting
creating and distributing valuable
information resources and products in a
way that impacts positive behavior
change so I know I mentioned the
software earlier but that last sentence
is what the software is so maybe that's
some like pre-hype so you guys can start
to think about out what it actually is
that I'm building if you don't pursue a
better life for yourself you will fail a
better life demands the habits of
learning building and distributing so
now let's go over some rapid fire tips
to start learning building and
distributing because those are the main
things that you need to be doing in your
life as a way to provide value so that
you can get what you want because if you
want to get something from someone else
then you need to give them something so
they give you something that's just
value Exchange in general that's
communication that's everything you
can't do this alone you have to develop
yourself alone but then you have to
bring that self into the world so that
you can exchange with other people here
is exactly what you must do without the
fluff these must become habit that means
a part of your everyday life if you can
spend eight hours building someone
else's dreams you can spend one hour
building your own if you don't have one
hour a day to invest in having two hours
a day and so on you need to get your
priorities straight so first is learning
with intention learn the principles of
Marketing sales writing in social media
binge watched 30 or 50 hours of free
content and paid courses build your
personal brand along the way so you can
actually apply what you learn study what
interests you do not limit yourself if
you have the goal of building a better
life for yourself anything you learn
will be from that lens you are still
focusing on one thing even if you aren't
focusing on one thing focus on one thing
long term and focus on the multitude the
thousands of things short term that will
allow you to get there that's not shiny
object syndrome that's being smart and
diversifying your study when you feel
the excitement or dopamine that comes
from discovering a novel idea write it
down refine that idea and post it to
your profile this is just one huge
content hack in general is sharing what
excites you when you read something
that's what you're hunting for right and
this is modern hunting is you finding
something new it exciting you and you
being like I need to share this with
someone else because that's how you
track the people that are interested in
the same thing as you so you need to
capture that's the first step in value
creation is capturing an idea so that
you can make it your own and give it to
someone after learning with intention
comes building for yourself so pursue
your goals and document the process by
document I mean to keep running notes
logs successes and failures somewhere
safe physical or digital from your
journey you gain a knowledge of 100 from
that you can create a path of one this
is how you pass down a unique system
that markets itself and gets better
results than those looking to make a
quick Buck along the way post the advice
lessons and authentic successes and
failures you've experienced this is
called building in public don't do it
for others do it as a digital Journal it
will pay off so after building for
yourself comes Distributing a purposeful
product most people don't realize that
products are Authority catalysts they
think they are selling out by selling a
product but don't realize that it adds
perceived authority to their brand and
they gain more loyal followers create a
product that you need or needed in your
life something that would have helped
you achieve where you are now or
something that will help you achieve
something faster this can be closed for
style courses for knowledge a journal
for productivity or anything in between
sell to yourself and you won't have to
worry about competition another thing
that people get wrong here is that they
rely too much on the algorithm or looks
and they start playing that game rather
than building something for themselves
that is innately valuable because you've
already validated it and how you use it
and if it's actually helped your life
and then Distributing that to other
people because you know it will help
other people if you don't feel like a
sellout by building something for
yourself that's actually helping your
life and you enjoy you shouldn't feel
like one if you're giving it to someone
else that just shows that you have more
inner work to do or you need to have a
perspective shift around money now we
need to talk about customer creation
through education and why education
businesses are so important and why
almost every business can benefit from
adding a layer of Education to their
business so that they create customers
create remember that create customers I
don't agree with 99 of business gurus
out there most of the hyper successful
ones are old and out of touch most of
the young ones never question what the
old ones say and Forge A New Path it is
common advice to build a product for a
starving market then attract that market
as your audience yes obviously this
works but it also comes with the
downsides of hating your customer base
and not feeling motivated to work second
not having autonomy over what you write
and build third not being able to Pivot
into whatever topic or interest you are
curious about and fourth being forced
into a specific identity which spills
over into the entirety of your life when
you prioritize education in your brand
through courses content cohorts and
coaching all of them being optional you
unlock the ability to create your own
customers but how and why first thing is
that humans are learning machines why
does a starving Market desire what they
desire why are they willing to pull out
their credit credit card and pay for
something they perceive as valuable why
are you told to Niche down so you can
get specific on the problem you leverage
in your marketing because of social
conditioning learning and education you
target a specific person because they
are educated to have that identity
before they even come across your brand
people are educated to a specific point
to wanting to buy something right and so
this is what most marketers are trying
to do is they're trying to incept
someone at a specific level of Education
rather than attracting the a much
broader Market at the bottom and
educating them into the specific and
hopefully holistic and purposeful
worldview that they are putting across
in order to sell their products so
you're extending the journey and the
nurturing of the customer or just reader
that you have you're changing their life
on a much deeper level because you're
guiding them through the entire
actualization Journey so in terms of
identity and incepting them what most
marketers do is incepting them at a
specific level of Education their
identity influences what they desire
because of who they surround themselves
with and what they see as opportunity
when you create identities through
education by Leading people towards your
vision through your narrative people
grow to desire the product that will
help them Reach that goal there is a
concept called the levels of awareness
that will change your life it is a
simple copywriting framework popularized
by Eugene Schwartz in his book
breakthrough advertising it doesn't only
apply to marketing but everything
evolution is about solving problems in
the macrocosm personal growth is about
solving problems in the microcosm
business is about solving problems to
bridge the gap between the two business
is your contribution to humanity it is
how you fill your life's purpose of
raising your Consciousness or awareness
and letting that impact the world like a
ripple in water there are five levels of
awareness the first is unaware so
they're unaware of the problem the
second is problem wear so they're aware
of the problem the third is solution
aware so they're aware of a solution to
the problem the fourth is product aware
so they're aware of your solution to the
problem the fifth is most aware they're
aware of the vast impact that problem is
having on their quality of life this is
where they're most ready to buy this is
where they're most educated on the
problems benefits goals and everything
else that relates to what they want in
life or the problem they want to solve
your job as an education brand is to hit
all of these you must make your audience
aware of the problems you solved in your
life and how that problem impacts their
life you must give advice lessons and
tips to show that there is a solution
you must Market a product that solves
the problem faster just by the nature of
invested attention people don't log on
to social media to solve their problems
it isn't a learning platform and most
people can't focus research and figure
out a path for themselves that is why
products are valuable because people
know they are investing in a solution
then their attention and behavior follow
suit free education only works for the
one percent that have been conditioned
to be motivated invaded and ambitious
even they still see the value in
aggregated information and will probably
buy out of convenience remember that
where it's like oh why isn't this
information available for free it is you
just aren't ambitious enough to go and
find it and do it for yourself people
that want to pay for something that is
convenient which you do at almost I
would argue every day if you order
something off of Amazon rather than
going to to the store to get it then you
have no business talking about free
versus paid content so in terms of the
levels of awareness we also need to
understand the delicate balance of short
form and long-form writing or content
for the uninitiated there are two main
types of content and communication the
first is long form so podcasts videos
articles newsletters conversations
movies and sometimes long social posts
like threads and then second is short
form so tweets shorts reels texts emails
Big Ideas and your favorite quotes each
has its pros and cons but long term they
are both necessary to build an audience
that trusts you trust is the new sales
hack that people are starting to catch
on to short form is for capturing
attention building a large audience and
funneling that audience to deeper
sources of value like long-form
platforms products and services this is
the one thing that I realized when I was
first starting on YouTube is that I
wasn't growing very fast one because I
didn't understand YouTube sure my
content game wasn't that good but then I
got on something like Twitter now x i
so so stupid why'd they change the name
whatever but once I started seeing how
much easier it was to grow on the short
form platforms just by understanding how
content was shared and being able to be
polarized and confident and just good
ideas in a short amount of time without
investing so much in like a 10 to 20
minute YouTube video that goes nowhere I
could build a large audience I realized
that and eventually I could funnel it
into YouTube because that's what I
wanted to do down the road so my path to
get what I wanted changed when I gained
more experience and understood the
social media game more and so now we'll
go over what you should do in this case
so that's short form but long form is
for holding invested attention
segmenting your audience and building
trust through expertise the balance of
both forces you to have value to deliver
if you don't have a habit of
self-education building products or
systems and using writing as a way to
clarify your thoughts and ideas you are
delaying the inevitable you need to
build something my best content came
from when I was either building a
product writing my book or just having a
lens to view everyday experiences from
and extract the lesson related to that
thing if you don't have a project or
something to build or just a goal to
apply what you are learning too all of
the information going into your mind is
noise you're not able to filter out the
signal by having a frame of reference
for that which you're trying to apply it
to so you need that balance of
self-education and building if you're
not doing either or you're building for
someone else and they've assigned you
projects that you don't care to learn
about those two things have to match you
have to build your own thing and learn
your own thing and that's how you create
this flow of information that makes life
meaningful I am aware that most of my
readers are beginners for you I
recommend starting with one long form
Channel and one short form eventually
when you do this full time and systemize
your process you can repurpose those to
all platforms for long form I recommend
a newsletter first why one you can
practice when nobody is watching two you
can build a database of content to
repurpose into blogs YouTube and solo
podcasts three long form builds depth
and connection with your audience so you
don't have to rely on pushy sales
tactics to make a living four you are
forced to develop original ideas that
spill over into your short form content
for short form I recommend a writing
platform like X why you don't have to
show your face or body having a headshot
as your profile picture helps of course
you learn to monetize your mind instead
of your looks your income depends on
your creativity you can test multiple
ideas each day and repurpose your best
ones to other platforms like Instagram
and Linkedin to grow faster you can use
your writing as scripts for shorts reels
and tick tocks I teach this entire
process into a writer start with 30
minutes of writing each morning write a
long form newsletter use the ideas you
write about as short form posts
eventually let your engagement data act
as a compass for what you write more
about so you understand the importance
of content and education but you have a
one hundred thousand dollar product
trapped in your head and I made a video
about this previously literally called
you have a hundred thousand dollars
trapped in your head or in your brain
whatever it is you can look that up or
go to the one person business playlist
but first let's handle the prime
objection of information products in
general it's not real it's not tangible
it's just words on a screen if the root
of your existence and quality of life is
your mind and your mind is an
information processing machine and the
information you consume heavily
influences where you end up in life in
the people's lives you impact
information products are the greatest
product one can sell anyone who tells
you otherwise has not thought it through
or experienced the business model
they're conditioned by their favorite
guru's world view and can't escape it I
am moving toward the belief that every
single business should have a foundation
of Education every single business
should have an information product to
distribute positive behavior change at
scale not to mention the fact that they
have a 95 plus profit margin is a sign
that the economy will continue to favor
the education Market to technology and
evolution have led us to this point and
who are you to question mother nature
but Dan how do I eliminate competition
and saturation build a product for your
past self or current self one that
accelerates the progress made toward a
meaningful goal your marketing will
revolve around the universal principle
of human behavior which is purpose path
and priority purpose being a compelling
reason to move toward a better future
path a process system or steps that
bring Clarity to their actions and
priority the burning problem they face
at their level of awareness this is
everything purpose path priority this is
an entire section of my book but it is a
principle that applies to everything
human behavior related people buying a
product is human behavior right you need
a problem you need a goal and you need
to bounce between the two your product
is the path that helps them get from one
to another from point A to point B
that's what people buy think of all the
products you bought and if you can apply
that principle then you know is a good
product if you like productive activity
create a workflow with education around
that if you like spirituality create
meditations and education around that if
you like Fitness create a program with
education around that you can't improve
what doesn't exist so don't stress the
first iteration this is a long game of
improvement but Dan what about my
customer Avatar and market research it's
you you are the niche you are the
customer Avatar write the content and
promotions that would speak to you there
are a lot of moving pieces to this it
will take a year or so to actually feel
like you're getting the hang of it but
don't make the mistake in thinking that
this is a unique case every single thing
you've done in life has been a process
of trial and error just because you are
older and have psychological barriers
built up doesn't mean you can't build a
business like you learn to walk that's
it for this one I hope that last line
hit hard because learning to walk is
arguably the hardest skill we've learned
in our lives and up until this point
we've just adopted all of these
psychological barriers these limiting
beliefs that prevent us from thinking
that everything is just as easy as
learning to walk we look back and it's
like I don't even remember learning to
walk but I can walk just fine me 10
years ago had no idea how to build a
business now I could probably spin one
up and make however much money I wanted
in the course of a year if I did things
right of course but that's it for this
