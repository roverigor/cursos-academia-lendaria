i was a boy scout when i was a kid i
would go every week to my church stand
with my fellow scouts put up the
three-finger
salute and
recite the scout oath
and swear my allegiance in a sense not
really to
uh the the scouting philosophy as a
whole and every
um every year we would go on one big
camping trip every month we'd go on like
many camping trips maybe like a weekend
at a time but every year we would do
something big sometimes we went to
moab utah and we'd
do mountain biking we did rappelling we
would
sit at this campsite with everyone else
we'd go to the lunch hall have some
lunch just a bunch of young kids having
a great time in the great outdoors and
we even went white water rafting
sometimes but i want to talk about one
specific trip that we went on to
catalina island now
this trip started out like any other we
drove to california from arizona and it
was funny we drove in my dad's truck at
the time and being young creative kids
we loved playing video games so what we
did was we took our tv out of our room
put it in the middle of the truck and
like separating the back seat from the
front seat in that little
area where the middle seat would
normally go we hooked up the xbox to a
like portable power charger inside the
car and we just played halo the entire
time we played halo 3. um forget exactly
what the game mode was called but it's
like survival where you get rounds of
monsters coming at you and you continue
defeating them and we played that in the
entire time but eventually we got to
california we got to the harbor or the
dock that we were supposed to ferry over
to catalina island and so when we got on
the ferry while everyone else was
drinking like bloody marys having a good
time we were playing
cards just in the corner i went and i
remember getting a virgin pina colada as
a kid and i thought it was so fancy
having this
pseudo-alcoholic beverage and trying to
be like the the
other people that we were surrounded
with but we ended up getting to catalina
island a bit late right
and we immediately had to go from the
ferry to the kayak rental place because
we planned on going around the entire
island
and camping at different beachfronts
there so we immediately got off the the
ferry we got all of our bags we strapped
them to the kayaks we got in the kayaks
we were in a rush to get out we ended up
getting out on the lake or the the
ocean i guess you could say and we took
off and for about the first hour or two
perfectly fine beautiful waters we even
saw like some dolphins come up and swim
next to us i don't remember if they were
dolphins or seals but either way
wildlife it was it was pretty cool to
see as a young kid and experience these
things but
eventually a storm started closing in
and just long story short the storm hit
us hard it was raining the waves grew to
at least
not exaggerating here at least like
10 feet in difference they were big
waves of course but
we flipped so many times at the bottom
of the waves we couldn't see
everyone because we got so split up so
when we would get to the top of the wave
we would see our scout leaders in front
of us and we would see their the orange
part of their oars
and we were slowly losing hope because
the people behind us we couldn't even
see them anymore we flipped my bag fell
off we're dying we gave up multiple
times we just put ours down and we're
like just take us like throw us into the
side of the thing we're we're done
and then other times we got filled with
this inspiration when we were towards
the top and we're like oh we're closing
in on the scout leaders it's time to go
and we'd
go through a mini phase of intensity
and just try to catch up and it was a
cycle of going fast going slow giving up
losing hope thinking we're gonna make it
and all of these highs and lows that
emulate a very good story in a sense and
so
we eventually after maybe two three
hours in this storm it was a terrible
time like i truly thought i was going to
i thought my life was going to end at
that point in time and eventually we saw
the shore and so that gave us a huge
burst of inspiration right that's the
breakthrough point that so many
successful people talk about where you
go through all this trial and error for
so long but eventually you get to this
point where you see the you see the
short you have that breakthrough you're
like okay yeah i can actually do this
and so we were paddling as hard as we
 could and eventually crashed
onto the shore just rolled out of our
kayaks laid in the sun
shivering like freaking out because it
was freezing and eventually being
revitalized and there's a lot more to
that story the people that fell behind
ended up getting brought to us by i
don't think it was coast guard but um
like the security people that were
navigating that storm
uh all of my food got soaked and when i
woke up in the morning because we left
our clothes to dry out
all my food was eaten by birds and just
thrown across the entire campsite so
that was fun
so as with everything i want i'm using
this story to paint a
life concept something that always
happens and that is the cycles of life
or the waves of life the high highs and
the low lows so here's a graphic as we
do in every video but
life comes at you in waves so you can
see here that there are multiple things
i want you to pay attention to there's
the present and then there's the future
and you could probably even imagine the
waves of your life
prior to this moment and that those are
some things that you remember in your
life and can tap back into but in the
present there's the highs the lows the
inevitable cycles of life that nature
provides that storm we couldn't control
that storm what what's going to happen
right and the thing here is in that
graph there's the separation of the
inevitable waves of life and a mindful
response to those waves of life because
as you are going up this high your
mind has the ability to take a step back
and become aware that you are in this
cycle of life and you do not your
emotions do not have to match those
waves you do not have to go deep into a
specific wave of life and allow yourself
to just lose yourself in that moment and
a quote by alan watts that i absolutely
love and may not make sense to a lot of
people until you directly experience it
regarding hot and cold weather uh is
you're out in the cold you start
shivering why
because you're resisting the cold you
are tightening your muscles against the
cold and you get the staggers take it
easy go with the cold relax
from alan watts and one way that i like
to paint this is a sauna right
think of the sauna as like a struggle
in your life a period in your life where
you are being
put in the furnace of life to be refined
by it so
and learn the lesson from it because
when you go in asana it's intentional
right i know it's going to be hot in
there and if it were at any other time
where i wasn't expecting it or i wasn't
intentional with it or i wasn't mindful
of it if i walk out
outside and i'm complaining about the
heat the entire time
yeah i'm gonna get upset but you don't
get upset in asana you go in the sauna
it's hot you know it's gonna be hot and
you calm down and you let it do what
it's supposed to do you let life teach
you the lesson it's supposed to teach
you now in classical mechanics there is
something called a harmonic oscillator
the 80 20 of this is that it tries to
maintain equilibrium right so if it goes
low it tries to return back to
equilibrium but it displaces in
the opposite way so when it hits a low
there's an inevitable but somewhat equal
high and it continues going until it
reaches back at equilibrium and that's
the picture i want to paint here because
our mind is a harmonic oscillator there
are aspects of life that you cannot
control now i also want to mention that
our mind is a complex
set of systems right and if you
understand systems you understand that
they make decisions through positive and
negative feedback and that can be
conditioned over time that's what makes
a good system right if you have a high
high in life and you register as
positive feedback you're going to want
to reach that high again but per the
harmonic oscillator or just the
inevitable waves
something is there's a counter force if
you're pursuing those high highs and you
consistently want let's say that cheap
dopamine or those distractions and you
wonder why you're consistently going
into a low phase of life that is why
especially when you are not mindful of
it now if these phases do or do not
affect you
specifically do not affect you then
congratulations you are
um
separating
an entity emotion from your being and
becoming aware of that and being able to
navigate it without having it negatively
impact your life but it also
brings up the topic of being able to
rewire or reprogram or recondition
your mind
for
more beneficial outcomes in your life
and specifically being able to navigate
the negative aspects or what you
perceive as negative aspects which are
in fact inevitable aspects of life now
if you want to reinvent yourself or you
want to change yourself or your life you
need to change your identity
why because think of it a healthy person
does not
think of healthy eating as a chore it's
enjoyable to them they find a deep
satisfaction in that because it is a
part of their consciously created
identity right they enjoy eating an
apple over say a cookie now enjoyment is
different from pleasure right by eating
an apple and understanding the depth and
the consciousness beyond that
and how it impacts every aspect of your
body right you are expanding your
consciousness here rather than just like
i want that shallow
uh
surface level
dopamine pleasure hit instead of diving
deep what are the impacts of this apple
think beyond the apple
think beyond the apple what made the
apple can you gain deeper appreciation
for it where did this apple come from
what was the process for getting it to
the store
what who was impacted by it who created
it is it causing suffering to actually
produce this apple what about when i put
it into my body what is it doing to my
body do i have to learn about my body in
order to do these things do i have to
break out of this unconscious life that
i'm going through and actually learn
something for once and expand my
awareness and consciousness to the point
of deep appreciation for the things that
are conducive to my growth now
changing yourself is not as simple as it
sounds by any means um it is not simple
it takes a long time it takes years of
reconditioning because it's taken you 18
25 30 40 maybe years to be conditioned
into this current life that you're
living and you're expecting to change at
a moment's notice and recondition
all of those unconscious patterns that
you aren't even aware of
within
a week or something and this this stems
towards everything if you're overweight
and it's taken you 40 years to put on
all of that weight and all of the
unconscious thought patterns and habits
that come along with that and you expect
to change because
like in a week or in a month and you
want to lose 20 30 pounds or the love
handles in x amount of time when it's
you're chasing the surface level
dopamine hit again you're not thinking
of the depth and the long-term impacts
and everything else
regarding that that will help you create
a new identity and create a healthy
lifestyle for yourself this isn't a
three-month process of creating a better
life for yourself just to go back you
have to dive deep and you have to
form an identity with building blocks
that only come from seeing past the
surface now i want you to think of a
city in this because cities are
constructed right they are in essence a
system that is constructed and
conditioned over time whether or not
it's built on a solid foundation right
and so removing let's say your mind or
your identity is this construction it is
a city now if you were to take down city
hall
the entire city would that it wouldn't
know how to operate right it wouldn't
make sense and then you trying to change
that aspect of your life without being
able to navigate the low that is going
to come with it because you're at a high
or you remove the city hall from your
metaphorical city and you hit a new low
and then the harmonic oscillator is
going to bring you back to a high and
then to a low and eventually equilibrium
but again you have to be aware of that
and be able to navigate that so that is
one the first step is a mindful approach
to all of this but the second is
understanding so thinking of your
identity as a city and i want to
i want you to think of it as seattle
washington in particular in
1889 a glue pot
tipped over and nearly burned down a
majority of the city why
because aside from the person
that tried to pour water on the flaming
glue that was spilled over and making it
spread because
glue spreads with water
the city itself was built on a terrible
foundation the the construction of the
city itself sucked there was
wooden sewer pipes like blocks like
th this was their sewage right think of
a
sewer pipe that is made out of blocks of
wood that are
like transferring all of our bodily
disposals into the sewage or whatever it
may be there's a bunch of other things
there was like crappy foundations it was
a poorly built city and it led to its
inevitable demise of being
burned to the ground now seattle
modern-day seattle is
much more it's built on a better
foundation it is built in a better way
it is built in a way that functions as a
cohesive whole there are better streets
to navigate there are ways to get from
point a to point b to make those
connections in your mind as we are
making this connection to our mind but
this paints a picture of our mind when
something burns down in the collective
or everyone there uh
freaks out and it's like oh what are we
gonna do we need to call the police and
we need to get the fire thing and
everyone's freaking out in a state of
negativity and now this is granted
and i don't you expect to be super
mindful or calm during a situation like
that but the point is this our brain is
our psyche is wired for survival we have
the brains of our ancestors but we're
living in this modern world and it is
difficult to navigate and survive that
world because when something is
threatened let's say our identity it's
not
it's not the same as what our ancestors
were threatened by right now it's our
beliefs and it's other things and it's
all of these things that we're exposed
to that threaten our survival and cause
us to go into that low period of life
whether it's macro or micro right
whether it's a week long or it's five
seconds long and we're thrown into fight
or flight and all those stress hormones
fill our body and
we don't know how to navigate that even
though there is no real threat there is
no real threat and when you pull when
you try to change your identity by
pulling a piece of your city out
it's going to cause that survival
response where you're going to be put
into fight or flight you're going to go
into a low period you're going to fight
with it quite a bit then we could bring
up quotes about don't fight with it flow
with it be mindful whatever it may be
but you need to understand this before
you start to actually change yourself
and your identity along with it because
when you pull out a piece of the city
which part are you pulling out first are
you pulling out the heart which is going
to send you into a
very low period of life that you may not
be able to navigate or are you going to
have to do it step by step
and take out the small pieces replace
them take out what you're directly
conscious of right now and work to
repair it over time
there is a dynamic and balance to be had
with that now with that there are two
routes to reinvent yourself and i've
actually made a video on one of those
routes before and that kind of acts as a
primer to this because
the first step or the first option to
reinventing yourself is hitting rock
bottom it's trying to change and uh
change one of the foundational pillars
of the city you've built of your
identity
getting kind of pissed at yourself and
changing it right because a lot of the
people that have hit some form of rock
bottom at their life and decided to turn
it around immediately that is more than
a possibility but it also comes with a
very low period that you have to bounce
back out of and then become mindful as
the harmonic oscillator is returning to
equilibrium or as your psyche is trying
to maintain homeostasis because that's
the thing
with this whole hitting rock bottom
you
are
in essence just becoming directly
conscious
of all of the things that are causing
whatever it may be that is causing you
surface level pain right because you are
in essence you you do something let's
say i can't come up with an example for
this but you
okay maybe i do you get broken up with
by your girlfriend that's usually with
young dudes that's usually like what
causes them to start going to the gym
and start doing all this other stuff to
work on themselves because that breakup
that they were so attached to and was a
part of their identity caused them to go
into this low point of life it made them
directly aware of what they had to do
which was
improve themselves so they can survive
survive in the dating market in the
future and not end up alone which is a
biological
need so now there is a better option a
more sustainable option and that is
stacking small
wins or as some people put it uh
building a portfolio of small bets or
um
alan watts says gambling on yourself or
james clear says one percent better
every day now rather than attacking the
absolute foundation of the city that
you've built over time again think of it
think of it like ancient rome right
where ancient rome
got destroyed there is an ancient rome
and there's a new rome and ancient rome
wasn't as
sturdy as new rome and so you are in
essence slowly taking down
new rome while also building up i mean
slowly taking down ancient rome while
slowly building up new rome at it can be
the same or it can be different and so
you are attacking these buildings
in your identity that aren't necessarily
going to cause you a ton of pain you
aren't attacking the foundation at first
because you have to slowly peel back the
layers because that's how this stuff
happens it's layers upon layers it's
systems
in your head that are becoming hardwired
over time and once a system
is
completed or it is conditioned enough to
know this is the thought pattern that
you need to take it becomes habit it can
become unconscious all of that stuff so
you need to slowly peel back and start
to solve the problems that you are
directly aware of right now that is how
you do it right that is how you become
aware of things in general is to
question right if something happens and
you do not like it
why
question don't just let it be don't just
let it be unconscious and you continue
to go about that and wonder oh why is
this all happening to me it's because
you're not aware of what's actually
causing it it's cause and effect if you
are directly aware of the effect but you
aren't directly aware of the cause this
is a law of the universe by the way
cause and effect you become aware of the
effect which could be negative
in your perception now why what is the
cause and now the cause is much deeper
than you will be aware of at first but
you need to slowly peel back until you
reach that right so you become you start
solving these surface level problems so
let's say the breakup example and you
start going to the gym a lot of people
do it for vanity but eventually it
becomes very passionate to them because
they see the depth in it they appreciate
it for what it is they appreciate the
mechanics in learning how to lift
weights they appreciate
being able to make progress and see
strength gains and the survival
mechanism of their brain rewarding that
with dopamine because they are making
progress by pursuing their own goals so
i had a tweet on this and my tweet said
that may be understood by some people
but now it should make sense is that if
you don't know what you want understand
what you don't want and work in the
opposite direction so you it negativity
bias right it is extremely easy to
become aware of the things you don't
want in life because you don't know what
you want until you've experienced it you
don't know if you truly want something
until you've experienced it so you can
base your problem solving off of the
things that you have already experienced
and you know you don't want right so
let's say you are out and about and you
are walking down the street and you make
eye contact with someone and something
happens in you and you're like oh like i
no i didn't like that and so it's like
okay how do i start learning about this
and this comes in developmental stages
and you have to be aware of this so what
most people do then they'll watch a
youtube video on how to be confident and
that will give them some good
information it will help them start
solving the problems but then as you
become more and more aware and realize
what it is not then you can start to
work towards what it is and start
stacking these small wins and seeing the
progress that comes from growth where
when you're in the gym you get in there
because of shallow vanity purposes and
you start lifting you start gaining a
deeper appreciation for it you start
becoming aware of what that problem
actually was which could have been like
a vanity issue or a self-esteem issue
and now you can start to go down that
pathway and slowly fix it through
self-education questioning pursuing your
curiosity and everything else we've
talked about in the past
10 or so videos now another thing that
you should do and one of the pillars in
my entire philosophy is create a vision
for your future i have a video on that
but just kind of assuming what you want
or outlining what you want and becoming
very clear on what you think you want
will allow you to
connect the things that you are learning
as you are solving your problems right
when you are solving your own problems
you become aware of certain things but
you become aware and directly conscious
of more
when you have a vision goals priorities
to actually apply that to because that's
the other thing is when you become aware
of these problems from
determining what you don't want and
you're working in the opposite direction
towards a vision
you need to understand what priority
task you are doing right now in order to
solve that problem for good
in alignment with your vision because
you could solve it in a completely
different way but if it's not like aimed
in the right direction you're not
stacking these small wins
up vertically rather than to the side
where it's just going to fall down again
then you just need to take that into
account now this is not an easy process
you are
in a kayak going through a storm or
you're on easy waters right now but the
storm is eventually going to come and
it's going to be inevitable and since we
are in a period of
life
where it's kind of like 5th century bc
where people are losing trust
in the externally ordered consciousness
or the external hierarchy of goals that
people have set for us that bring some
form of clarity to our life um it's it's
external clarity not internal clarity so
there's a ton of ideas there's an
abundant abundance of information ideas
it's very easy to get lost in the weeds
and especially as people are losing
trust in corporate culture just societal
constructs in general
it's
difficult to navigate because
that means that you have to actively
construct your life
a religious organization or corporations
or corporate culture or your job or the
school system can only teach you so much
and it will only lead to so much and it
can only provide certainty and clarity
for a certain amount of time and even if
you don't align with those things they
are external they aren't your own right
you need to create your own rules your
own values your own vision your own
mission your own
anything that will bring clarity to your
life and how you make sense of this
world because that's all other people
are doing is they're giving you
perspectives they're giving you lenses
to see the world from and that is not
your lens you have to create your own
lens in order
operate in a conducive manner that will
lead to beneficial outcomes in your life
and this comes with time and practice
and refinement and iteration and as long
as you stay on the path and are
consistent persistent and all of those
other things that everyone tells you to
do but you're not doing
that is how you do all of this now i
have found a lot of power in viewing
all of my
parts of life
as a scientific project or a science
project because that's all life is it
all follows the scientific method you
observe something okay you become
directly aware of it you experiment with
it you hypothesize how you can fix that
problem you eventually
test processes that will help you
overcome that problem you develop these
systems in your mind and possibly
physically that will allow you to
navigate that problem better in the
future and once that gets replicable
results you're like okay i'm getting
some good data from this this makes
sense for other people to follow and you
can either pass that down and monetize
that process via a personal brand like
creators are doing or
you just
start to develop a better way of living
so one thing you can do is to one buy a
notebook write my scientific
projects on it and now map out
mind body spirit finances or other
categories of your life that you are
searching to improve and now your
observations you can put in here right
the things you become aware of the
problems you become aware of and that
you plan to fix you can write them in
you can write out how you plan to solve
it you can write out your findings and
what
stemmed from you trying to solve it you
can write down steps for overcoming that
problem you can test those steps and
this is lifestyle design as a whole the
concept of lifestyle design and being
able to design a life of your own doing
and being able to solve your problems
because think of it if you're like okay
here's a problem but i'm unable to solve
it because i don't have enough time
because i'm in a job that doesn't allow
much autonomy so that stems another
problem how do we solve it well you can
search for another job you can increase
your skill set you can
start a business you can do something
that will allow that other problem to be
solved until you have full control and
freedom over your life so that is it for
