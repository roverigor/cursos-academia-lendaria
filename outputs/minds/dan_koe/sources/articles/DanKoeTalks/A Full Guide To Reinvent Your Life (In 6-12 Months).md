life is like a dark room on occasion we
find a candle so that we can see but not
for long the candle provides vision and
Direction but the flame will die out
sparking fear and our souls that we will
never find our way unless we move with
faith that we will find the next candle
the human mind bounces between order and
chaos chaos is our default State Clarity
is the byproduct of ordered information
that fills our Consciousness our mind is
clear when what we pay attention to is
clear this is an explanation for human
behavior and it explains why people
report that the most miserable part of
their lives are on a Sunday between the
times of 10 a.m and 2 pm when they have
nothing to do people say that they hate
their jobs yet jobs provide a clear
state of mind that is arguably much more
enjoyable than being at home alone with
your thoughts humans fill their days
with activities that structure their
mind we always want to be doing
something seeing people playing games
right designing creating preferably
investing our attention in something
useful and when we are alone psychic
entropy ensues and so entropy is that
everything tends towards disorder like
how one day you will die one day the sun
will die out one day the universe will
die and you can see that anything
tangible will eventually decompose and
that is unless we as humans attempt to
reverse entropy that's all we're really
doing here is trying to solve the
problems that lead to things falling
apart we're trying to extend our life on
this Earth everything even something as
small as organizing your bookshelf after
it gets dirty is with the larger
survival goal in the back of your mind
of I need to survive we need to live as
long as possible we need to become
immortal and that's what really everyone
is creating to do and so psychic entropy
is when we lose the frame or the order
of our mind by letting go of a coherent
line of thought and this happens more
than you think when we are sitting
around and without actually doing
anything when we're alone with our
thoughts we may have some structured
thoughts occasionally we may have a
coherent line of thought but eventually
that ends that lasts like two to three
seconds and then eventually you catch on
to a thought and then your thought
process goes unconscious and you can't
keep track of where your thoughts are
going to end up so our mind grasps at
negative thoughts and then they multiply
and so the cure to this state of mind
this unordered State of Mind feeling
lost overwhelmed and anxious is knowing
how to order your mind it is knowing how
to direct your attention meditation
teaches you to focus on your breath
metacognition teaches you to question
your thoughts learning to be alone is
learning to order your mind in any
circumstance for enjoyment and I think
it's ironic that people think they want
to maximize the freedom in their life
because that's the opposite of what they
want people don't want freedom they want
autonomy they don't want limitations
projected on them they want to create
their own limitations and so Clarity is
the key to enjoyment but enjoyment is
not the only p piece of the puzzle we
can enjoy a life that someone assigns to
us we can enjoy working a nine-to-five
job we can enjoy doing what people tell
us to do but at the end of the day that
does not bring fulfillment sustainable
long-term Clarity comes from two sources
one is self-generated goals in alignment
with a conscious future and two is
society generated goals in alignment
within unconscious future one is created
one is assigned if we don't want our
life to be the product of someone else's
Vision we must create our own let's dive
in most people don't need motivation
they need Clarity motivation is like
standing on one side of a canyon the
other side looks like a Utopia
everything you could ever want beautiful
people music cars houses all calling
your name to take the leap but you don't
have a way to get over to the other side
of the canyon Clarity is the first plank
of the bridge to the other side and
motivation can be illustrated by the
behavior molecule dopamine when
something is far away from us we desire
it more when we do not have it and when
we acquire that thing like a nice house
nice car nice watch a pretty person or
even something like an internet course
or a new book we feel good for a bit but
then it becomes normal it becomes a part
of our Lives it's not something that we
desire anymore because we've acquired it
and so we know this as the honeymoon
phase right when you want something so
so bad and then we finally get it
there's maybe a two week to four week
period where you are in love with that
thing and and not really in love but
more so infatuated with that thing and
now dopamine is not bad it is one of the
most important neurotransmitters to
understand in your life in how you
behave it is the drive behind your
dreams and that should be utilized but
most people drown in motivation and they
see so many things that are out of their
reach every single day especially on
social media and so over and over again
they waste this precious resource that
could be used to act on their dreams and
even if they do acquire those dreams
like their fancy car or a nice watch
they don't know how to swap their focus
to sustain the enjoyment of that thing
because while dopamine is more so raised
when you desire something that is
outside of you or something that you do
not have there are other
neurotransmitters that are called the
Here and Now neurotransmitters like
serotonin oxytocin endorphins and
endocannabinoids that give you
satisfaction and appreciation for what's
in front of you the things that you have
in your own personal space and so while
some people take drugs like Molly
marijuana even alcohol and I'm not
judging I do these things occasionally
too there are more sustainable ways to
bring this satisfaction fulfillment
enjoyment into your everyday life with
the things that you have to appreciate
where you are and who you are the first
is mindfulness and detail so with this
you're trying to notice the detail that
your senses can provide because most
people are living in this superficial
State they everything around them is
normal to them so when you go on a walk
try to see detail that you've never seen
before maybe it's in the trees and how
the leaves are so detailed or Bush that
you've ever you've never actually looked
too closely at or maybe even the
concrete under your feet we're trying to
snap out of the Mindless and normal
routines that keep us living on the
surface notice the extravagant details
in the leaves of a tree the blades of
grass and the shine of the light on cars
as they pass you by when you cook a meal
notice the differences in texture taste
and feel try to pick apart the
ingredients when listening to a song dig
deep can you hear the subtle layers in
the background those were intentional by
the Creator they want you to notice them
and so you can see why food critics
music lovers and yogis enjoy certain
activities so much it's because they're
so immersed in the present moment and
their mind is being flooded with the
Here and Now neurotransmitters which is
much more sustainable than constantly
pursuing that cheap dopamine hit and so
the mindfulness in detail is really us
just trying to get in touch with reality
because reality is an Ever flowing
quality of experience and we're missing
out on the depth of that experience
every single day and so you can apply
this strategy when you acquire something
new that is borderlining boredom right
because your Pursuits maybe you have
been pursuing this one thing so long
that when you get it and it's its shine
is starting to fade that if you don't
want to put it onto the Shelf you need
to learn how to enjoy it you need to
notice the detail in it far beyond just
your senses as well and that leads into
Point number two which is developing an
intrinsic philosophy so let's imagine a
young bodybuilder they started going to
the gym for vanity but they stayed for
the therapy they desired a strong
aesthetic physique so that they could
attract a partner in command respect but
after a year or two their progress
drastically slowed down they built a
great body so what's next it didn't
really change how many people they
attracted maybe it bumped them up the
social hierarchy a bit but for what a
bit more attention is it still worth
spending seven to eight hours a week on
this endeavor so they look inward what
has this brought to my life why do I
keep showing up every day where would I
have spent my time otherwise how has
this impacted the people I meet the
conversations I can have and the career
opportunities open to me they realize
that their material Pursuit was deeply
immaterial as are most but people glance
over that fact their Pursuit for better
gave them an identity that influenced
positive decisions it prevented them
from being like the Mindless masses who
pursue nothing so the lesson is this
it's better to pursue something
superficial than it is to do nothing
with your life you either learn what you
don't want so you can pursue what you
want or you find depth meaning and
spirituality along the way and so the
third thing here for how to practice
appreciation and satisfaction in the
moment is learning and education because
95 percent of people would scoff at
someone who purchases a new car like a
Porsche GT3 that's because they only see
the surface and they can't open their
mind to see that a person's life and
identity is more than just a snapshot of
that situation what if the person that
bought it was a mechanic what if they
derived a deep Satisfaction by digging
into the Machinery now what if the
average Joe made the same purchase but
they decided to learn something new they
can learn their way into a deeper
crevice of reality through education
they study the car's Parts history and
how to drive better they start visiting
the track and the car becomes a
consistent part of their lifestyle one
that brings enjoyment and flow they
construct a house of meaning under the
foundation of material most people keep
laying a foundation and never build
anything worth keeping with this
knowledge the key to the good life is a
disciplined balance between meaningful
dopamine sources and creating
satisfaction when you achieve those
goals so now we need to talk about
enjoyment versus pleasure and choosing
your dopamine sources wisely enjoyment
comes from investing attention pleasure
comes from spending attention
Investments are long-term purchases are
short-term enjoyment is process focused
pleasure is outcome focused enjoyment is
progress toward a long-term goal
pleasure is achieving a goal without
effort our goal is to maximize the
enjoyment in our everyday life that's
all anyone is trying to do but most
people don't zoom out to gain a
perspective that is distraction proof
while pursuing those goals they're so
narrow really focused on what can bring
pleasure right here and right now
literally the key to life is just
zooming out expanding your focus
expanding your mind collecting more
perspective the highest perspective is
the one that includes them all because
we don't want to get stuck scrolling
social media having meaningless sex in
more ways than physical and winning
arguments in the comments that lead to
absolutely nothing useful we want to act
on our goals build something beneficial
in reality and impact others in a way
that brings enjoyment into our lives and
so I talk a lot about having a vision
for the future why because at every
point in my life where I have made
substantial progress in a short period
of time while enjoying every second of
it I was hell-bent on actualizing a
vision for the future that I held in my
mind and people that have experienced
this same thing know this power and
that's why I write about it so much
because I want to understand it I want
to dissect it I want to piece together a
way for people to develop Vision in
their own lives so they can experience
that feeling and so one concept that
I've coined that has helped many is the
anti-vision in brief it's how you
realize what you don't want and does
this mean that you can get rid of the
things that you don't want immediately
no you can't just quit your job and move
out of your hometown if you've built an
entire house of responsibilities around
that there's more on the line than money
if you just quit your job be smart about
this this is a long-term game so to
create your anti-vision here's what we
have to do first is observe society as a
habit pay close attention to the people
around you in any situation why do they
do what they do what is it leading
towards are they somebody that you want
to be it could be as simple as observing
the groceries that people put in their
baskets or observing their body and
realizing that you don't want to end up
slow lifeless groggy all the time number
two is to reflect on your past what are
experiences that you never want to
experience again what were the lowest
lows of your life what caused them have
you done anything to prevent that from
happening again make this a conscious
practice in your life number three is to
make a list of things things that you
don't want pull out a notebook and get
specific this list should make you feel
uncomfortable keep this somewhere safe
and when something new comes to mind
which it will because not every single
idea is going to come to mind in the
span of 10 to 20 minutes as you're
writing this out it's going to come to
your mind over years and years and years
of experiencing the things that pop the
ideas into your head and you need
somewhere to write it down for this
number four is to realize where you will
be if you keep doing the same thing you
are your habits where will your life end
up if you have the same lifestyle in 10
years do you want that number five is to
transmute that energy into a passionate
Vision what will you have to learn build
and execute daily to avoid your
anti-vision and if you want to turn your
vision into a brand and your notes into
content so that you can build an
authentic and purposeful one-person
business and check out to our writer so
we just came up with your anti-vision
but now your vision your vision is your
frame it is what you hold in the back of
your mind to guide your daily actions it
is the lens from which you view your
goals and from your vision and your
goals those are the lens that help you
view and perceive daily situations so
that you can make better decisions it's
not about having long-term or short-term
Focus it's about having both zoom out
your life is a culmination of your
choices and if you want to make better
ones you must expand your mind
Consciousness and focus beyond your
worries so now that you've created a
specific anti-vision for your future
you've primed your mind for pattern
recognition so that you can spot
opportunities that will Aid in you
actualizing the vision for your future
or just realizing okay this is not what
I want to do I'm not going to put this
in my grocery basket because I'm only
now aware of it because I've realized
that this is damaging the health that I
want to have going into my vision for
the future and so yes it is helpful to
get even more specific on what you want
out of your future but your vision is
imaginary it's a vision right it should
be culminated over time and it's very
helpful to write things out and I would
encourage you do that to write out the
op opposite of your anti-vision because
your vision may not be strong yet your
vision gets strong over time as I said
not everything is going to come to mind
in the 10 to 20 minutes that you're
going to spend doing this that's
literally impossible it's going to
culminate and expand and develop over
years and years and years of
experiencing life failing succeeding and
having data points from which to iterate
on your vision so now that we have a
vision for the future we need to learn
how to learn and build because schools
can't and won't teach you how to build
your dreams schools are intimately
connected with the government politics
and economy and their conditioning
process or education is set up to keep
these things going to keep them alive
anything that gives the individual power
is a threat so self-education is a
requirement on your journey and it's
obvious that you can't reach your goals
at your current level of development or
else you'd already achieve them you need
to develop skills you need to build
things you need to fail you need to gain
experience because it also wouldn't be
challenging if you could achieve your
goals right now it wouldn't be
challenging and challenge challenge
gives you a place to focus and order
your mind that's what makes life
enjoyable because challenge plays a
crucial role in The Flow State enjoyment
and dopamine but only if you take on
challenges that aren't too boring or
difficult play at your level but try to
make it to the next level and if you
want to retain everything that you learn
or at least the important things not the
noise you can't learn literally
everything that comes across your mind
you you must remember the important
things that actualize your vision that's
how you learn everything and if you want
to do that then you must learn as you
build or build as you learn so here's
what you do first is to write down 10 to
20 specific skills interests or topics
that will actualize your vision because
we need Clarity on what to do every
single day to actualize that Vision most
people fail to make tangible progress
because they don't realize that a
lifelong habit of Education skill
acquisition and practice is how you
build a better life this is not optional
if you don't have time carved out each
day to practice your craft for life then
you aren't going to make it anywhere
meaningful life itself is a practice and
most people aren't showing up they sit
at home and distract themselves with
Mindless entertainment you don't have
your ideal lifestyle because you aren't
living that lifestyle right now but on a
smaller scale as you get better at what
you do the time you spend doing it will
increase and the impact of what you're
doing will be more in less time and
money will become inevitable if you're
starting as a designer or a writer then
you're going to design or write for an
hour day every single morning as you get
better you're going to be able to do the
same amount of work that took that one
hour in 20 minutes and so not only are
you doing better and more work within
that first hour but you're able to
incorporate other things and start to
build let's say a business for it and
slowly increase the time you spend doing
it until it becomes your lifestyle the
same goes for the gym the same goes for
every single healthy habit that's the
successful people do on a daily basis
they didn't just poof land into this
lifestyle after they had a successful
business it was their lifestyle that
that allowed them to build the business
and so the key to all of this is
specificity don't write down web design
for one of your Curiosities or interests
that you're looking to write down here
write down how to create landing pages
that are actually useful to businesses
don't write down the gym write down diet
and training principles to lose 10
pounds of fat in six weeks do this 10
times minimum and if you don't see how
the skills interests or Curiosities Aid
in Your Vision then remove them so step
two after writing down 10 to 20
interests we're going to leverage
dopamine through pattern recognition and
momentum connecting ideas and noting
patterns in reality raises dopamine
levels in the brain it's the same reason
that cocaine feels so good dopamine but
this is much more sustainable it is
addictive and this process becomes more
powerful when you build momentum think
of it like doing a Sudoku puzzle you
come up with one answer to fill in and
dopamine increases and what that does is
it Narrows your mind with that feedback
to find other answers so once you find
one answer then you're like oh there's
one more oh there's another one and you
build momentum and the dopamine
continues to increase and it feels good
and it keeps you engaged and so the same
thing happens when you have an idea at
night and you're like that's a great
idea I need to write that down and then
you have another one and then another
one and you have 10 ideas that you have
no idea what to do with aside from write
down and keep them safe for the morning
when you're going to go and do Focus
work and so when you notice one idea
that connects to your vision your signal
to noise ratio increases and this
happens when you're studying your
interests and Curiosities so your
attention Narrows on more relevant
information not only on the things that
you're reading or watching or listening
to but also the ones that were already
in your mind and so your mind lights up
with excitement and your vision just
grows that much stronger and this is why
it feels so good to live with purpose so
that was step number two is leveraging
dopamine and pattern recognition step
number three is to learn and build that
way you eliminate useless information
because everyone is telling you what to
do they're projecting what they deem
important onto you what they see as
Sigma all but what to you is 95 percent
of the time noise and if you aren't
where you want to be in your life then
nothing is as important as your own
goals not the news not your friends
relationship problems and definitely not
who's getting elected and so on the
election part I always find it funny
that people get so up in arms about like
gas prices or whether or not they can
have a baby and it's don't get me wrong
there like I understand that it's your
body your choice or whatever it is I can
go either way I see both perspectives
right as I said earlier the highest
perspective is all perspectives and
being able to hold both of those in pull
truth what I'm saying here is that most
people hide behind the fact that it's
easier to submit a vote than it is to
change your life they can't zoom out and
see another way that is more effective
to bring their beliefs into reality than
by submitting a vote because if you're
worried about gas prices then why
haven't you zoomed out and developed a
strategy or a plan to build a business
so that you never have to worry about
gas prices again that is 10 times more
powerful not only for your life but for
other people's lives and not having to
rely on one measly vote that may not
even get counted and again if you zoom
out you can build an audience and
present your perspective to Millions so
that you actually have an impact on the
votes about your bodily rights or
whatever it may be that's how they keep
you locked into this thing is by keeping
your vision your your focus narrowed in
on their vision for what they want
rather than you zooming out and crafting
a plan to find a better way to getting
what you want I don't care what your
beliefs are on your bodily rights or
whatever you want to do if you want it
to become reality then take it into your
hands as much as you can develop a
vision for the future and actualize that
by yourself take control of it and
forget about the things that you have
very little control over so to create
you need boundaries for your creativity
or else things get too chaotic and
overwhelming you need goals turned into
projects so that you have something
tangible to work on and the goals and
projects provide boundaries for your
learning and creativity so break down
your vision into goals now yearly
monthly weekly daily turn all of those
into milestones for a project that you
can work on like a personal brand which
is the fuel for anything you want to
build or a one-person business which is
the starting point that I believe 99 of
people should start with before trying
to go after any other business model
because it's something that is holistic
and it evolves with you and it's not a
static business model that sounds too
good to be true so with your vision in
mind start building and learning work on
your project daily regardless of if you
know what you're doing because you don't
know what you're doing because you
haven't registered that as a problem or
actually started the project and hit a
problem that makes you realize oh this
is what I need to learn and you're never
going to find that if you don't start
you can learn you can be an expert at
something in the books but if you don't
actually do it you're going to hit the
same problem as if you knew nothing and
then you're gonna have to go and
research that problem anyway so it's
better to start then learn because that
is the best way to learn is to encounter
a real world problem research specific
information to solve it keep a steady
flow of information from your
consumption solve the problem enjoy the
dopamine and let momentum carry you into
season of intensity the rest is in your
hands that's it for this video check out
