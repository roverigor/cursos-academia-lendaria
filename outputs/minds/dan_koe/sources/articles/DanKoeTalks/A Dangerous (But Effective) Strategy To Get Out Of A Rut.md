I was thinking earlier this week and I
realized that the best decisions that
I've made in my life are the ones that
other people think are stupid in 2018 I
wasted my life savings and maxed out my
first credit card in hopes that my
dreams of building a massive e-commerce
business would work in 2019 I got rid of
everything I owned because of the
situation that I was in flew across the
country stayed there for a bit realized
it wasn't for me I didn't like not
having a Wi-Fi connection and my client
calls on Zoom not working so I flew back
and I moved into a place and during that
time as well I also quit my job so that
I was able to do that and I knew that
every single freelance client that I had
that allowed me to quit the job could
disappear at any time I knew like that
wasn't a huge possibility but at the
same time it could happen that was
sitting in the back of my mind in 2020 I
signed a lease that was two times more
anything that I've ever were paid before
and anything that I thought that I could
afford so this forced me into the
mindset that I had to make my business
work from 2021 to present I moved
locations about every six months and I
didn't really do this consciously it's
not like I plan to move every six months
it just happened naturally but every
time I did it I moved into a place that
was just a bit above my comfort zone in
terms of what I could afford and I was
okay with this because I knew that the
only limits in the digital world in
terms of business were the ones that I
believed and another thing with moving
is that I found that it was just a great
way to push myself into the unknown
because when you move to a new place I
figured out that around every six months
is when things start to really become
normal to you you fall into a routine
you know the friend group that you have
there you know the places you can eat
the places you can walk the things you
can discover the pla the things that are
in your vicinity you've pretty much
explored everything fizzy physical to
you and so we can talk about diving into
the unknown in like the mental realm and
how that can be explored infinitely with
the internet but it's just a good thing
to note and understand that you can get
into a comfortable spot with the place
that you're living and it can really
impact how far you progress in life
simply because you just become
comfortable without knowing it and
people think this is a good thing
because it makes them not have that much
stress when it comes to just their
everyday life which is a good thing but
you're not pushing yourself into the
unknown in every domain that you can
whether it be physical or mental or
financial and so with moving this Force
like pushing into the unknown and
knowing that I couldn't afford certain
things force me to make my business go
from 50 000 a month to a hundred
thousand a month to 200 000 a month plus
and having surges here and there of
upwards of seven hundred thousand
dollars a month and it would be hard for
me to credit any of this to any single
business video or book or podcast or
anything or course where people think
that they can just get all of the
information that's not how it works you
need experience you need something that
pushes you forward you need to figure
things out for yourself and make it work
with the knowledge that you gain you
can't just acquire knowledge and then
not do anything with it or sit and do
nothing with the knowledge because
you're comfortable in the place that
you're at so this is also when I moved
to Austin Texas with people like JK
Molina and Dakota Robertson and my
editor Devin and again we were there for
six months and I we kind of figured out
the location we got what we needed out
of it and we made a ton of progress in
business especially being around those
right people and so after this I moved
back to Scottsdale Arizona and we broke
our lease in Texas just because we
wanted to get out we wanted to
experience something new and I hadn't
lived in Scottsdale before because I
always perceive that as like too high
above me it's a pretty nice place to
live and so funny thing I'm in this
transitional period now I'm in a
temporary spot I was in Phoenix before
and now I'm going to be moving in a week
to a spot where I sign like a nine month
lease but honestly I'll probably break
it in six so we'll see where that goes
and that's the thing that I've noticed
is this is where I thrive this is where
I make the most progress it forces me to
publish anything that I've been putting
off or act on the ideas that I've had in
my mind if I'm moving somewhere and I
know that I need the resources or I know
that my bank account is going to fall a
bit lower than the standard that I have
for myself then my survival is going to
be threatened I'm going to be put in
this state of stress and I'm going to
have to work to survive and if people
don't have a way of creating the
resources in order to let them do those
things like having a business like I
keep talking about then it's going to be
very hard to progress to a certain point
or do what you want to do with your time
or achieve that autonomy or Freedom that
everyone wants and this is also the time
where I'm just super productive
feel like the flow of information and
the idea generation and just my output
on the things that I do they're so
focused because I have that singular
goal in the back of my mind of wherever
I'm moving or whatever I'm doing there's
different strategies to this but life
becomes so much more meaningful because
it's easy to filter the signal from
noise in the day-to-day situations that
you go through simply because you're so
dead focused on accomplishing a goal
that you're forcing yourself to hit by
throwing yourself into the unknown doing
something that you can't back out of
like signing a lease or doing something
related to that and forcing yourself to
reach that new level if life feels
meaningless it's because you aren't
training your responsibility muscle you
haven't lifted the emotional weight to
add more to the bar and see progress on
a deeper level than muscle so this is
all to say that we're here to talk about
my concept I call tactical stress
because I've noticed this pattern that
we're talking about multiple times in my
life and how beneficial it has been to
me I would argue that it is the secret
to abnormal results and it is a very
extreme and potentially dangerous
strategy a way to preface this concept
is by explaining how a goldfish only
grows as large as the tank that it is
put in so if you put it in a small tank
it will only grow to a certain amount if
you put it into a large tank it will
grow to fit that and this also brings in
the concept of Parkinson's law which
states that work expands so as to fill
the time available for its completion so
if you give yourself 10 minutes to do a
task it's going to take 10 minutes if
you give yourself a week to do a task
it's going to take a week but that
stresses the importance of deadlines and
how to set a true deadline that actually
forces you into action which we'll talk
about later what I call tactical stress
is quite similar to both of these
tactical stress is the conscious
decision to force yourself into a Do or
Die situation knowing that you have the
skill to make it work and have no choice
but to overcome your fears the result is
a season of intensity that propels you
into the next level of your life when
you have an understanding of this
concept you can use it to get out of a
rut right because when you identify as
being in a rut or you're like wow things
are getting very stagnant in my life and
you become aware of that now you will
have a tool to get yourself out of it
because normally you wouldn't have a
tool and you're like [ __ ] I'm stuck in
this rut I have no way out and then
eventually like life happens and you
eventually get out but this is a way to
force your way out let's dig into the
philosophy and psychology of tactical
stress before we get into the actual
strategies that way you have that big
picture understanding you know why it
works because this is a huge problem
with just general how-to advice is
people don't have the depth they don't
have the true understanding of why it
works and so they miss certain things
when they actually go to act or they
don't have the mindset or the
perspective available to them to note
patterns when they are acting to realize
oh this was a mistake now I need to make
a better decision right the purpose of
tactical stress is to launch yourself
into the unknown or the land of infinite
potential and when you do this if you
launch too far you become overwhelmed
with information it becomes difficult to
metabolize that information which we
talked about in the last video on mental
Aesthetics or mental bodybuilding where
going about life and perceiving
information which is what we're doing at
any given moment if you push too far
into something that you don't know too
far into your like out of your comfort
zone then you're exposed to all this
chaotic information that you don't yet
know how to order in your mind or
actually make use of or it's just too
much and you can't filter it so like
your body not being able to just food
when you eat so much and you feel like
[ __ ] it's the same thing with your mind
and so when you do this consciously and
you know that you can acquire the skill
and education necessary to make this
goal work that's where the magic really
happens of course you don't want to
throw yourself too far into the unknown
with the example we used earlier of
course I'm not going to be able to buy
like a billion dollar house and expect
myself to reach that point in business
it has to be just above your level if
you're a level two then you need to aim
for level four not level 100 and when
you do this you're forced to create
Clarity from chaos it's gonna feel a bit
chaotic at first you're going to feel
that stress that tactical stress so you
set a goal that is borderline impossible
force yourself to achieve it and
transmute the stress to study and act
your ass off until it becomes reality
doing this does a few things pertaining
to psychology first it creates a frame
of reference your goal has to stay top
of mind the entire time that you're
doing this when you launch yourself into
the unknown it has to be out of the
pursuit of a goal that is in the unknown
your goal or any goal in life because at
any given moment we are acting towards a
goal whether you're conscious of it or
not most people are acting towards the
unconscious goals that Society assigns
to them like going to school getting a
job retiring at 65 or really anything
just marrying someone that they don't
enjoy or like simply because they're
supposed to marry someone or like the
stereotypical like oh you become a
doctor but I don't want to become a
doctor but you stay in that job simply
because it's expected of you that's what
I mean by you're always pursuing a goal
even right now I'm clearly pursuing a
goal of making a YouTube video but
unless you're doing absolutely nothing
you're pursuing a goal so the point of
this is to set a goal that way you have
that frame of reference that way you can
filter signal from noise you can filter
the important information if I set a
conscious goal to make a hundred
thousand dollars in business and I act
on this tactical stress strategy of
moving into a new place buying something
that I can't afford or another strategy
that we talk about later once I do that
and once I'm forced into that mindset
then everything I see is going to be
through the lens of how is this going to
serve my goal when I'm scrolling on
social media for entertainment the goal
of entertainment then I'm going to
ignore any valuable information that
could benefit my future but if I'm
building a business then I'm going to
filter through the memes and [ __ ]
and get to the value that I see I'm
going to like that and eventually you're
going to condition yourself into that
state of being an education where I'm
going to see an account that's giving
something valuable like this video for
example I'm going to go I'm going to
watch more of their videos their
algorithm is going to start to feed me
more videos and then eventually
character begets action it's going to
shape who you are over time the
information that's circulating in your
head and is top of mind and it will
influence your actions that's the first
thing is that it creates a frame of
reference the second second is that it
creates a deadline a true deadline and
everyone knows that deadlines are useful
in productivity but but most deadlines
aren't real when you fly across the
country or invest your life savings in
coaching the deadline is as real as it
gets you only have so much time to make
it work if you fly across the country to
become a digital Nomad then how much
time do you have until your bank account
hits zero and you become homeless in a
country where you don't even know the
language you either make it work or you
let it fall apart and that's the
prerequisite here is if you don't have a
track record of being ambitious and
taking action on certain things this
strategy isn't for you dude do not
please do not do this because I know
it's going to come back and it's like oh
Dan told me to fly across the country
and waste my entire life savings and now
I'm homeless so don't do that but the
third thing is that it Narrows your
focus because when your mind is narrowed
on a goal this is very similar to the
frame of reference where your mind is
narrowed on a goal let's say like when
you're actually working on something
you're focused on writing let's say
you're writing a newsletter and you know
exactly what to do you have the clarity
to act you have the education to
understanding the prior resources and a
plan to actually make it work and
especially with a deadline like me
posting a newsletter every Saturday I
need to get that done and when your mind
Narrows in distractions can't really
block it because you're so focused on it
so this is another way to end just being
a slave to distractions now one thing
that we do have to talk about before we
go further is removing your money limits
it's it's safe to say that at a certain
point you will have to start a business
or become an entrepreneur to get to
where you want to be in life unless you
settle for something less which of
course there's nothing wrong with if
you're actually happy with that but
that's not the audience that I'm talking
to here like I know my audience and I
know that you guys want more the only
reason I was able to do this time and
time again to increase not only my call
quality of life but my income so rapidly
over four years is that I had a business
that I had control over in order to make
more money in four years at let's say a
corporate job maybe you can get like a
five to ten percent boost in salary if
that I bet that's extremely rare so
let's say you make a hundred thousand
dollar salary in four years ten percent
110 000 salary really with all of that
work if you actually Focus that work
towards a business I don't see why in
four years you couldn't go from a
hundred thousand a year to a hundred
thousand a month if not more in business
all that it takes is a proper strategy
the right skill set a compelling offer
and enough traffic to sell one hundred
thousand dollars worth of a product and
yes I'm aware that's an
oversimplification but that doesn't mean
it's wrong or not worth listening to
finally let's talk about the strategies
for tactical stress now this is where
things get touchy so I I would encourage
you to keep an open mind throughout this
but I'll also these are not the only
things you can do to implement this
strategy there's quite a few things and
I encourage you just to discover your
own but these are just the ones that
have worked for me so number one is
launching a product before actually
building it right because this is a huge
problem I see with creators Freelancers
really anyone that's trying to launch a
product or service is that they just
take forever to build the product and
then they never end up launching it and
they never end up making money so
instead of actually building the product
build the landing page build how you're
going to sell it and accept pre-orders
for it not even pre-orders but just set
a launch date let's say I want to set a
launch date of January 1st I start
promoting three weeks out every week up
until then and once I make the first
sale once I actually make the first sale
then the pressure's on I have to deliver
I have to build the product before
January 1st and that's an MVP that I can
continue to iterate on you're not going
to create the perfect product first time
around that's what a minimum viable
product means is something that you get
out and you test and you iterate with
customer feedback so this will obviously
require you to have marketing and sales
skills so you can actually sell
something but aside from that I would
just recommend watching my one person
business playlist here on YouTube or
enroll in digital economics if you just
want all of my systems and everything
given to you for actually building
launching promoting a product and even
before that building a brand writing
content literally everything the second
strategy is location hopping which we've
talked about so to recap I would pretty
much move locations every six months or
so if not less if not more and once I
felt like I just became way too
acclimated to the location I became too
comfortable I wasn't making much
progress my income stagnated my business
stagnated my ideas stagnated it was
because I wasn't in the both physical
and mental they play into each other a
lot the physical and mental environment
that would be conducive to those things
I knew all of the restaurants I knew
most of the the people that I'd run to
run into every day I knew whether or not
it was going to benefit my future to
actually make friends with certain
people and I go on a lot of walks so
it's not really new anymore that's a
great way to generate ideas is just walk
down A New Path throw yourself into the
unknown take a different route to work
there was no further room for discovery
for me this concept also holds true for
building a business versus working a job
is with a job I think it's good practice
to like job hop every six months to a
year to increase your salary if you can
but you can also get stuck in a job and
just get trapped in this robotic
anti-human state of living both a
business you can do that too but you
have full control you can throw yourself
out there by launching a product and
force your business to grow you have
full control over how far into the
unknown you push the third strategy is
investing in education I used to be a
course hoarder like really I I would
purchase I think I purchased like 50
software development courses when I was
learning programming and I would just
hoard them and I'd watch them and I'd
build projects along with them but I
didn't really learn anything and that's
the thing they helped me build my
knowledge and education to an extent but
they never really led to any tangible
results especially in terms of income
which is the main reason we're all
really learning things and after seeing
some success with freelance web design I
knew I wanted to go all in on social
media I'll be talking about this in one
of the next two videos about just like
how to actually grow on social media the
things that people don't tell you about
it because I saw the potential to
infinitely grow my readership over time
if I could get one follower then I could
get a million and if I could get a
million then I could get 10 million and
so if I had 10 million or 1 million
followers I was kind of set for life if
I had a product that sold I saw that
building an audience with valuable
writing that they wanted to read would
allow me to build and sell anything I
wanted to make a living as long as the
customer wanted it as well this is the
driving force behind why I created to
our writer is because I saw the power of
of writing and building an infinite
readership that would allow me to sell
anything according to my interest that
seems like a logical option for people
that want more out of life and want to
monetize what they enjoy learning about
and improving their self with and
improving others with that's how you
make money so during this time when I
made that decision of I want to go all
in on social media what did I do I
invested 3 500 in a coaching program so
there's always two camps here there's
one camp that is like wow these people
are charging five to ten thousand
dollars for coaching that's insane like
I would never pay for that it's because
one you probably don't have the money
two you haven't experienced good
education before three you don't see the
potential you don't believe you don't
have the mindset you don't have the
awareness and of opportunity that's
available in the online business space
and then there's a second Camp which
they enjoy learning they see the
potential they believe they know that
they can be a part of it and so they
invest and they the the purpose of that
investment for me I didn't even I only
showed up to one coaching call and I'm
not mad about it I'm very grateful that
I did that I showed up to one coaching
call and the only thing that kicked me
into action was wasting that money 3 500
bucks down the drain I went to the
coaching call I realized oh I already
know all of this stuff why am I not
doing anything about it and I started
doing it but if I didn't spend that
money I wouldn't have done it I wouldn't
have made that realization strategy 4 is
material items so this is a touchy one
because it's just common like the most
common thing like money doesn't buy
happiness uh you don't need a fancy car
a fancy watch a fancy house all of this
stuff and I mean that's a half truth I
agree to an extent but there is utility
behind those things as long as they
aren't like shallow surface level
Pursuits where honestly a lot of the
good things in my life came from being
what other peoples would perceive as
materialistic and they taught me about
the thing that I purchased where I
purchased a forty thousand dollar watch
one time and I went home got home put it
on and just hated what I saw I did not
like it I returned it the next day thank
goodness that they had a return policy
but aside from that it taught me like oh
I'm never gonna buy a fancy watch again
unless it really means something to me
or I know the history behind it or it's
something that I truly enjoy or it's a
hobby like watch collecting and like I
have someone much money that I don't
have to worry about it like you need to
think holistically about an individual
situation they're in before you judge
them on oh like they just bought that
that car because they're coping or they
just bought that watch because they're
trying to impress people and on that
point there is utility in that where I
drive a fairly nice car that's the one
thing that I allow myself to like
splurge on is my car and if you're
wondering it's a Mercedes gt63 S it's
pretty fast it sounds good it's matte
black so it's on brand but it is a
status game and I'm aware of that and I
feel like if people are aware that
they're playing status games then it
helps you not become a slave to those
things but you'd be surprised in how
many opportunities just the car alone or
the way I dress right maybe not right
now with like a Vance thing but
when you dress nicely or you go to nice
locations or you live in a nice location
you have access to these this network
and opportunities that are just given to
you if you look good let's say you look
like a homeless guy because you don't
care in your hyper-spiritual hippie but
you're struggling to make money and
survive and deep down you actually hate
your life nobody's going to come up and
talk to you or want to talk to you if
you dress nicely and you're presentable
and you show that you invest in how
people perceive you then people are
going to come up and talk to you and if
a billionaire comes up and talks to you
and gives you a million dollar
opportunity that's available to you now
now that's more of a luck game but it is
a game and it affects your mindset it's
abundance being able to spend this money
knowing that you have the resources and
knowledge and education to make it back
the thing with that is is just don't let
materialism consume you mechanics can
enjoy cars because that's their entire
life right you wouldn't expect like I'm
not going to judge a mechanic for buying
the most fancy Ferrari in the world
because that's what they love that's
what they've spent so much time
developing their mind and expertise
around that's what makes life meaningful
to them now strategy number five is
another touchy one but it's degeneracy
now a lot of the huberman cult and
straight edge people don't really like
talking about alcohol or they think that
nobody should ever drink alcohol in
their life or do any form of
recreational drug and I don't think that
in the slightest obviously there's
addiction obviously there's many things
and excuses that people could come up
with I would encourage you to set your
narrow identity and ideology about
alcohol aside for now and realize that
some people can just have a drink with
dinner or go out and get screwed up
occasionally this happened in my past
but like I would drink a decent amount
like in college obviously and a bit
after college I don't really drink like
a ton right now but I'd say like one two
drinks a week at dinner with friends and
I don't know it always makes me think to
like how some people in foreign
countries like Italy or whatever like
they smoke and they drink excessively
and they live longer than the biohackers
and people that are overly stressed
about their health simply because the
ones that are stressing about their
health the stress is more unhealthy than
smoking a cigarette all the time and so
they die earlier and that's one thing
that always sticks out to me is like if
you're so neurotic about just having a
drop of alcohol like you're that's
probably more unhealthy than the guy
that's having a drop of alcohol so my
point with degeneracy being a strategy
for tactical stress is if you feel all
pent up and you feel like you aren't
making progress but you're working
towards a goal then maybe you need to go
out maybe you need to have some fun
maybe you need to let loose maybe you
need to let loose a little bit too much
because the next day when you wake up
and you feel like [ __ ] and you really
see what it's like to not be able to
make progress towards your goals you
feel the struggle that it takes you
don't have ideas you don't have anything
you're just sitting there stuck and
you're like why did I do that and then
the next day or two days after when
you're feeling better that surge of
energy allows you to attack at full
force and that brings us to our last
point of just emotional transmutation or
allowing yourself to be angry allowing
yourself to have those negative emotions
and feel into them and bounce back out
the other side to use stress in a good
way you stress EU stress that's a thing
a good stress where you are channeling
it into a better future and another
thing you have to understand here is
that regret is a necessary part of life
you can't avoid it and those that try to
avoid regrets end up regretting their
decisions more because they're like I
wasn't supposed to do that when the
person that knows regrets are a part of
life I regret that I'm gonna change
because most people dwell on their
regrets as if they can change them when
they can't they can only change the
choices that they make right now so you
have two options view them as ugly
stains that make life worse or view them
as cracks that can be sealed with better
future decisions there is one pattern
that I've noticed and everyone that is
trying to improve their life the pain of
where you are must outweigh the pain of
what other people think people will
think you are stupid for making stupid
decisions people will talk about you
when you are making big changes most of
the time they just want to entertain
themselves they don't want the
information behind your decisions and
you will learn to ignore them with time
what's the other option let your dreams
die on the Shelf because people say
something you don't like that's a great
way to end up like everyone else I hope
