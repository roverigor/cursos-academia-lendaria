when i read a new book i know i want to
continue reading it based on one thing
i can
feel the areas of my brain
lighting up dopamine the words on the
page seem to
dig into my soul and my curiosity just
pulls me deeper and deeper into the
pages rampant thoughts
flood my mind and they keep me up past
my bedtime which is around like 9 p.m
nowadays but
it's hard to stick to that i have to
keep going down the rabbit hole i have
to keep learning i have to
understand and dissect every single
perspective there is on that specific
thing that is causing my brain to light
up so it lights up more if a book
doesn't do that for me
why why would i read it why would i
force myself to sit there and read
something that i'm not interested in i
feel like this is one big problem with
schools is that people are forced to
learn things that they aren't interested
in and then they never go on to learn or
pursue their curiosity again because
that's why we have the reward mechanism
in our brains
right
to help us separate signal from noise
that's what dopamine does the
unfortunate thing is that modern society
has set us up to drown in this dopamine
and
make it difficult to separate that
signal from noise not everything is
signal not every piece of entertainment
that crosses your screen is supposed to
cause that spike in dopamine and even
then we aren't built
for that
level of exposure and that level and
quantity of stimuli that's passing our
eyes every single day now the real
question behind all of this is what is
the utility
why should i pursue my interest can i do
that
for full time if i'm not able to
actually
maintain this or have some kind of
utility behind reading or just pursuing
your genuine curiosity if there's no
reason to do it if it doesn't pull in
the money or
just fulfill some kind of need in your
daily life aside from just entertainment
which is also a good thing to do but if
there's no real world utility there's
nothing kind of holding you accountable
to
pursuing those curiosities and keeping
that reward mechanism in your head in
check and this has been one big thing
that's on my mind recently is
whether or not intellectual development
or the pursuit of knowledge is actually
worth it right
why would it be worth it if my
job or my relationships or other things
don't require me to actually do that if
there's no purpose behind
my
curiosity pursuits then why would i
continue doing that so that's what we're
going to explore in this video so from
the beginning of time or at least when
time began for you so when you were born
you've been copying other people you are
a copycat by design right how else would
you survive you when you were young your
parents taught you how to eat walk
use the bathroom we talked about this in
the last video but it's worth repeating
and i repeat myself quite a bit why
because why do you like music it's the
repetition that creates the feeling for
you there are only so many
foundational principles that
exist in my work in the work of many
others it's worth repeating
the important things and internalizing
those so internalize this understand
the concept of imitation
copying
cultural conditioning having others
opinions projected on you
you
unconsciously or subconsciously picking
up
certain information from the stimuli
that you are exposed to and it forming
your identity your beliefs and other
things that can cause a lot of pain if
you attach to them if they are something
you need this is
also pertaining to survival and how we
have developed as human beings is that
humans are really the only being that
have a similar reaction
to when their beliefs are challenged
that they're attached to
as a similar reaction would happen
uh in our past lives when our survival
was threatened right someone who is
very set on let's say a religious belief
that has that challenged
they will do anything to
either confirm or just defend that
belief like their life depends on it
they go into
fight or flight and their their focus
narrows their perspective narrows on
that one specific thing and they get
attached to it and nothing else matters
at the moment it's just a belief it's
just a thought in your head and
that's what you're narrowing in on and
as you can see that can cause a lot of
pain and suffering and bring
past traumatic experiences to
the your sensory experience right now so
to add on to this the mind craves order
it hates chaos it hates entropy right
the mind tends towards disorder if we do
not maintain order in our minds or
understand how to navigate uh the chaos
so there is some kind of clarity and
order there then all things kind of go
to then you you start to
go back to an unconscious state and let
things affect you that shouldn't be
affecting you and you see this
everywhere we're going to talk about
this very soon because it is a video
that i have not created yet but a
hierarchy of goals and
how everything revolves around that
every single thing you do revolves
around a hierarchy of goals whether you
are unconscious or conscious of it right
culture has a hierarchy of goals if
it tells you you need to get a job
that's a goal how do you do that you go
to school you learn those are all goals
right whether you want to label them as
goals or not or just check points
objectives quests
whatever games mimic
or have a hierarchy of goals you have
here's how you win the game here are the
quests or checkpoints or what you need
to do in order to get there and it makes
sense that's why we play these games
whether it be a cultural game or a
corporate culture game where oh you need
to show up at this time you need to get
this amount of work done every single
day x y and z extrinsic hierarchy of
goals that you may not want to do and
may not provide that fulfillment as
opposed to you creating your own reality
by creating a intrinsic hierarchy of
goals from the things that you're
curious about and how they will lead to
a better life for yourself and this also
brings up the topic of sense making or
clarity because the mind craves clarity
and we find clarity in these hierarchy
of goals in these games which are
structured hierarchy of goals and in
stories or other things that make sense
to us as human beings we have to label
something in order to understand it a
hand wouldn't be a hand
if a forearm wasn't there to support it
this word that i'm saying right now
would not make sense if i didn't have
the words before it or
the next word i'm about to say would not
make sense if i did not say this word
right this happens in all directions
across all planes of reality that we
latch on to and that's the exact thing
is that we have to
or we feel
the need to
understand the story that we are being
told at any given time who am i why am i
me because i understand i have clarity
on what happened in the psychological
past my memories that came up to form
who i am today and i may or may not have
a hierarchy of goals or a later part of
the story that is coming
that will form who i am in the future or
at least where my current identity will
lead to overcome the anxieties and
depressions of contemporary life
individuals must become independent of
the social environment to the degree
that they no longer respond exclusively
in terms of its rewards and punishments
to achieve such autonomy a person has to
learn to provide rewards to herself
she has to develop the ability to find
enjoyment and purpose regardless of
external circumstances that is a quote
from mihai chiksetmihai from his book
flow i highly recommend you check that
book out and this again is
something i harp on in every single
video the importance of creating a
vision for your future and a hierarchy
of goals to get there because it brings
clarity to your daily actions and bonus
points if you take into account the
intrinsic drivers steven kotler's five
intrinsic drivers are curiosity passion
purpose autonomy and mastery now this is
important extremely important so your
actions lead to a positive potential
reality because if you don't have this
in place as we talked about earlier with
entropy mental disorder not like having
a mental disorder but disorder of the
mind
is going to bring a lot of anxiety and
overthinking and uncertainty to your
daily actions and you're either going to
procrastinate or you just aren't going
to feel or reap the benefits of making
progress on a daily basis and so
shameless plug as always it's free but
my power planner you can get it in the
link in the description it helps you uh
write out this these visions goals
priority tasks etc etc the mark of a
person who is in control of
consciousness has the ability to focus
attention at will to be oblivious to
distractions to concentrate for as long
as it takes to achieve a goal and not
longer and the person who can do this
usually enjoys the normal course of
everyday life that is another quote
another banger quote from mihai which
except mihai enjoyment
is the main benefit of this vision goals
making sense of the world and having
clarity on your life direction success
is a game of intelligent imitation we
understand that imitation can be bad if
unconscious and creating things that we
attach to that cause suffering so we
need to do it intelligently or
in another way
consciously because
imitation or conditioning or programming
or anything else it can't be escaped
our mind processes information whether
we want it to or not whether we are
conscious of it or not so to make the
most of this survival mechanism this
imitation and conditioning we
have to take a step back and think
we have to think about the things that
are we are being exposed to whether it
be our environment is our environment or
at least our perception of our
environment conducive to our goals and
future
are the things that we consume on social
media
which direction are they going to lead
us in what echo chamber are we immersing
ourselves in and how is it going to
impact our future and you may think that
some negative opinions and
self-deprecating memes and other things
that you are exposing yourself to for
the sake of entertainment might not be
affecting you but it is and unless you
become conscious of that it's going to
be very hard to escape and you are going
to wonder
why is why is all of this happening to
me when you just aren't conscious of the
information that you are consuming so
this is the question are you allowing
the message of growth and progress and
abundance
to
go in go into your brain and allow that
to be the information that you process
and you
being in control over that or are you
letting the message of
fear and
self-deprecation and all of these
limiting beliefs what are you exposing
yourself to and again this brings up the
importance of pursuing your genuine
curiosity right if you're pursuing the
things that other people want for you in
terms of what you consume
then
you're going you may get stuck in this
trap of
moving in a negative life direction but
if you pursue what you truly want to and
this takes practice to actually notice
the feeling of excitement or the raise
the raised levels of dopamine in your
head you need to become conscious of
that and what causes that and one big
thing that has been on my
recommendation list pertaining to this
is to reread
your favorite book what is the book that
caused so much excitement that made you
read the entire thing uh you love that
author you recommend the book to
everyone reread that book and you can
start to notice
one you'll pick up
a completely different message the
second time around but you will also be
able to notice that and understand like
okay yes i am curious about this this is
intrinsic i can replicate this in other
things that i am consuming now this is
where things get interesting because i
am a fan of doing what you want with
your life and usually that
implies that you will be
pursuing the skills developing the
skills and other things that allow you
to make an income doing what you want
that doesn't have to be via
entrepreneurship but that's what i've
done for the past three to four years
and that's what i teach you can get a
job with these things you can do other
things but i'm going to speak
from the lens
of entrepreneurship the creator economy
and other things like that and you
make make this connection as we go on so
i'm going to throw up a graphic on the
screen and we're going to be referencing
this for the rest of the thing this is
the intelligent imitation process now i
also want you to understand that you
as a human being are a perspective
vessel
okay
everything is perspective
everything internalize this this can
truly impact your life on a deep level
everyone is arguing their own
perspective on something
based on their beliefs their values
their experiences everything that has
formed their perspective as of right now
so when you see someone in the comments
section
and they're like let's say you make a
post and you see someone in the comment
section and they're like oh no this is
wrong this is absolutely wrong
everything's relative to
an individual's perspective they don't
see if i were not to have
uh
primed this part of the video with the
fact that i'm talking from an
entrepreneurial mindset there could be
people in here that have not been
exposed or made aware of
the things that are actually possible
they'd be oh that's not no that's not
possible just go get a real job what are
you doing get a real job and fun fact 60
of future jobs have not even been
created yet like there's marijuana
therapists and uh
twitter ghost writers and other things
that like creators are creating their
own jobs that's a big theory and
philosophy of mine is that their creator
economy is
the future
so you get better at seeing other
people's perspective which is empathy
by
learning how to catch yourself when your
perspective or your focus gets very
narrowed in on one thing you zoom out
and you see the entire picture
one
quote of mine or tweet of mine is to
zoom in on what's important so your
values uh and other things like that and
zoom out from everything else that's
kind of a spin
on a herman hess quote that says uh
determine what is important and laugh at
the rest
it's as simple as that because with
perspective i like to think of it as a
camera right perspective is a camera and
most people have theirs on a tripod just
firmly planted in the ground i'm not
moving this this is all that matters and
then perception is the lens right and
now if i blur the lens you don't see the
full picture you have to assume what is
on the other side of that lens and make
sense of the story by yourself and feed
it to yourself so you think they're
wrong when in essence you're just
arguing the wrong side of the argument
to yourself because you can't move your
perspective so take your tripod out of
the ground and
move it around try to this is a skill
this is such a valuable skill to try and
mold your mind
to fit into the other person's shoes
and at least try to see what they are
seeing and even if you can't
who who cares and another quote
i'm just a quote machine today but
another quote is to
uh is that there is no right or wrong
there is only sense and nonsense
and so sense making we what we think
what you think is right from your
perspective is what you can make sense
of or what makes sense to you everything
else is wrong because you don't have the
awareness you don't have the world view
or experiences that made it make sense
to someone else attention is the new
currency
novelty is what grabs attention novel
perspectives are your unique way of
grabbing attention
right we talked about media and code in
the last one and the necessity of
learning how to capture attention but
this goes far beyond entrepreneurship
this goes for everyday life as well if
you want to be remembered or you want to
stick in people's heads and
be seen as valuable
because you're not just regurgitating
the things that you imitated
previously
you you have to view things from a new
perspective this goes for content this
goes for sales this goes for really
anything that you are putting out into
the world you are consuming based on
your curiosity you are connecting the
dots and then from your perspective
you're putting out a fresh and novel
perspective or just message on it that
makes sense to a group of people that
want to follow you right that's why you
like a specific book but not everyone
likes that specific book that's why that
book is your favorite and other people
may think oh that's yeah it's a good
book but it's not my favorite i don't
see why it's your favorite it's
perspective it's it's everything we've
talked about so far and that is why
saturation in the creator economy does
not exist if you understand this concept
of intelligent imitation how everything
is perspective and you are in the
business of creating a novel perspective
and making it make sense through stories
metaphors concepts example of a concept
intelligent imitation is just something
i made up it's a concept that
helps you understand this better and
again this going beyond
entrepreneurship and people just
following you or buying your products or
your services
this is what's going to get you hired
over the next person is you stick in
their mind you you cause that raisin
dopamine through a novel perspective to
let's say an employer that you
interviewed with and they're going to
stick in your you're going to stick in
their head because you're like wow that
guy actually that guy really made sense
that guy changed my mind
on this issue
and even even then it just lowers like
the necessity of having to actually
build your value because you're sticking
in people's heads and being remembered
by internalizing and practicing this
intelligent imitation concept now i'm
very big and i see i can see
the online landscape shifting quite a
bit when it first started out and maybe
a few years ago it was all funnels and
sales strategies and marketing and
clickbait and people have caught on to
it and it's the same thing with
corporation going back to individual and
what we talked about in the last video
about how communities as opposed to
corporations
are comprised of individuals
pursuing what they want under a
hierarchy of goals of a community like a
like-minded community pursuing what they
want and so with this i believe
things are shifting back and i see this
more often there are people that double
down on trust simplicity and
individuality they're making
a lot more money and making a much
bigger impact than those that are
doubling down on the tactics which is
like uh sales strategies and all these
marketing tactics like uh like urgency
and
countdown timers and all this stuff if
you can double down on trust simplicity
and individuality then you will win so
pretty much a personal brand with a
personal perspective
and time in the game so you build trust
by being
authentic you
display simplicity by making sense to
other people via a novel perspective
and
you
harp on individuality
by taking responsibility for your own
future so if you want to do all of this
and as with most of my videos i end them
with some kind of practical step-by-step
process to actually implementing this
information because now it all makes
sense to you but it's like okay what can
i actually do
to make this a reality reality for
myself what can i practice so step one
is choosing three to five mentors that
you aspire to be like and one thing to
go along with this is that as we've
learned you become what you consume so
consume in accordance with who you want
to become
and
the the thing with all of this is is
these should stick out to you these
should be
your favorite authors or your favorite
social media accounts or
really anything your favorite podcasters
youtubers the the internet right you
have access to people that
have a congruent voice that makes sense
to you so then you can take those and
make sense to others by combining them
and this goes far beyond just their
teachings right i'm a big fan of
emulation imitation whatever it may be
if you like their product why would you
not go and make a similar product for
yourself
right because you already know it sells
you already know all of the information
in there you hopefully have experience
with it before you actually go and sell
it but you're making it your own from
your own perspective in a way that you
understood it and you sell it to the
people that you have a congruent voice
with and again this goes beyond products
this goes what colors what brand colors
do they have how can you use those what
is their tone how do they speak how do
you want to speak how do you want to
write how do you want to design your
posts right it's like if you are just
perceptive if you're receptive of the
things around you
it's it's intuitive all of this online
business stuff is intuitive because
people are already doing it and there
are certain aspects of certain
businesses and certain people that you
like that you can pull from to form your
own unique and original brand content
products all of the above step two is to
stop consuming and start researching
right because consuming to me implies
that you aren't doing anything with
information you aren't
enacting the hermetic law of use right
you aren't using the information so
you're going to lose it by researching
right so let's say something lights up
your brain you re-read the first chapter
of your favorite book and you you take a
note right and this is all a process you
can get in my free guide uh seven days
to genius ideas it's my creative process
for actually doing all this stuff this
is
why this video is being created this is
kind of my process but if you want a
guided way of doing it link in the
description when you adopt the
perspective
of a researcher
everything starts to gain utility
right because you're actively trying to
connect and apply it to some something
there's intention and purpose behind
your consuming you're no longer on
social media to be entertained and
mentally masturbate you're there to
research you're there to take something
dissect it expand upon it summarize it
uh connect the dots to other things
you've learned and then form this new
perspective that you can go and create
and make sense to other people and
condense that information like we talked
about in the last video as well all of
these interconnect and you can see where
i'm going with this where
humans can process 126 bits of
information per second
and you reading something that takes you
60 million bits of information to
process and then you packaging it up
from a new perspective in a more
simplified way but still holding meaning
and value
you're helping other people learn that
same thing much much much faster than
you did because you have condensed that
information into let's say 10 million
bits and you've made it make more sense
so other people are developing
themselves faster because of you you're
improving their quality of life that is
extremely valuable so we've we kind of
just touched on this but step three is
to get in touch with yourself and write
it down you can't be
viewing these perspectives that you're
taking in
from a very narrow perspective where you
aren't you aren't giving yourself room
to
explore the other options and connect
the dots and expand your mind and
gain awareness on the other things
related to that right there's
there's the iceberg of opportunity that
i've talked about before where
what you consume is the tip of the
iceberg but then everything under it is
what you're trying to dissect and you
can get sucked into that iceberg and you
can turn that iceberg into an entire
career and you have to get in touch with
yourself because
that this isn't possible if
you aren't really conscious or you're
close-minded you have to breathe when
you like if your focus is narrowed
creativity is very hard to exist in that
head space if your focus is spatial and
expanded that's when creativity comes
into play because you can pull
from many different sources your your
mind is open to those things and it's
much easier to tap into i'm sure a lot
of you have experienced this it's like
sometimes you sit down or you're angry
or other things and it's like
your your mind is so fixated on a few
things that you can't even remember what
you ate for lunch the other day like it
takes a while but then when you are
stress free and you're open and ready to
receive information and you feel a bit
more creative you're in that spatial
awareness
place and you can pull and you're you
are much smarter when you're not
narrowly focused on something so and by
doing this you open up room for that
dopamine to be more accurate right you
are allowing that signal
to
separate the signal from the noise and
that is what you write down you note the
golden nuggets that cause excitement in
you when you are reading and so step
four is to dissect and distill that
right you aren't writing
their entire book you're taking a piece
out of it and then a piece out of
another book and a piece out of another
book and a piece from social media and
then you're expanding on these with your
personal experiences your
your summary and how it makes tends to
you may be a step-by-step process
relating to the problems that that
specific thing presents and
how to get to a better place and now you
can see this is forming the foundation
of articles posts
and
products for yourself so here's a more
structured way to do it you have the
sentence or just something that caught
your attention and now you want to
develop it you want to dissect it you
want to understand it deeper so here's
what you do you write down the topic
that it relates to a brief summary of
how you understand it
the common problems associated with that
topic the common benefits to overcoming
those problems
objections or limiting beliefs that
people have to solving those problems
personal experiences and stories you
have with that topic and a step-by-step
process for overcoming that problem and
reaping those benefits and so you may be
wondering okay dan well what can i do
with all that information it feels like
i'm just taking notes here well again
that's why i keep stressing the
importance of starting a social media
account or a personal brand because it's
not only for entrepreneurship it's a
modern day resume and that's where
employers are hiring from but you use
that information like if you're a
marketer or you are in the social media
space you see where i'm going with this
because this is all social media is its
problems benefits processes it's all of
this stuff so what you just wrote out it
forms a foundation of a blog post a
twitter thread an instagram carousel a
youtube video a podcast and then that
can be broken down into tweets reels
posts really anything and so that's how
you dissecting all of that information
from one little thing that you read from
say your favorite book is how you form
that unique perspective that novel
perspective that is going to separate
you from a quote-unquote competitor and
so after you do this for a while you
build this database of
just your intellectual property that you
can pull from at any given time because
this doesn't just stop after one thing
you do this time and time again i have
an entire database of all this stuff and
that's how i create these videos as i
come up with a topic and it's like okay
go to my database this one can help with
the intro this one can help with the
body this one can help with the
conclusion this will help make a bit
more sense here and like i've had people
question or ask me like well what's your
creative process behind all of this or
how are you so creative and it's like
it's structured it's not like i just
pull this out of my ass and start
talking and that's what nobody does like
the people that are super skilled at
this
and can do it off the cusp then yeah
that like that's good and that's what
all of us are aiming for and i can
definitely do that more than i was able
to previously but only because i
developed and understood the ideas in a
way that made sense to me so i can make
them make sense to you or at least the
people
that
connect with how i actually distill this
information for you
i hope this is making some like good
connections for you so that is it for
