if you can spend eight hours building
someone else's dreams you can spend one
hour building your own one of the most
powerful ideas I've been thinking about
recently is bringing your ideal future
into the now and what I mean by that is
performing the same actions that you
would in your ideal lifestyle but on a
much smaller scale so let's say I want
to write for two hours every morning for
the rest of my life then what I'm going
to do I already do that right now but
what I did in the past is I am going to
start writing for five minutes a day 15
minutes a day 30 minutes a day one hour
a day and slowly increasing over the
years until I can sustain the two hour a
day writing lifestyle because frankly it
doesn't make sense to wait and put off
what you're already going to be doing
because I'm assuming what you're going
to be doing is going to be directly
attributing to the work you are going to
do or your life's work and so if you're
not already doing those things the then
you it's going to be much more difficult
when you decide to finally start doing
them and already you're already going to
have to start small and taper up so if
you don't have the time right now to
write for 15 minutes every day you're
not going to have the time in the future
if writing is going to be what you're
doing for work and so the way that you
dissect what actions you should be
taking is what we're going to talk about
soon this whole video is dedicated to
deep work and actually executing on the
tasks that you're going to be doing but
slowly tapering up until you can do them
longer and so the reason I want to write
for the rest of my life is just that
right I realized my ideal future and I
realized that I'm going to have to be
writing anyways if I want to continue
writing into the future I also realized
that writing was not the first thing
right you have to try things and start
to execute on fundamental tasks in order
to understand what it is that you want
right because at first my desires were
selfish they still kind of are but I
knew that I had to make money somehow in
order to sustain or or build a future
lifestyle for myself and so with that I
started on social media before that I
did freelancing and other things and
through that trial and error and
realizing okay I don't like client work
I don't really care for web design
anymore I did at the time but I outgrew
it and now I'm getting into this writing
thing and I'm learning all about it and
I love it right and I would have never
stumbled on that unless I had already
been working towards my ideal future so
whether it be you start writing for 15
minutes every single morning or you just
start working on the things that will
bring you closer to your ideal future
that way you can figure out what you
don't want and allow that to act as a
self-corrective compass into figuring
out what you actually do want and then
once you find that that's the best place
to be right then you can just execute xq
execute until you can make it further a
part of your day because it becomes
seamless at that right when I came
across writing and understood that it is
the foundation of all media and it is
how I get my products and services in
front of people and build a name for
myself I also realize that it helps me
clear my mind it helps me harness my
creative ability I started stacking wise
behind this one action so that when I
woke up it was almost automatic that I
just got straight into writing so the
next thing is that when you bring your
actions from your ideal future or the
things that are going to actualize your
ideal future into the now and start
executing on them you begin to invest
mental energy in a goal through focus on
that goal so you are investing energy in
that ideal lifestyle that you are trying
to create and the more you do this
whether it be 15 minutes a day or an
hour and a day or four hours a day
you're investing energy or currency in a
metaphorical sense here and so the more
you do it the more you feel obligated to
do it that's how you build momentum and
that's how you find passion you don't
just find an action that you're a super
passionate about instead you start
investing mental energy into a goal you
do the actions that are required to get
to that goal and then you cultivate
passion along the way because you
discover things that you wouldn't have
discovered without that direct
experience and so when you don't work on
this goal you will feel as if you are
wasting that currency you're wasting
that investment and so then again your
body and your mind are going to tell you
hey I need to get back to doing this
goal I can't get distracted or else I'm
not going to feel the progress the
momentum the passion that I felt before
and that's how you sustain a passionate
fulfilling and momentum full life and so
another thing that comes into play here
is my law of conceptual survival
conceptual survival is the human
phenomenon where our survival instincts
have transcended the Physical Realm and
are included in the mental we work to
survive ideas Concepts and beliefs that
form our sense of self so if you
identify or you create this goal that
starts to form your perspective and how
you view the world and start acting in
alignment with it and investing mental
energy into that goal or your future
identity you start to slowly build that
identity right and buy conceptual
survival we are trying to survive our
concept of self and so our actions are
going to align with that the more that
we do these things the more that you are
consistent with the Deep work that are
we are going to talk about here and so
with this when you view
your daily situations from the lens of
your future self or from the lens of the
goal that you are working towards you
are going to see life in a completely
different light right you're going to be
scrolling on social media and a post
that you normally wouldn't have stopped
and looked at is going to stop your
scroll and it is going to help you in
the actualization of that goal like a
Fitness Post is going to grab your
attention more than some mindless cheap
entertainment post and the same goes
with conversations you're going to
listen from the lens of your goal and be
able to filter what they say from that
so you can spot the things that actually
help you move towards that goal so the
main lesson here to end this little
section of the video is that if you
aren't working towards your ideal future
you're working towards someone else's
because either way we are goal-oriented
creatures and if you do not create your
own goal and start to invest energy in
that identity you're going to invest
energy into the identity that is
assigned to you like being a college
student or having a corporate job title
or being a retired at 65 years old dude
and your actions are going to follow to
survive that belief whether you are
conscious or want to frame it as this
whole conceptual survival thing or not
and so next we're going to talk about
the holistic daily routine fill your
brain in the afternoons with books
learning and socialization empty your
brain before bed with journaling
planning and meditation use your brain
in the morning with creation output and
focus you need dedicated time every
single day for creativity productivity
and experimentation that is what's going
to help you achieve your goals because
you need the mixture it can't only be
productivity without experimentation and
being able to refine along the way or
you're just executing on tasks that have
been laid in front of you and so the
first objection that comes to mind here
is that you don't have enough time Dan I
don't have enough time and that's fine
I'm not asking you to spend four hours a
day on this or six hours a day or eight
hours a day I'm asking you to spend the
minimum amount of time you can because
if you don't then you aren't creating
your future life like if you aren't
dedicating time and actually blocking
out and focusing for that time in order
to move levers towards your ideal future
then you're not going to create it it's
that simple and you don't you shouldn't
feel like you need two three hours at
the very start of your journey like a
young dude who has no responsibilities
if you have a wife and kids then yeah
you're gonna have to start with 15 to 30
minutes and work up from there and it's
going to take a bit longer because
that's the thing a lot of people don't
realize this or notice this is that your
psyche isn't wired for Modern Life right
it's not wired for being under
fluorescent lights going and sitting in
a cubicle right think of it like a
monkey in a cubicle I know you're not a
monkey but a monkey would suffer in a
cubicle because its psyche is not wired
for that we need to hunt and in this age
what I mean by hunting is novel dopamine
sources or meaningful dopamine sources
or import something new in your life
discoveries creativity that's what
hunting is is being able to find
something new take it create something
with it and that feels so good and so
many people don't
have that benefit in their life so if
Modern Life has become normal to you the
repetitive NPC automaton lifestyle do
you know what an automaton is like a
little robotic uh doll thing that's what
most people are if this modern life
becomes normal to you you are by
definition trapped in The Matrix which
is a metaphorical term for you are just
enslaved and a slave to routine and many
of you are familiar with how I
structured my days so I will keep this
brief you need three activities to
pursue your goals full force one that
fills your mind you need education ideas
and novel resources you can apply
towards your goals this will lead to
intrinsic motivation one that empties
your mind you don't want to be trapped
in a chaotic bubble of thoughts and
useful ideas that's exactly how you make
zero progress write things down one that
uses your mind you need a vessel to
focus your efforts with your ideas and
the clarity to execute build your future
so this video is going to be for focused
on that last Point using your mind with
deep work now I've talked about that
entire process before in my previous
video the three-step productivity
framework it's about the fill empty use
framework so check that out if you're
interested who you are what you think
feel and do what you love is the sum of
what you focus on Cal Newport so now
we're going to talk about the need for
deep work Cal Newport is the author of
the book deep work I have it somewhere
out in my living room I've never read it
but I have been doing my own version of
Deep work for the past
10 years really I'd say probably six
years actually productivity is about
getting the most effective work done in
the least amount of time possible
productivity is not about seeing who can
work the longest and then wear that as a
badge of honor that they can show their
friends co-workers and peers that's just
a status game in a world of
notifications ample options and
overwhelm deep work is frankly no longer
an option it is a necessity you have to
block out time to work on your future or
to work on your business or just to
avoid conversation notifications or
distractions as a whole you need to sit
back you need to channel the creative
Firepower that you've gained through
your consumption or your education or
your skill acquisition and you need to
focus that into a vessel AKA a business
to actually to reap the benefits from
that business in the form of money
connections and just resources in
general and then be able to have that as
currency that you can trade up towards a
better life for yourself deep work is
how you build out your dreams in record
time so now we're going to talk about
the priority ladder and with this with
the priority ladder you can drastically
change your life in six months with one
hour a day of focused work one hour
that's it do not think that you need
anything more than one hour one
meaningful project one day at a time so
with the priority ladder it's pretty
it's just that it's a priority ladder
where there's priority one two three and
four and they are all not only
decreasing in challenge but also
increasing in the amount of distraction
potential that there is right so
Priority One is just absolute laser
focused on building out your vision with
through a project and then priority four
is something like maintenance tasks
where you are responding to emails uh
responding to messages and doing other
things like that where you are more open
to actually
potentially being distracted because
there's nothing after that right there's
no creative work that you have to do so
we will start with Priority One now
Priority One this is this pretty much
built my entire life right for as long
as I can remember even into my younger
years I always had one project that I
was working on
pretty close to first thing in the
morning now it's always first thing in
the morning like right now I'm writing
my book because that is a new project
right it is not something that I have to
consistently work on right now like it's
not something that I have to maintain or
update always it's something new and so
that's what the first priority should be
right so if you have not built anything
and you only have one hour a day to
spare this is the one hour time block
that you use this is where you're
focusing your efforts on the levers that
are going to lead to creating your
vision for the future and then once that
is done so for beginners it's probably
going to be something like starting a
social media brand learning how to write
with my two hour writer or digital
economics course and then as you break
through the perception threshold that we
talked about in a previous video where
it's very difficult at the beginning but
slowly becomes more pleasurable with
time where it's going to be difficult
and your mind is going to perceive it as
more difficult than it's going to be and
that person this difficulty is going to
increase and you until you hit that
breakthrough right and then you're able
to systemize things and then it just
flows a lot smoother and then you can
fit so much more into that hour right
your first hour of focused work isn't
going to be that focused you have to
stick it out and refine your system with
time and then once you start seeing
results from that first hour of work
then you move that into the second
priority time block so you can start
working on something new right so then
when we move into priority two that's
where your lever moving tasks go so in
this case for me it's like uh replying
on social media or creating content
mostly creating content because that's
like how I feed my system right and it's
creative work it's something that I do
not want to Outsource and then what
people before when you move that up to
the second priority you're going to
start something new in Priority One
because that is what's going to keep
meaningful dopamine flowing and that is
what's going to maintain momentum along
this path until you you systemize that
and then you bump it up another priority
right so for the the next thing that
most people should do after starting a
social media brand and once they start
seeing results with that and it becomes
a lot more efficient for them to keep up
with that then you're going to start
building a service or a product so that
you can monetize and then once that's
done you move that up and start reaching
out to people but then you can start
building out a funnel or something else
and then all of these things slowly like
build on each other over time the third
time block is also for Lever moving
tasks or creative tasks or meaningful
tasks right so the things that you don't
want to Outsource I will never Outsource
my writing at least I hope I won't maybe
I will
um but in terms of like just writing in
my day I'm not going to Outsource it as
a whole the third time block is just to
continue keeping the momentum going on
whatever you're building and all of this
can also apply to like a corporate job
or just any work that you have you have
to structure your days with this method
and so the fourth time block or the
priority four is four maintenance tasks
and for me that's like checking messages
responding to messages checking emails
responding to emails
um checking the modern Mastery community
and interacting there this is where I
expose myself to people right it sounds
kind of weird to say it that way but if
you expose yourself to messages or your
phone or notifications way too early in
the morning that one Rogue thought that
you get from it that you think isn't of
importance when you first see it like oh
I can touch my phone in the morning and
work just fine no you can't it's gonna
pop up and then that alone is going to
split your focus and then that opens up
room for entropy where your mind starts
going to all of these different thoughts
without you knowing it that's the thing
you probably think it's normal right now
for you to do that and you think that
you're doing the best most efficient
work you are but you're not so you push
back all of the conversational and
maintenance tasks to the fourth priority
and now with all of these I like to
structure these anywhere from 45 to 90
minutes long time blocks for a priority
one two three and four each and then in
between I'll take a break I'll make
breakfast I'll make lunch I'll go on a
30 to 40 minute walk and listen to
something in my ears usually closer to
the last ones but in a nutshell that's
really it there's no reason for me to go
over exactly like all every little hack
that I do because
the the entire Joy of all of this comes
through experimentation creating a way
that you like doing and just testing
different techniques so that's a
technique that I'm giving you that you
can test and then you can pull some of
the good things from it put it into your
own day and slowly refine that over time
until you live a completely self-made
lifestyle if you will so if you enjoyed
this process first I encourage you to
implement it second I encourage you to
like And subscribe and comment
um comment if anything stuck out to you
or what you're going to implement
because I'm curious to hear which parts
stuck out the most there and then third
uh check out the products to our writer
digital economics modern Mastery
community that you can join for five
bucks links in the description along
with some other free uh my power planner
which also helps with productivity and
then some other cool resources down
there so check those out and with that
have a great rest of your day peace
