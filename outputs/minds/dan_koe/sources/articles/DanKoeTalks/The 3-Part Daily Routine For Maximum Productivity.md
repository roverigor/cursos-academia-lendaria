i've always had some form of aversion
toward
western work culture 80 hour work weeks
high pressure environments and little
time for rest and recovery it just never
felt
right it felt like human beings weren't
supposed to be
locked up in a fluorescent lit cubicle
their entire life why would i want to
waste my entire day
knowing that two to three hours in
i would not be as productive creative or
just be able to put
as much out
into the world as i could and i truly
believe that this is starting to form
not only the creator economy but
remote work as a whole the tide is
shifting and it has been for a long time
it takes a long time for a tide to shift
but
the system is finally correcting itself
or it's becoming more apparent at least
to me because i'm immersed in that
environment so four hour work days
singular focus and meaningful work are
becoming the norm in my little pocket of
twitter or instagram or wherever we are
on social media with the rise of people
educating people on modern tools
and other things that allow them to
pursue what they want to pursue and
create
world-shifting
creations in a sense where
people that are improvement-minded are
going on the internet solving their own
problems and teaching people how they
did it so they are
in essence doing what a lot of the
ancient masters and modern spiritual
teachers
have been
kind of crying about not crying but like
shouting about for the longest time
which is raising the collective human
consciousness or just raising general
awareness that you are in control of
your life and you can create an
enjoyable lifestyle for yourself the
clever man may work smarter not harder
they say but the creative man doesn't
work at all now that is a quote from
alex kim pong i'm rereading the book
rest by him and it is very enlightening
i would recommend that you pick it up so
if you're anything like me and you like
going to the gym then you understand the
need
the need for rest and recovery you
understand that you don't go into the
gym for eight hours at a time absolutely
destroy your body at full output and
expect to recover or even enjoy the rest
of your day it doesn't work that way and
focus is a muscle it really is props to
joey justice for
uh i guess coining that phrase focus is
a muscle because it is it should be
treated like a muscle because you can
only put
out so much psychic energy or mental
energy at a time you need to recoup you
need to recover the psychic energy
through rest now i have been developing
my own productivity and creativity
system for a long time now i have tried
all of the routines i've tried pomodoro
i've tried all the productivity apps i
mean i have a ton of trainings with joey
in modern mastery about productivity and
how to get into flow i've studied flow
i've studied spirituality i've studied
zen and there are a lot of patterns and
crossovers that have gone into creating
this three-part framework that i call or
it's just a three-part framework that is
fill empty use now this framework is for
anyone that has more autonomy in their
lives whether that be creatives create
tours knowledge workers consciousness
workers really anything that
allows you the time and freedom to not
spend eight hours in a cubicle but that
does not eliminate the
what this
framework can do for your life because
what i want to do here is go in depth on
a tweet that i had go viral a few months
ago and that tweet was fill your brain
in the afternoons with books learning
and socialization
empty your brain before bed with
journaling planning and meditation use
your brain in the morning with creation
output and focus
so with this i want you to understand
that this is not
uh limited or confined to a specific
time in the day fill empty use are more
so like check boxes that you should be
checking
throughout your day so the first thing
is fill fill your mind fill your brain
now why are you filling your brain one
to learn and just be exposed to your
interest more than
just being distracted see this is more
so rather than this being a productivity
framework this is more of an intentional
living framework that in essence leads
to productivity so if you want to create
better content or you want to speak
better or you just want to have be
interesting and have things to talk
about then you need to
intentionally consume information
aligned with your interests this is
this isn't optional this really is not
optional right because one we're all on
social media two
every single book that talks about
success talks about following your
curiosity and learning new skills it
just has to be a thing for you it has to
be a thing and so the way that i do this
is i go on a walk
a lot i walk a lot i walk like 30k steps
a day but uh in the afternoon i have one
walk that is dedicated it is it is like
a creativity time block where i am
walking and listening to an audiobook
very intentionally i am it's kind of
like a walking meditation where i'm
listening as closely as i can
to understand what the person is saying
and then when a golden nugget pops pops
into my head or i hear something that
causes that dopamine level to raise and
causes excitement that's how you notice
it is excitement and you're like oh man
i have to write this down and so you
take out your phone you write it down
if you need a way to structure this uh
download my free challenge to 10x your
creative output it's called seven days
to genius ideas but
that is what you have to do you have to
fill your brain with information that is
conducive to your goals if you
understand my three pillars which is
focus energy and experience you need
energy to put towards your goals you
need to align almost everything you
consume
physically mentally whatever it may be
in alignment with your vision for the
future and your goals and i guarantee
that it will be near impossible not to
hit those goals if your entire life is
intentional and
conducive to hitting those goals now
i'm a big fan of
like getting the most bang for my buck
out of what i'm doing in the day so when
i go on walks they're not i'm not just
walking mindlessly sometimes i flaneur
and i just go around and walk and
enjoy and enjoy and have wonder for life
itself but my walks have a lot of
purpose behind them one being consuming
intentionally because i'm a content
creator right i need that information
and it's conducive to me to my goals of
growing an audience
making an income for myself and all of
the above right but another thing you
can do to consume information is read in
the sun right so this is similar to a
walk if you go shirtless or something
but sunlight is is extremely important
for your health it is
one of the utmost important things for
your health
i would argue more so than nutrition
nutrition of course it's important and
there's things with that but sunlight is
extremely important as i've been
learning so one thing you can do
is use
this as an excuse to get out into the
sun right because if you're at home and
you're trying to consume information or
really do anything you're just
surrounded by distractions that's like
that's why i like walks so much is
because it it's impossible almost
impossible to be distracted out there
and the same goes for laying out in the
sun if you go outside and you go
somewhere to read or to listen or to
just
like intentionally scroll the timeline
and get what you need and get off then
it becomes that much more enjoyable
because if you understand flow
psychology then you can see where i'm
going with this you have a goal for the
activity that you're doing you have
intention behind it and you know exactly
what you need to do you understand the
rules of the game that you are choosing
to play at this given moment in your
life so that was fill your mind number
two is empty your mind now why are we
filling our mind before we
talk about using our mind or emptying
our mind it's because we need that
information but at that point uh we have
so much in our head that we're thinking
about that one we need to empty our mind
and there's many ways to do that which
we will talk about but before we even
use our mind while working
we need to come from a place of
creativity and calm you can't do it when
you're focused on if you need to focus
on
um
let's say writing an article but you're
still thinking about uh this other thing
that you heard from an audiobook that's
completely unrelated then it's it's
gonna split your focus and it's going to
be hard to channel that psychic or
mental energy into your work so the
second thing is empty your mind so in
psychology there is
a network in your brain called the
default mode network so this is from the
book rest
the dmn or the default mode network is a
series of interconnected sections that
activate as soon as people stop
concentrating on external tasks and
shift from outward focused to inward
focused cognition so when i say empty
your mind i'm more so saying let the
default mode network or your
subconscious mind take over right so
this happens when you're on a walk when
you're contemplating when you're
meditating when you're at the gym and
you're under intense pressure and your
default mode network is still working
and
what's very interesting about this
default mode network in your brain is
that it is
almost if not as active
as your brain is right now as you're
when you're focused on a task it is
still active that's extremely
interesting because that
is the process that's when you have like
insight right or you make that discovery
or you remember something it's your
subconscious mind working on tasks that
bring
whatever insight or idea it may be to
your conscious mind so this is what
creativity is all about really and
having all of those
brilliant ideas if you could say that
and so one example that comes to mind is
a programmer so i used to be a
programmer i know a lot of people
face this problem but this is a good way
to explain it right
so when a programmer
is working
and coding they usually encounter a bug
and what that is is just something that
uh
makes the code not work the code isn't
working and so they're like okay why
isn't this working i need to find the
bug
that
is is causing this to screw up and so
they work they try super hard at trying
to figure out what it is they waste days
trying to figure out what the actual
problem is and then they're like okay i
give up
so after a period of struggle they give
up and then as they're going about their
day as their default mode network has
taken over it gives them the problem
it's like shower thought when the
perfect idea comes to your mind the
problem or the solution to the problem
is brought to their conscious mind and
they're like oh my god that was the
easiest fix in the world for the bug and
then they go to the computer they try it
out and boom it works so this is how you
have those genius or brilliant ideas is
by
not trying to solve the problem it's by
going about your day and i know quentin
tarantino does this i know uh others do
it and this is really about filling your
days with the things that you enjoy
whether that be walks whether that be
reading whether that be meditating
contemplating going to the gym this is
about deep play and deep rest and
figuring out what you like to do that
isn't
uh deep work and with empty your mind
you can't
ignore the famous bruce lee quote which
is empty your mind be formless shapeless
like water if you put water into a cup
it becomes the cup you put water into a
bottle and it becomes the bottle you put
it into a teapot and it becomes the
teapot now
water can flow or it can crash be water
my friend that is somewhat related but
at the same time i think it brings
a good conclusion to
emptying your mind but i want to give
you a few other things that you can do
to empty your mind so one the gym get in
the gym go to the gym but you
can also nature bathe so what that means
go on a hike go out in the woods just
just get your mind off of the task for
the day pay attention to nature and all
of that fun stuff another way is through
physical mediums so journaling or
writing or speaking or socializing and
having a good time and getting ideas out
of your head
brain dump journaling is a great way of
doing this and that is pretty much you
take a piece of paper
and you write out everything on your
mind
everything literally everything you let
thoughts trigger thoughts the problems
that you're experiencing the the
negative thoughts emotions it's it's an
awareness exercise you're becoming
self-aware and it's as we talked about
with what the default mode network is
it's that inward focus cognition you're
you're
self-reflecting and you're getting that
out onto paper to open up new mental
pathways to go down and you're clearing
or emptying your mind in quite literally
a physical way you're getting it out of
your mind and into tangible reality now
not only will brain dumping empty your
mind but it helps with sleep so i like
to brain dump journal at the end of my
days i like to
take my notebook as i'm like sitting on
the couch or something or just getting
ready for bed and just write out 10
things that are on my mind i feel like
that is the easiest way to reap uh good
benefits from this exercise so now we
are on to use so we've done fill empty
use and this is about using your brain
or getting into deep focused work or
just channeling all of that energy that
you have now the creative energy things
that are written in your notebook
written in your notes from filling your
brain you have a lot of uh
energy so to say to work with here and i
prefer to do this in the mornings
because that is when the the
distractions are not awake yet right
people aren't sending me messages uh i'm
not getting very many emails i can wake
up early and i can structure exactly
what i need to do and get it done and
man that morning momentum of
getting things done before like most the
average person even wakes up is
extremely fulfilling it's a great way to
start your day by building out a project
that is conducive to your goals having
something that you are working and
making progress on jim bros know this
where
when you have a goal like a weight goal
or a lift goal for let's say bench press
and you go and you consistently make
progress week by week in the gym there
is no better feeling and you just want
to stay in the gym like your entire life
is built around that
and
it it just you're in your own little
reality and it's so hard to uh really
care about anything this is one secret
to not caring what people think is just
to have
meaningful goals that you're making
progress on day in and day out so i want
to bring somewhat of a unique
perspective to
deep work right so i have three parts to
this so one is leveraged familiarity two
is ordered consciousness three is
connection to the unknown or just being
present so leverage familiarity is
pretty much getting into a routine so
making it habit making it so your body
automatically wants to get up and get
into that deep and focused work now you
can study habit formation for this but
what that does is it just it's a primer
right you sit down you know exactly what
you're gonna do and you get it done the
and this is where things come to play
where you have to be very intentional
about what you're going to start doing
and what you're going to work on for the
day and that's where ordered
consciousness comes into play or as i
like to call it focus framing so for
focus framing you need a goal you need
clarity on how to get there and then you
need to take action in the most simple
way possible so let's take writing a
newsletter or article for example if i'm
writing a blog article
the goal is to write let's say a
thousand words clear goal how do i get
there
well i outline it right clarity comes
from an outline so you outline okay i'm
going to talk about this this and this
and then in terms of like that low
friction action you just need to start
writing and so what this does is when
you are focused on this specifically and
you consistently remind yourself of this
one it's intention that's what you are
stretching towards
uh
you're much much much less likely to
check your phone or open another browser
tab or scroll social media because you
know exactly what you need to do
and there's no friction there there's no
split focus of like okay
i don't really know what i'm doing here
but social media came to mind so i can
go there no it's not like that you need
to
have that framed focus so now the third
one when i say connection to the unknown
or just being present i mean that you
need to approach your work from a state
of calm right it's going to be very hard
when you are stressing because stressing
is assuming that your
attention is split that you're focusing
on something in the future or the past
that has yet to happen or has already
happened and
it's just not gonna happen so before you
start your work take a few deep breaths
loosen all the tension and then go
straight into
that uh just writing the first word or
taking the first step or putting on your
shoe or walking outside or something
of that nature whatever the lowest
friction action is to get into that deep
focused work so that is it for this one
