when I first started out in business I
had no idea what I was doing I thought
it was obvious if I have a skill people
need that skill so they'll hire me I was
ignorant to the fact that every single
person could learn that skill and the
online freelancing Arena was starting to
become flooded with single skill
Commodities like web design and so that
was the first problem that I had to
solve and to cut to the chase I bought
courses on freelancing Facebook ads
e-commerce brand Building copywriting
Sales and client acquisition at least 15
web development courses that are
irrelevant but noteworthy and I didn't
see much success when I tried the
business models in those courses and
that's on me not them that's my
execution problem and lack of
uh the distinction between knowledge and
understanding right I can learn learn
all day and mentally masturbate but then
when it comes to actually executing and
bridging that Gap so turning knowledge
into understanding through experience
and actually playing the game like when
I can read the rules of the game all day
long and feel like I have a grasp on it
but unless I play that game for years
then I'm not going to get good at it I'm
not going to get good at make the skill
of making money and even if I think I'm
good at it it's usually because I'm
playing against a low level character
right in the game if I'm making ten
thousand dollars a month and I'm
surrounded by people making ten ten
thousand dollars a month then it feels
like I'm playing the game well but then
you get exposed to someone that's making
a million a month which yes it is a
thing then it's like oh I suck at this
game of business and so even though I
didn't see much success from the courses
I noticed a few patterns between them
all and one was very apparent right I
had to get specific on who I was
targeting with a product or service I
had to identify a starving market like
Health break that down into sub-markets
like bodybuilding and narrow in on a
niche market like minimalist training
and then research the people within that
market and collect data on them that way
I could hit their pain points and speak
to them directly and at this point it's
like oh it all makes so much sense this
was it I had the secret I knew I had to
find a specific person research them
know exactly what they need and then
tailor product or service to them with
the skill set that I've developed and
this is still it still works but the
thing is here is like
just Niche down bro that's all there is
to it and this is still common advice in
the online business space and I still
feel like it Sparks the most overwhelm
anxiety and uncertainty for beginners
and people don't realize that business
as well as any other domain of life it
evolves right if you get trapped in a
paradigm of oh cold Outreach is the best
cold email is the best this network
marketing strategy is the best and you
don't realize the power of personal
Brands and the emergence of the Creator
economy then you're eventually going to
get left behind because you can't change
your beliefs around it just like
religion nutrition Health as new things
emerge and we understand human existence
better then you have to adapt to those
times by consistently learning and so
beginners feel like if they don't find
the most profitable Niche they're going
to fail and so they spend their time
flopping from Niche to Niche learning
skills for that Niche which is not a bad
thing and end up with no money or
leverage to show for it that's a bad
thing and I like to challenge common
beliefs and more than just business I
feel like it's helped my personal growth
oh lot it's allowed me to launch ahead
of many people that are still in the
same position they were business-wise
and health-wise and every other domain
of life-wise quickly they're still the
same after three years while I've
developed changed and outgrown certain
methods and so the people that don't
challenge common beliefs they adopt the
beliefs of others like cold email or
cold Outreach has the best strategy and
only strategy and they get some they get
effective but not the best results for
the landscape that we are in and so that
was a brief intro but I just want to
make it known here that this video is
going to be very long this was arguably
the longest newsletter that I wrote
Because I like to bridge philosophy
business and all that other stuff and I
like to drag on a bit so if you want to
skip ahead to the actionable parts it's
usually going to be in the last section
maybe the last 10 to 15 minutes and you
can look in the chapters on YouTube and
all of the stuff that we're going to
talk about is important but if you want
to go to the Practical parts then I
understand I don't recommend it but in
those parts the last Parts we're going
to talk about out treating the evolution
of your brand as an actualization
hierarchy so you don't have to Niche
down how to build each level of your
brand from beginner to Advanced and
practical things to build at each level
so you know what to do right now and
that's in the last section you are the
infinite Niche I'm bringing A New
Concept to how you progress in your
brand growth as a Creator freelancer
coach consultant online business owner
and general agency owner anything in the
online business space because a personal
brand is business model agnostic so now
we have to loop back a bit go over my
story again because this is the mindset
this is the mindset shift that led to
this right mindset comes before
everything and so if you're in the space
and you can relate to it then you'll be
able to get further ahead if you
resonate with this mindset shift and
hopefully hopefully it can happen in you
so I don't know how or why but I was
scrolling Twitter one day after I
deleted it from my phone for
let's say eight years the only time I
remember using it before that was at
like a movie theater my friend told me
to download it I looked at it I was
following like two people I'm like this
app [ __ ] sucks I'm deleting it but
when I log back on eight years later I
noticed a tweet that caught my eye I
don't know how it got maybe it's the
universe just giving me divine
inspiration but I saw a guy that was
selling Web Design Services and at that
time I was selling web design and funnel
services to service businesses and so
I'm like oh [ __ ] okay there's something
here why is this guy on Twitter of all
places talking about this and he was
also talking about self-improvement
mindset harsh truths that I really loved
at the time and at the same time I was
conditioned into the mind that cold
calls cold emails direct Outreach was
really the only way to grow my business
without investing in something like paid
ads and so after years of trial and
error I never really saw the success
that I wanted to see I knew that it was
possible if I would have stuck it out a
bit more but like a year of not seeing
much results I was seeing better results
at this time because I had it locked
down I was making I quit my job and so I
was working full time on this at this
time but I still it's like how are these
people making a hundred thousand dollars
a month and I'm over here making six
eight ten occasionally and even further
I I felt like I wouldn't be able to
scale Beyond one person right I felt
like freelancing like Outreach itself
took up two hours of my day and then
client work took up the rest and you
guys know how big I am on the four hour
work day now like you understand that
this is kind of a necessity for that to
happen is personal branding and audience
building and so when I saw people like
the person talking about it was Jose
Rosado was talking about web design
shout out to him great account to follow
but when I saw people doing this and
Landing clients from it through their
promotions things started to click right
because with cold emails and DMS nobody
knew who I was there wasn't any prior
trust I didn't have a way of showing my
Authority or results from the start I
had to prove myself as one person it's a
lot of manual work if you want the
messages to be personal right not just
robotic and automated and every pitch I
sent either led to a customer or nothing
at all I wasn't building leverage along
the way and was social media content
warm Outreach to your audience and just
promotions on the timeline I create a
reputation over time I build trust with
span and depth short form and long form
content I can build trust in my audience
without having to explain myself to them
I can generate interest in my products
without trying nothing goes to waste all
content either contributes to data
failures or growth successes as I grow
larger I can evolve my brand into
something I enjoy doing I gain rather
than lose Freedom with time and effort
and so this is when I bought like a
Twitter growth course at the beginner
and I'm like oh this is kind of easy I'm
going to start doing this and then I saw
growth because I actually stuck to the
principles of the course because I knew
that in my past when I took courses I
never really applied what I learned then
I feel like that's a big problem with
people that take say my courses is that
they don't just do what I say and now
I'm kind of against prescriptions but as
a beginner prescriptions are very good
because then you get experienced by
actually feeling confident in that what
you're applying and then you start to
create your own and realize okay this
works better for me and then you grow
and so another problem with this and as
I said this is going to be long because
there's a lot that goes into it is that
when people start writing content they
feel like they have to stick to the one
interest that they are Niche down in the
niche they chose right so they put
themselves in the box from the beginning
and they don't realize that you are
interested in the topic related to what
you sell obviously that's your Niche but
you also follow 200 to 500 other people
with other interests that are completely
different you don't only follow people
that are in your Niche how in the world
can you believe that you can't talk
about other things when you yourself
read potentially 200 to 500 different
ideas across a plethora of different
niches you're interested in more than
one your clients are interested in more
than one and it's not that people won't
be interested in your other interests is
that you throw all writing advice and
any other social media growth advice out
the window when it comes time to writing
about these things because it's not
about finding people that are already
interested in it it's about introducing
an making people interested in it by
making your interest interesting to
other people and so people feel like if
they go broad rather than Niche they
will dilute themselves to the point of
not making any money and I called
[ __ ] on this early like when I I've
been preaching this since I started on
Twitter or any other social media
because if you look at every single
YouTuber podcast or other social media
celebrity public influence or whatever
they go broad like look at Iman godzi or
Hamza or Ali abdall like you whatever
you think about them they're successful
they went broad they focus on beginner
level education on top of funnel social
media and then they Niche down in their
courses newsletter communities Etc and
there's at least somewhat holistic in
the things that they talk about right
because they understand if you want to
be good at business and life in general
because that's why you're pursuing
business in the first place health
wealth relationships you should talk
about all of them because you can't be
you can't get to a certain level in
Business Without getting to a certain
level in health or mindset or
spirituality and so they are far ahead
because they understand human nature and
so think of it like this most brands are
a building within the community that is
social media I want my brand to be a
community in and of itself in the world
of social media and my newsletter
content products and services are the
buildings or the digital real estate so
while other people are building one
building and occupying little houses
inside of it I'm building a community
with multiple buildings and multiple
houses inside of it each building being
its own audience and its own Niche
because the only reason you Niche down
in the first place for the sake of
marketing is to sell more of your
product or service so Niche down on your
product or service not your entire brand
but here's the thing is you clearly have
to establish one building first you
can't just build an entire city and so
now let's open the can of human nature
so that you understand this so let's
let's start by understanding hierarchies
and stages of development hierarchies
are the foundation of existence and yes
even those that scream and cry about how
hierarchies are the page patriarchy is
bad they're still ranking the hierarchy
is bad which is a hierarchy hierarchy
within itself if you want to learn more
about this read a brief history of
everything by Ken Wilbur it'll actually
help you understand the whole patriarchy
matriarchy and how most people scream
about it nowadays are idiots and they
don't understand what's going on from
like a universally large perspective
throughout history and so the fabric of
reality is composed of units of mine
that's what I call it in my book that's
coming out soon the art of focus Alan
Watts has called them units of thought
Leo Guru has called them figments of
Consciousness uh Ken Wilbur calls them
hollons which is like his word for the
building blocks of reality but I prefer
the term units of mind because of the
philosophy of mentalism or that all is
mind because during animal life or
before the emergence of human
consciousness there was no mind to label
interpret and create language so that
everyone could be on the same page an
animal wouldn't it doesn't call this a
boom arm it doesn't call this a mic it
doesn't call that a cam camera doesn't
call this computer humans have
constructed and layered and evolved
language with time to distinguish and
make sense of everything in reality
because animals as an example are mostly
in the present moment they see all of
this as form in formation information
and energy it's all in formation in the
present moment it's a happening as Alan
wattswoods and so there's a few
characteristics of units of mind that we
want to understand here the first is
that units of Mind are hierarchical and
intimately connected with the world like
an atom to cell to molecule or a letter
to sentence to paragraph to book or
content to product to Brand to community
to social media or short form content to
medium form to long form and beyond that
any of those units are vertically and
horizontally connected to everything by
a proximal relationship and you can
think about this with anything right it
can be a room to an apartment to an
apartment complex to a city it's
literally everything everything is a
hierarchy but then they also connect to
each other so like how short form
content on the top a bodybuilding
connects to the gym connects to
nutrition connects to the fork in your
hand which connects to the micro
ecosystem in your gut the second thing
is that units of Mind are whole Parts
they are both a whole in and of
themselves like a human being and a part
of something greater like humans having
the desire to be a part of having a
purpose or something greater than
themselves and so a whole personal brand
or Creator or online business is nothing
without its parts and most people
neglect the need for each part in order
to evolve or collecting parts and
pushing to the next hole that they will
evolve into and we need to understand
that Dominator hierarchies here which
are the ones that give hierarchies a bad
reputation and make people want to
dismantle the patriarchy but they're
classified when a unit within the
hierarchy attempts to dominate like how
a cancer cell can replicate in the body
until it kills the host or dismantles
the hierarchy by killing a lower level
of it yeah at the cellular level what
cancer does is it removes a whole part
within your body that allows you not to
exist or just to die and so the cancer
cell has to be healed and reintegrated
in order for the hierarchy to continue
Healthy Growth and evolution and so the
third thing is that units of Mind emerge
transcend and include so by Nature fewer
craters or personal brands or online
businesses will reach the highest level
of the hierarchy let's think of the
highest level as Mr Beast Joe Rogan the
biggest people right because there can
only be so many people up there with
Millions upon millions of followers it's
just that's how it is and it's the same
with like even corporate jobs like you
can only rise so high in the latter but
the thing about the crater economy is
that it's not corrupt I mean it can be
corrupt but there's very few people it's
decentralized so people can't
necessarily dominate one level of the
hierarchy maybe for a time until they
evolve but think about it this way where
the amount of creators with a hundred
thousand followers are increasing
dramatically which is just just that
number alone is more than enough to make
more than enough money then you could
ever imagine wanting or needing and so
as the Creator economy continues to
evolve these levels will continue to be
created through emergence Transcendence
and inclusion and more people there will
be new highs of that hierarchy and there
will be new ways of development
horizontally within the crater economy
which means that you don't necessarily
need to gain a metric [ __ ] ton of
followers there's going to be other
opportunities available and they're
coming up every single day because it's
not like you have to create a digital
product business or have such a large
following that you can get sponsorships
or create a service you can work for
people within the Creator economy as an
entrepreneur unlike a job where yes jobs
are accepting remote work more often but
bigger creators are businesses within
themselves they have hundreds of other
creators working under them to make that
brand work like someone I was talking to
the other day wanted to get into
nutrition and they thought the only path
they could go was like getting hired at
a personal training thing or a
dietitian's clinic and it's like if you
know Merrick Health with Derek more
plates more dates you could go work for
them you can go work for an nutrition
coach and be their coach if they're big
enough in their coaching business is
successful enough you can go work for
really any other Creator and offer your
expertise that you've developed but the
underlying principles of creating a
personal brand in a valuable and
contributing to the actual Creator
society and economy is that you need a
brand to display yourself you need
content to show your Authority you need
an offer or value and that can be a
digital product service or just working
for someone else that's a service and
marketing or promotion you need all of
that no matter what you're doing I broke
that down in the last video you are a
whole and a part of your network which
is a part of a community which is a part
of the Creator economy which is part of
the internet and Beyond you must
exchange value through money which is
the lifeblood of any society in order
for it to survive for the Creator
economy to survive and you to actually
be a part of it you need to be
contributing value and receiving money
and paying money like value exchange
across the board and so now let's
understand your personal Evolution
because this can get very tricky very
quick everything goes through
developmental stages even your personal
brand and I've written about this in
depth the stages of Creator development
in the one-person business roadmap video
throughout all of this go watch the one
person business playlist and so without
over complicating this book on things
like stages of ego development or spiral
Dynamics or really anything let's just
simplify this with two examples first is
just beginner intermediate Advanced you
have to start out as a beginner you have
to practice you have to get results you
have to go to the intermediate stage and
then the advanced stage because
beginners won't have validated ideas
you're going to have to test ideas
you're doing different things at each
stage at the beginner stage you're
following a social media growth course
if you have problems with courses go and
[ __ ] sign up for a forty thousand
dollar degree and see if you get
anywhere in the crater economy not gonna
happen if you want to get a job then you
need to get educated by the things that
are going to educate you for a job AKA
College if you want to work in the
Creator economy then you're going to
have to be educated at a fraction of the
cost by people that are in the Creator
economy and that literally created it so
the second example is just the
pre-rational rational and post-rational
Stage that was kind of created by Ken
Wilbur I believe but this developmental
progression is best explained by the
Bell Curve me so here's the Bell curb
Meme and on the left you have low IQ
which is like I do whatever I want at
Mid IQ it's like no you have to Niche
down how are you going to land clients
if you aren't specific all the agency
owners say that you have to pick the
most profitable Niche being a Creator is
the same exact thing no question about
it you're an idiot if you try to be
yourself and then on the right super
high IQ I do whatever I want do whatever
you want when people start to develop
themselves in any area of Life they
latch on to specific teachings and
principles and related ideologies that
they are taught from the beginning that
are conditioned into their minds they're
brainwashed I'm not talking about just
the Matrix or being in the Matrix you
can very well be programmed into an
anti-matrix mindset by the people that
are trying to get you out of the Matrix
you just enter a new Matrix and so if
you don't continue to evolve or question
your beliefs then you get trapped in
that phase or that stage of development
and so it's like how religious people
become Bible Thumpers and regurgitate
hate everything they've learned without
questioning or understanding and then
they reach the intermediate stage or the
rational stage and this is where people
start to question and rebel against the
beginner stage and so in spiritual
domain of development this is where
atheists come into play and they're very
bitter they attack and they just argue
all day but in the Creator domain of
development in the intermediate stages
this is where people get bitter at the
game and I've seen this more recently it
usually comes in Cycles like on the
timeline where people are calling other
people out there's a lot of drama
there's a lot of people calling out
scammers which isn't a bad thing but
then there's also the people that just
complain all day about how the game's
not fair and then they lose followers
and they get sucked into the cycle of
their own doing or downward spiral of
their own doing where they're like oh
like I have to write content this way
and I'm not going to do it and I'm gonna
go all against what everyone's saying
and then oh why am I not getting
engagement you guys don't know what's
good content it's like you've just been
exposed to it to the point as to where
like you haven't accepted the game in
the system and how to maneuver yourself
within it and you weren't creative
enough to turn it into your own thing
and so they say things like everyone is
a copycat coaches selling to coaches or
running a pyramid scheme which is just a
lack of understanding of hierarchies and
another one is just High ticket sales is
the best business model because everyone
else is basic and not as smart as me
it's also my way of survival so I'm
deeply tied to it or else I feel
threatened again this can get very
dangerous and so lastly you evolve to
the post-rational stage of development
and in this stage you ReDiscover the
principles and can approach them from a
place of experience like how most
developed spiritual people agree and
embody the principles in the Bible so to
say or every other pattern across all
belief systems that point to truth
because truth isn't limited by cultural
understanding but but but they see the
futility in preaching it as the one and
only ideology like Christianity or else
you burn in hell and so in the Creator
economy we can note a few things is that
many intermediates despise simple
platitudes or cliches or just like
quote-like advice and they enter a
bitter phase and try to rebel against
the nature of business which is which is
good but like a a replicating cancer
cell you must take your discoveries and
be reintegrated into the hierarchy so
that you can advance to the next stage
or you destroy your business like I've
seen time and time again because you
just get upset and so Advanced creators
see those things as a pillar of growth
and so with that long background we can
now come at creating your Niche from a
place of metaphysical understanding so
I've discussed how you are the most
profitable Niche many times before
specifically in the video the most
profitable Niche is you and so this
video doesn't end up longer than it has
to be which it already is I'm just going
to give you a brief overview of what I
mean by you are the most profitable
Niche your brand vision is your vision
for the future this is what you're
leading your followers toward your brand
identity is your story where you came
from and how you transformed your
content illustrates this by educating on
the skills and interests you learned to
get to where you are your thoughts
opinions and world view are how you
position your content in a unique way
your products are the systems you've
created to help those behind you so
let's build on this idea by going deeper
and hopefully this provides more clarity
so here's a graphic right we're talking
about don't Niche down view your brand
as an actualization hierarchy so this is
the hierarchy of brand actualization and
just keep this in mind as we go about
right I'm not going to break it down
right now that's what we're here to
actually talk about screenshot it if
you'd like but you are complex at least
that should be your aim the universe
evolves toward complexity that's what
it's been doing like the information age
is the most complex age that we've ever
been in that's what I mean is before
this think of like years ago centuries
ago thousands upon thousands of years
ago the universe was a Little Acorn even
though it looked physically the same
this is why I like the philosophy of
mentalism because now the universe is
like an oak tree with a thick stump and
branches and branches on that and leaves
and everything with interconnections
within the leaves and all these little
things going on in the mental realm and
so if the universe evolves toward
complexity so do you as you learn
Implement and understand as you age and
so the complexity of your character is
determined by the the goals that you've
pushed through and each goal you achieve
requires a specific perspective and
skill level to match and the higher your
skill level across multiple domains the
higher your complexity of self and as
you increase in complexity you can work
to solve deeper and more meaningful
problems in your life and the lives of
others and if you are the niche then
your brand should go in complexity as
your skills and interests evolve in the
pursuit of your goals because your brand
what you're leading people towards is
goal after goal after goal that's how
you evolve and so as you learn and
acquire skills it is your duty to build
real world projects that get results for
other people and that is how you both
create a profitable product in business
and fulfill your spiritual duty of
feeling as if you are part of something
greater than Yourself by helping other
people at scale so with here here's the
key point is that with every level of
development that you reach you will
build a tangible product to reflect that
this is how you educate your followers
and build Authority after I solve the
productivity problem in my life I
created a power planner and I sold that
and then eventually made it a free
download after I got results with web
design and freelancing then I solidified
my knowledge and results and experience
within that domain by making it tangible
so that other people could learn so I
created a web design course how to
create websites and to create a
freelancing course of what I learned
along the way and this only furthered my
understanding within these things and
allowed me to transcend it and so after
I acquired a skill stack I created a
Consulting offer for Branding I was a
brand advisor because I had such
complexity at this point where I felt
like I could do it so well for other
creators and influencers and Brands now
what many people miss when it comes to
niching down is this they don't realize
that any newsletter lead magnet product
or service you create is an audience
you're building an audience off platform
the problem is that most people are
afraid they don't publish anything they
create content and think that's good
enough and they hide behind a service
they won't they don't put anything out
there in public because they're so used
to one-on-one work and freelancing is
like oh this isn't in public so I'm not
going to be scrutinous eyes are
criticize when that's what leads to
growth and they don't realize that long
form content products and services are
the backbone of your entire brand and I
don't want to sound egotistical but this
illustrates the example well because
I've seen this very frequently right
people think Twitter is going to [ __ ]
and they'll talk to me they'll like Dan
you have very good engagement
like how do you do it all my Twitter
clients are like their engagement's
going to [ __ ] and it's like hmm I wonder
why I've been practicing what I preach
for years now with writing long-form
newsletters YouTube videos podcasts
creating eight to ten lead magnets
products iterating on those products
evolving them creating a community a
service I'm always building something
literally every single quarter for the
entirety of me doing this the first hour
of every morning I was building a
product or service and I was trying to
sell it and do you know what that led to
did it lead to me being overly salesy no
it led to audiences consuming that
information changing their life because
it's ten times more deep than anything
on social media can be just by the
nature of it it's a hierarchy and
because of that they read my content
from a lens of more experience because
I'm helping them gain that experience
people read my content from an
understanding of who I am and My
Philosophy anyone can copy and paste my
tweet but it's going to get half the
engagement because I'm not the one
posting it you are the niche and so
here's the the thing is that my brand is
the vessel for my life's work my brand
is not a niche audience in the in a
couple years I'm getting into music
production right now I don't hold me to
that I may stop I may quit but at the
same time what if I created Focus work
playlists for my audience as content
right not the typical music production
route where I'm trying to become famous
and go on stage create gym playlists
create focused work playlist create
spirituality music and help people
integrate Into My Philosophy more and so
my brand is a city within social media
and it's a community of millions of
people so my power planner has a 70 000
downloader Niche audience around
productivity this is digital real estate
I am occupying my newsletter has 120 000
subscriber Niche audience around depth
philosophy and business my products have
a 15 000 Plus student Niche audience
around writing branding and business
when you Niche down your brand I see
people maybe get to a hundred thousand
total followers after three years my
power planner is a more Niche audience
than the niche audience that grew to 100
000 over three years and it has 70 000
people on it and so do you see what I'm
getting at here by doing this this is
how you remove the boundaries around who
you are online in the Digital Society
and build whatever the [ __ ] you want
with time so now let's let's take it
back a bit here because we have to
understand that everyone starts at level
one because you aren't just going to
build all of these things in a blink of
an eye as I said it took me quarter
after quarter after quarter that's like
three months where I would build launch
iterate get feedback and build the next
thing so you have to set your mind on
building the first level of the pyramid
and then once that project emerges you
can try you can start to transcend to
the next by building another product or
project and most people never evolve
because they stop building and they get
stagnant it's like oh I'm only going to
write content for the next three years
of my life I'm not going to create a new
product I'm not going to create a new
service I'm not going to contribute
anything more to this new society that I
call myself a part of you aren't helping
with the growth of the society by
educating you're the school system right
the creator of society is everything
it's the school system it's the
government it's tribes it's everything
and we are creating it so now let's get
into some actionable [ __ ] right this is
the Smart progression for authority and
growth and this is what I would
recommend as a beginner level
progression so number one is to
determine two to three topics that lead
to your vision here's a graphic from the
previous post I did on how to write
social media content and this is what I
mean by choosing two to three topics and
then being able to break them down into
subtopics and just ideas that you can
start writing about and so what do these
topics fall under one you should already
know what they are you have interest but
aside from that you have to determine
what you're leading your followers
towards you have to understand at least
somewhat what your vision for the future
is or what the next goal you want to
achieve is right in health wealth
relationships happiness and from there
what skills and interests are going to
take you there because anyone can start
working on their finances but one person
is going to be more interested in
starting the e-commerce business or the
personal brand or budgeting or just a
physical small business like opening a
coffee shop right that is your skill or
interest to get you to that goal and
that is unique to you so step number two
is to practice top of funnel writing and
growth because your number one priority
is consistent brand growth on social
media and the the easiest ones to grow
on are Twitter Instagram LinkedIn and
other short form platforms like Tick
Tock or shorts or I don't recommend
those but it's because you're more in
control of your growth with Tick Tock
you're still relying on the algorithm
with Twitter LinkedIn Instagram you can
Network and help each other grow and
build your tribe so that your tribe can
rise to new levels of the hierarchy
right people are so against engagement
groups or Mastermind groups when again
you don't understand what a Syndicate is
you don't understand what a tribe is
within the community and you
rising up in status and the other thing
with this is that you want to build a
base audience where you can fuel your
digital real estate and products and
services over time and eventually
transfer to longer form platforms right
you need an audience to fuel your
newsletter you need an audience to grow
on YouTube potentially if you don't want
to rely on the algorithm I like to be in
control of my [ __ ] and so I grew a
Twitter audience and I'm like eventually
I want to get on YouTube I'm just going
to transfer that audience over and that
takes time too but I knew that if I just
went straight into YouTube I probably
would never see success it was very low
chance because I can see the market I
understand what's going on and so on my
Twitter I can control this and so that
made more sense to me so as your
audience grows your leverage to build
and talk about whatever you want does
with it so buy best-selling books on
your topics and devour them follow
social media accounts that talk about
those topics and emulate them from the
lens of a Creator not a consumer pay
attention to what writing ideas and
structures perform the best that's how
you practice writing and you're going to
suck at first so get it out of the way
while nobody's watching while you have
zero to 200 followers and I talk about
all of this in to our writer right if
you want to learn how I write or just
writing in order to grow as the
foundation of all social media check it
out and so the third thing is to start a
newsletter as a vessel to build your
projects because I always recommend
starting a newsletter and you don't have
to start writing one on a consistent
basis you just have to have the
newsletter you need to be practicing
promoting it marketing it so you can get
subscribers on there but you don't have
to be consistent with it and people
procrastinate building a newsletter
because all these limiting beliefs come
up and it's like oh I'm not gonna write
oh this is too long term I don't even
have an audience yet and it's because
you you don't see you don't see
immediate results from it so it's not
enticing to you because you don't
understand another perspective behind it
and so the benefits to starting a
newsletter are that you can practice
developing depth behind your ideas this
leads to original thought and struggle
with writing you get better faster you
can use it as a place to write modules
or sections of your lead Magnet or
products no it doesn't matter if you
send it out for first for free and you
show that you're providing value off
platform as a beginner which helps with
perceived Authority because selling
something helps your brand not selling
something hurts your brand and so
whenever you create something in the
next steps that we're going to talk
about you use your newsletter as a way
to write the first iteration of it and
so you're getting this content out and
you're gaining Authority by writing
long-form content on it that some people
can see and so step number four is to
create a lead magnet as your first Niche
because I've built and tested eight to
ten different lead magnets from just a
simple web design video is literally an
hour long video on how I create websites
to the basics of marketing to the power
planner to seven days to genius ideas to
the internet profit starter pack to the
path to power which was like an ebook on
my life philosophy because people with a
niche brand consistently have to talk
about the one topic that they're Niche
down into and so let's take video
editing as an example and this applies
to any other interest from Health
Nutrition Marketing sales philosophy
anything and so if I create a lead
magnet on the basics of video editing do
I always have to worry about writing
content on that or can I Branch into
something new because if I incorporate
some video editing content here there I
just plug my lead magnet and then people
have everything I could ever want to say
about that thing right in their hands
and it's extremely valuable and I build
my newsletter along the way because I'm
capturing emails and so here's a short
example of lead magnet ideas is just
checklists that get results like a web
design checklist notion templates for
systems like writing or habit formation
beginner level ebooks that go over the
fundamentals to get people up to speed
with more advanced stuff that you talk
about or video tutorials or screen
recordings of the same beginner
fundamentals so create a lead magnet to
establish Authority in the area that you
want to monetize or at least you think
you want to monetize because you can
always create another lead magnet it
takes like a day and so over time you
will build a niche audience of
downloaders under your much broader
audience of your brand and then over
years upon years if you want to Branch
into Health then you do the same thing
if you want to Branch into music
production then you do the same thing
you are the most profitable Niche and so
step number five is to sell a minimum
viable service offer to gain experience
right we I showed you the complete uh
self or brand actualization hierarchy
earlier but we're creating a much
shorter one here where it's content lead
magnet service and then you're going to
fill in product or and so what we're
doing here is we're creating a smaller
hierarchy to start and then we can add
levels along the way so we're doing
content newsletter lead magnet service
and then we can eventually add in
product coaching event whatever you want
to add in and the reason we're doing
this is because you need a next step or
a monetizable way to help the lead
magnet downloaders that want more what's
the next logical step after the lead
magnet they download and how are you
going to help them do that with a
minimum vile viable freelance or
coaching offer and so I've discussed
this before in its own video which is
the best online business model to make a
million dollars in 2023 but you're doing
a single skill freelance service like
web design or single interest coaching
service like Health coaching and then
you charge 500 2 000 and you slowly
evolve that hierarchy by increasing your
prices increasing your experience
systemizing your process getting results
Etc and with this you can replace your
income with just like three to four
clients and then go full time and then
start developing your brand further so
step number six is to denish evolve
transcend and include because at this
point you've developed Authority in one
Niche whichever you created the lead
magnet and service around right but
you're still able to talk about whatever
you want in your content or newsletter
because you've already established
you've already written the content
before and can plug that with the lead
magnet so to deepen your Authority and
open up room to explore new interests
you should complete your brand
actualization pyramid turn your
freelance or Consulting service into a
cohort based course get results at this
level productize that cohort into a
digital product get results at this
level repeat the process of lead magnet
service cohort and product until you
have a holistic synthesis of content
products and services and if you want to
talk about certain interests you need
foundational content like a lead Magnet
or newsletter in place to get people up
to speed and if you aren't getting
engagement when you start talking about
a new interest it's because you haven't
developed depth under it you haven't you
don't realize that your audience is not
on the same page of understanding as you
and that's why you need to start
beginner level and introduce them to it
in a persuasive manner study persuasion
so with it with time and effort with
within one or two years you can really
start doing whatever you want and so
this is really the way to become a
modern polymath or a digital Renaissance
Man by exploring reality through your
interests and distributing your
discoveries through content and making a
living doing what you love by creating
something worth charging for so flow
with the direction of the universe and
bask in the enjoyment that comes with it
and enjoy the rest of your day because
that's the end of the video and if you
liked it like the video if you liked it
again like the video subscribe
description for tour writer course
digital economics masterclass the lead
magnets that I talked about throughout
the actual thing hopefully you watched
as far if you did I appreciate you let
me know how you like this new setup and
me like looking this way if it feels
kind of weird but
we'll run with it
peace
