what is up my friends
dan co modern mastery
i don't know if i'm gonna do that but
i'm keeping it
it's dan cope with modern mastery
welcome back to another video today i
want to talk about the one mindset shift
that will
absolutely change and transform your
life you have my attention i know that
kind of title is cringe and platitude
but it's so true because the
mindset shift here is cope
to curiosity right polarity they exist
on other sides of the spectrum i'm not
sure what to do with my hands and what i
mean by this and why this has come to
mind so much is because i've been
growing on tick tock right and i've seen
this on other social media platforms
like i've seen it on twitter because i
have a big following i've seen it
sometimes on youtube i've seen it on
instagram
good for you but just
closed-mindedness
and cope right so on tick-tock i posted
a video
right here of me and it was like my
seven rules to a productive day right
and i included um
work in 45-minute blocks and go on a
15-minute walk in between and that's
what i do i work three to four
hours a day because i have built my
business to this point of being able to
do that and people tick-tock so keep in
mind that it's tick tock and you
shouldn't pay any attention to the
comment warriors on there i hate you i
hate you too
but what someone said stuck out to me
because he's like some of us have jobs
correct and so my first initial reaction
i was just like cool
and then the next thing he said under
that and he's like and some of us don't
grow up with rich parents and it's like
who hurt you
holy what kind of coke and
closed-mindedness and just assumptions
and expectations is this right my mom is
a school bus driver and a cashier at
walmart right
i did not come from a rich family and i
will continue promoting this message
that anyone that wants to can make as
much money as they want but they're just
stuck in their head and they don't
actually do things that will result in
that they don't they can't focus for a
long period of time mainly because of
just the modern world in general i talk
about this a lot because that's the main
thing that people up with that
this guy
well one
this guy is coping right it's like oh
you have rich parents oh you have
uh like some of us have jobs and it's
like oh what you're coping with the fact
that you have a job and you're not
curious this mindset shift you're not
curious in either what i do or
in your ability to leave that job
and do something better yes it's going
to be hard yes it's going to
take some work like an hour or two
after work or before work for
a year
okay but what else are you gonna do you
don't like your job
are you stuck there
you can quit anytime you want of course
there's money on the line and you have
to do stuff in the opposite direction to
build up an income source for yourself
but jesus christ like this
comes into play in so many different
areas that i see and it all comes down
to two things it's expectation and
assumption which 99 of the time if not
100 of time is absolutely
useless for
anything right because assumption right
first off this is this is how humans
make sense of things through stories
concepts metaphors and other things if
you don't understand something
the only things that you can do is
either is assume or expect
or be curious and question right that's
the mindset shift we're going for here
it's either closed-mindedness or it's
open-mindedness do you see what i'm
saying like if you
assume or you expect you're closing off
whatever potential was there for a
better life or a better way of doing
things now the thing with this is is
like expectation oh
life is hard life is hard i have no
motivation okay
who the said it wasn't supposed to
be hard who conditioned you to think
that it wasn't supposed to be hard right
life something that is completely
uncontrollable and so vast that you have
no way of controlling it or even making
sense of it that assuming and expecting
and trying to make sense of it is
against the point and it's only
going to result in pain and suffering
and it seeming hard right you see all
these people like david goggins that
just run all day and put themselves
through the ringer and jocko willing and
all these discipline is everything
people
they don't see it as hard they may say
like oh do the hard thing first it's not
hard to them they don't think of it as
hard they just do it it's normal to them
they've done it enough times to where
it's normal it's habitual it's familiar
to them that like all of that uncomfort
and discomfort is their regular way of
going about life and and
all of that stuff assuming
telling a story you're quite literally
because humans make sense of things
you're never going to have access to
another person's state of mind like mine
and assuming that i have rich parents
you're never going to
have access to my state of mind so the
only thing you can do
is tell stories to yourself about what
you think like about what your
assumption is so you can make sense of
what i'm doing
to your limited perception of me right
now we can dive into that a lot more but
i just want you to understand and plant
that seed of awareness in your head that
it's completely useless to do
that and you are not you're only causing
suffering to yourself right you need to
become aware of this so you can work
to go in the opposite direction now
what i would encourage you to do because
this isn't a process that happens
overnight right it really isn't it's
practice it's development it's growth
the like growth and development infer
that there are going to be roadblocks
there are going to be stumbling points
that it's not going to be
uh
perfect the first time around you have
to grow you have to overcome certain
things and so
with that process you have to
switch or at least prime the switch to
open-mindedness right you have to sit
now that you're aware of it and you
understand like the
downfalls of that weight line of thought
then
when it happens next time you have to
stop you have to pause and this is when
you pause and you become aware of that
thought you're in the present moment
you're conscious of it right you're
conscious of it and now this is the
crucial turning point this is where the
mindset shift happens when you pause and
you start to condition yourself to think
another way think in a positive way that
will result in an optimal reality for
yourself this is how you create your own
reality is when you catch that negative
thought pattern come in coming into your
head you pause
and now you question metacognition is
what it's called you think about your
thoughts and you question them and you
uncover whether they're rational or not
and you decide what to do or reframe in
the next way and questioning also
implies curiosity because you're curious
about oh this negative thought is in my
head
what's next right and you have to be
open-minded change it and you have to
slowly but surely reframe and recreate
these thought patterns in your head so
you can start to move from
a metaphorical poverty to
a metaphorical abundance right of
confidence and all these other things
that stem from nature when you stop
letting your ego take reign when you are
conscious fully conscious and aware you
are at one with nature like you were
when you were a child right when you
were a child you were confident creative
loving you cared about certain things
you would go outside more right you're
at one with nature you embody all of
these positive characteristics that were
shrouded over by the illusion of
negativity and your ego and the
conditioning that you've been fed
throughout all of your life so i'll
