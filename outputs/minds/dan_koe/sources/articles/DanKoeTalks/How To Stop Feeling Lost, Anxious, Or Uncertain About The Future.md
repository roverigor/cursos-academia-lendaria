problems are not personal problems are
systemic everyone has these same
problems and they will continue to have
the same problems the only thing you can
change is how you perceive your problems
which then leads to better decision
making without being so impacted by
emotion here's a cool graphic I made the
outer circles represent your perspective
the inner circles the white circles
those represent the problem so the more
zoomed in on the problem you are as you
can see in the left the bigger the
problem becomes the more it becomes your
reality and the more you zoom out like
on the right the problem becomes smaller
and smaller because you can see that it
is just a pixel that is a part of a
beautiful image and so it's a given that
the bar on the bottom where the more
zoomed in on a problem you are the more
it is your attention is immersed in it
or the more it occupies your
Consciousness or attention then the more
anxiety the stress and overwhelm you're
going to have one way you can test this
out and kind of become conscious of it
in real time is to drink a ton of coffee
and then watch your mind as it will zoom
in on the smallest little things because
of the stress response right if you
induce a stress response in your body by
let's say consuming too much caffeine
and then you start to notice these
little problems and then they immerse
your attention and you can't even
remember like oh what was I supposed to
do later today you can't remember the
Finer Things in life in that state of
stress and so in this video I want to
give you a new perspective on problems
so that we can solve them and towards
the end I want to give you a way or
something that you can bring your focus
back to at any given moment to live a
better life and not be so
restrained or chained down by your
problems anxiety overwhelm stress and
any other negative emotion you can think
of is the result of psychic entropy
psychic equals of the Mind entropy
equals that systems tend toward disorder
if your mind is a system then if energy
is not consistently fed into that system
to produce a desired end result if order
is not maintained in your mind then it
tends toward Disorder so if your mind
was a room and you do not put energy or
effort into cleaning that room then your
room is going to get dirty it's going to
get dirtier and dirtier over time the
first day it may not seem like it's that
dirty there may be a few things out of
place here and there but after a week a
month a year I'm sure many of you have
experienced this or even just walked
into someone's room and there's clothes
everywhere the bed isn't made there's
 all over the desk it's just a
complete mess and that means that the
more that your mind or really anything
because your body's a system your
relationships are a system everything
that leads to a desired outcome is a
system anything where you are trying to
receive or achieve a goal is a system
and so when those systems aren't
maintained with energy or effort or in
the case of let's say your body it could
be the food that you're eating whatever
the input is to lead to the output if
that isn't maintained in a positive
manner then those systems are going to
become more disordered over time and it
is going to require much more energy and
effort to fix that system and so
everyone is living in a pigsty of a mind
I would argue that 95 percent of people
have outsourced most of the things that
they have control over they've
outsourced their mental health to let's
say social media to get those
pleasurable dopamine hits so they can
feel good about themselves because they
lack effort in consuming better
information learning self-educating and
producing information because input
output you have to have that energy flow
you need to take energy in and you need
to put energy out so it's it's no wonder
that anxiety and all these other things
are plaguing our society more than they
ever have there's no wonder that mental
health issues are on a rise across the
board is it the whole case of the
chemical imbalance yes but I don't think
people understand what they're saying
when they actually say that yes some
people they have a chemical imbalance
everything you put into your body is a
chemical and so if that chemistry let's
say in the system is not maintained
through the means available to you
whether it be natural unnatural whatever
it may be chemistry is chemistry if it
doesn't check out or there is something
off then that disorder is going to occur
there is a blockage there and as Anthony
Demello says remove the obstruction from
your mind and you have peace remove the
obstruction from your heart and you have
love and I would go as far to say remove
the obstruction from your business and
you have money remove the obstruction
From Any Given system and you have
result so mental health in
the general sense I'm not a doctor here
and I know that you and I both have
experienced how crazy people can get and
defensive people people can get about
their mental health and how they kind of
hide behind that I'm not saying that
you're wrong I'm just saying why not
exhaust every single solution available
to you and I am providing a solution
that has worked for me and many others
because in this sense mental health is
about making sense understanding and
Clarity if you let a compulsive and
negative thought hijack a situation
let's say you're talking to another
person and a negative thought pops into
mind like oh I have to get this
done and then you feel the stress that
is associated with that alternate
situation that you are projecting into
then you can't make sense of the current
one because your mind is influenced by
something that is not even
relevant at that point so the lesson
with all of this and this little intro
is that your problems are as big as you
make them you have to understand that
your problems are normal that everyone
has problems and that there are always
two sides to the same coin if there is a
problem there is also an opportunity on
the other side of that coin that you are
not seeing because your mind is not open
enough because you're so laser focused
on the problem itself so problems aren't
special and when they are put into
perspective or when they are viewed from
the top of the mountain or from the big
picture they seem very small and stupid
an example is for my creators out there
or my business people is why are you
getting so worried that your social
media post on this given day at this
given time with this given state of mind
that you were in when you wrote it is
getting zero engagement when a child in
a third world country has come to accept
that he is not going to have water the
next day and he is perfectly okay with
that how is that child in a better
mental space than you I'm not asking you
to answer that question I am asking you
to think about it so by gaining
perspective on your problems you create
the space to zoom your attention out and
from that the problem shrinks from the
size of the world to the size of a
breadcrumb so the next question is how
do you maintain the order in your mind
to avoid the dreaded anxiety overwhelm
stress and other negative emotions that
we face on a daily basis like worry you
do it by creating your own reality Dan
bro what what the what the does
that even mean creating your own reality
let's start with the common saying that
your thoughts create your reality and
they do but what makes those thoughts or
your reality good or bad so if our
beliefs or our perceptions are
programmed or conditioned into our mind
as we age and as we grow up through the
school system
our parents and the people we interact
with and the inevitable socialization
that we have to go through to
differentiate ourselves from other and
our beliefs tend to automate our
thoughts do we just accept that we have
no control over this and accept the
emotional baggage that comes along with
an automated perception of our thoughts
that are automated from our beliefs and
just living a robotic and mechanical and
very reactive life that you think you
have control over but you don't that my
friends is what we call a puppet an NPC
or non-player character in a game or
just an emotional light switch that
people can turn off and off angry happy
angry happy so to reverse this effect or
at least understand this we need to
understand two things one your
perspective which is the angle position
or frame that you were viewing a
situation from and then your perception
so how you interpret that situation is
it problem attic or is it beneficial is
it associated with one of your goals and
is it conducive to that goal are you
misinterpreting it in an irrational way
that is going to make you act in a way
that leads to self-sabotage and you not
achieving your goal in that situation so
when you combine these two together I
like to think of it as a camera right
perspective is the camera itself you can
move it you can view the world from
different angles you can kind of mold
your mind to see from someone else's
camera and understand where they're
coming from you can also understand that
your perspective is singular and you
will never ever ever have the big
picture and so most situations where you
get triggered or offended you're usually
missing a piece of the puzzle I talked
about a pixel being a part of an image
and when you only see a cluster of
pixels and a huge image you're going to
come to assumptions and expectations and
have negative emotions around that
because you just aren't open-minded
enough to think that there is a bigger
picture in that situation so that's
perspective but then both of them so
perspective and perception perspective
is the camera and then perception is the
lens so assumptions expectations
judgments negative emotions are when the
lens is blurred it's only when you see
those cluster pixels rather than the
entire image for what it is and the
combination of both of those is focus
because you have to focus your camera on
a specific part of that situation or
that picture and so in my eyes the
definition of focus is conscious
attention and when you peel everything
back when you peel everything back
habits aren't the most important thing
whatever other self-help people tell you
is not the most important thing there is
only one thing that you truly have a
root control over that leads to every
other thing you do your thoughts actions
whatever it may be on a long enough time
scale and that is focus which is
conscious attention that is the only
thing that you can truly control that in
packs everything else that you can
somewhat control your thoughts emotions
and actions because at the end of the
day your unconscious is your unconscious
things are programmed into your
unconscious and you are not going to be
able to get away from that the only
thing you can do is when that compulsive
unconscious thought pops into your
conscious mind are you going to give it
conscious attention from and be able to
mold your camera or your perspective to
see it from a conducive
angle that will lead to you achieving
your goals or just not being an
emotional wreck about whatever problem
comes up in that situation so in the
terms of in in the case of systems and
your mind being a system and attention
being a way of processing information
that's what we do as human beings we
process information information holds a
certain frequency so if you hear the the
woo-woo people where they're like
everything is vibration or positive
vibes only there is some science behind
it where what you pay attention to you
are processing a frequency of energy and
so if your mind is a system and systems
need energy to be maintained or just to
flow properly and lead to beneficial
outcomes then you need to be very
conscious with where you place your
attention and how you interpret the
information that is coming into your
mind do not take this lightly
Consciousness you can hear about it from
ancient Masters spirit virtual gurus who
whatever it may be entrepreneurs they
talk about it from the lens of focus
like focus is the best thing that led to
the most benefits in my life and then
ancient Masters uh they talk about
non-duality and all this other stuff and
then spiritual teachers they're like
Consciousness Consciousness
Consciousness there's so many different
patterns here relating to attention
because in reality that is the only
thing you have so the cure to anxiety or
overwhelm or stress or worry is to
always act with intention this is the
simplest thing that we can break it down
into is to always act with intention and
this intention is to operate within your
own reality and not project outside of
it or when you're interacting with other
people let's say in a social situation
or in your relationships you need to
create a shared reality where projecting
outside of that reality you know that
it's going to that's just going to cause
problems or if you're both talking from
your own perspectives and one doesn't
understand another because it's not a
shared perspective and you haven't
created that reality that you can act in
with shared goals and other things of
that nature then the problems are going
to arise that's what the problems are
and there isn't going to be a system
your reality to maintain so think about
this does a bodybuilder care if he
brings chicken and rice as his own meal
to dinner yes he does care but only if
he projects outside of his reality which
means he loses control of his attention
if he remembers what is important to him
and his goals and he is able to perceive
the situation and the little Jabs of
insecurity that other people are
throwing at him accurately then he won't
care because he is focused so we have to
exchange robotic living for intentional
living if that bodybuilder let's say was
robotic someone would be like oh you're
bringing chicken and rice to dinner and
you'd be like what the like
like I don't know what he would say you
can you can assume what he would say
where it's like yeah I bring chicken
rice to dinner or yeah I don't know I
was thinking about having this that and
the other rather than maybe just joking
it off and being like yeah yeah I gotta
or he explains his perspective and his
goals and if other people don't accept
that then what can you do so the word
intention from the Latin word intentio
is stretching or purpose so my question
to you is what are you stretching
towards that is what you can bring your
focus back to in order to gain a better
perspective and accurately perceive a
situation the bodybuilder is striving
towards a better physique if he adopts
the goals of someone else which is
outside of his reality where their goals
are just to have a very pleasurable meal
and those goals don't align and he
sacrifices his values to pursue their
goals then he's going to feel like
and a bunch of problems are going to
come up that he would have easily been
able to avoid if he brought his
attention back to the simple what am I
stretching towards because this is how
you live a life of purpose rather than a
life of meaninglessness right intention
or stretching towards something implies
that there is a why behind your actions
if you do not have a why behind what
you're doing then why are you doing it
if you ask yourself why am I doing this
and you don't like the answer why are
you doing it and the usual thing is when
you either don't like the answer you
don't have an answer for why you were
doing specific things it's because
you've kind of turned on autopilot you
have gone into survival mode you are
just going about going through the
motions of life as you were programmed
to do because your unconscious brain can
process and manage up to 11 million bits
of information per second compared to
your conscious mind being able to
process 40 to 50 bits of information per
second that is a ton everything you do
walking possibly even peeing little hand
gestures like this that I'm not giving
my conscious attention are automatic and
you can switch into automatic mode if
you do not remain aware focused and
intentional about what you were doing on
a daily basis and then you have no idea
where these negative problems are coming
from you have no idea where the negative
emotions are coming from you think
they're just happening to you rather
than you being in control of them and
being able to
have this inner game or mental game that
allows you to get out of those
situations so how do we get out of this
state of feeling lost anxious and
uncertain about our future it's through
building actively constructing a better
life for yourself stretching towards
something and along the way building
Brick by Brick by Brick by Brick by
Brick to get there and you have to
understand that these words are
intentional building constructing you
don't build a house in a day and think
about this metaphorically if you're
trying to build a better life for
yourself
how long does it take to build a mansion
right a pretty long time how long does
it take to even see anything above
ground for that Mansion how long does it
take to lay a foundation maybe six
months I'm not a construction guy but
you're not even going to see results for
six months you're not going to see
anything that you can show other people
for six months because you have to lay
the groundwork you have to de-program
you have to chisel down and rebuild back
up so here's what you need to do is one
set a meaningful goal this is what trips
people most people up because you can
read any statistic about 99 of people
not following through with their New
Year's resolutions or just a way too
many people not having goals in general
not having something that they're
stretching towards not having something
that they can put energy towards and so
the next question is Dan how do I create
this meaningful goal as you say and if
you don't know then you don't know okay
that's what a lot of people struggle
with is I don't know what to do so the
only thing you can do there is literally
only one thing you can do if you don't
know you have to try new things so you
can know what you don't like because
flip side of the coin once you know what
you don't want you understand what you
want more because
that's the thing you can't really
directly experience exactly what you
want the first time around it just
doesn't happen it doesn't make sense you
may think you want it but then you try
something else and you're like that's
better that's worse that's even better
that's worse it's a process you're never
going to have the perfect answer for
this the meaningful goal to you is going
to be more so like I think I want this
so I'm going to work I'm going to work
towards this on a daily basis and pivot
along the way if I have to so try that
new business model start learning about
that new interest of yours buy a course
enroll in college if you want to you
don't have to listen to people that say
certain things are bad if it's something
you genuinely want to do and try out for
yourself and given time you'll know when
it's time to go all in you'll feel that
feeling of excitement that's what you're
looking out for is the dopamine that
comes from visualizing a better future
for yourself so step two is to create a
system because now we have a meaningful
goal we have something out there that we
don't have too much Clarity on and we
will never have Clarity on because it's
so far away from us you there's a gap
you can't have Clarity on exactly what
it's going to be like because you don't
have it right now right so you have to
bridge that Gap by creating a system and
gaining Clarity on how to get there
because this is such a big skill that
nobody talks about is becoming a
strategist the highest paid individuals
are The Visionaries the innovators the
strategists of the world rather than the
manual labor workers that are just
acting out repetitive non-leverigable
actions on a daily basis for someone
else so that's what you need to do here
is become a strategist I can't give you
a system for creating a system the best
way to do this is by one contemplating
and visualizing a goal that you want to
achieve opening your mind to having a
vision and gaining that excitement for
the the future rather than being so
focused and closed-minded on one little
problem that you aren't able to see the
full picture so sit down for 30 minutes
today tomorrow as soon as you possibly
can right now and just start drawing
start writing start writing what do I
want for the future because if you have
all of these thoughts in your head and
you aren't able to figure out okay what
do I want and what do I do to get there
you're not going to figure it out in
your head you just frankly aren't it's
like pretend that there is a water
filter or just a spigot and before clear
water comes out you have to push out all
the dirty water right that's what
writing and getting things on paper does
is it opens your mind and it takes those
open Loops out of your head and gets
them somewhere so you don't have to
compulsively think about them over and
over and over again now the other thing
is that with a system you have to
understand that it is a process it is
not like I'm gonna do this today and
then another thing tomorrow and another
thing the next day you need to
self-educate on how exactly you're going
to achieve that goal and that goal is
going to be achieved by doing the same
thing every single day if you want to
grow on social media you need to post
every single day you need to reach out
to people every single day you need to
work to get eyes on your brand every
single day if you want to gain muscle
you have to lift every single day but
also it's a process so you have to pay
attention like I'm gonna recover this
day and you have to eat every single day
you have to do things on a daily basis
and immerse your attention in the things
that will lead to your goal so step
number three after that is to Channel
all of your energy toward that goal in
that process so we're already getting
some energy from the intrinsic energy
that comes from pursuing a meaningful
goal that's dopamine that's fuel so the
next type of energy is extrinsic so you
are are channeling all of your thoughts
emotions and actions toward that
specific goal you're going to reframe
every single thing in every single
situation that you encounter in
relationship to your goal you're going
to perceive and see the situation or the
problem or whatever it may be from the
perspective of your goal if I want a
healthy physique then when I go out to
eat I'm going to view it from that
perspective I'm going to view that
situation from that reality I have this
goal of achieving this physique
am I going to eat this food or am I
going to eat this food if I do choose
this food am I going to care what people
think about it or am I going to eat it
anyways and not let them project their
own goals and reality on me and so
that's exactly it as you are going about
day-to-day life
think about the why behind your actions
think what kind of energy you are going
to be channeling into your goals with
every single action you take and this
isn't only for one goal this is for
mental goals financial goals spiritual
goals uh relationship goals body goals
whatever it may be what is your vision
for the future how are you going to get
there and why are you acting in a
specific way in a conscious way on a
day-to-day basis that is it for this
