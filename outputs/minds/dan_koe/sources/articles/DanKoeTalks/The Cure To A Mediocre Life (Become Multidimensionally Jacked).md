for some reason I've always had the
drive to max out every area of my life I
saw Life as a video game My Mind Body
Spirit and finances were the traits that
I had to gain experience in I wanted to
become multi-dimensionally jacked maybe
because I started questioning the
default path early maybe because I
noticed how unhappy overweight and
miserable people seemed maybe because I
observed how people limited their
opportunities by taking a specific path
in life it didn't make sense to follow
what most people do because that would
lead to a life that most people have and
that isn't pretty the problem with the
default path in life or your trajectory
that you are set on and conditioned into
since birth is compartmentalization
specialization and niching down we are
trained to focus on one dot instead of
the lines that connect the dots in
school we learn biology chemistry math
literature and more we go to individual
classes that don't connect the dots
between them all it lacks holism
creativity and the kind of practicality
that gets abnormal results after school
we narrow our minds further on what we
think we want to be for the rest of our
lives we're expected as teenagers to
choose one of infinite paths in life
when we haven't even started our real
life how can we know exactly what we
want there doesn't seem to be a greater
recipe for misery than to focus on one
thing for the rest of your life this
strips our curiosity and creativity from
us it leads to a world where Warriors
lack brains and intellectuals lack balls
a philosopher will ignore the Practical
aspects of Life simply because they
identify as a philosopher they are an
intellectual not a warrior but the main
question of philosophy is how does one
live the best life and so if a
philosopher can't build a business or
manage their emotions or create
fulfilling relationships then their
philosophy means absolutely nothing and
the same thing goes for something like
the reduction in approach to science
where you throw a frog in a blender and
You observe its parts but that lacks the
holistic nature of the frog that limits
the discoveries that can be made rather
than observing the frog in its
environment and how it moves even if you
put it in an environment that you create
that still there's no frogs interacting
with it it's not able to travel it's not
able to do its own thing and so
observing and studying and taking every
single piece taking the universe into
account and like a cone coming down from
the sky this is metaphorical analogous
where truth is this big picture narrowed
in on one small aspect of reality and
making discoveries that way like a
spotlight the effects of
compartmentalized learning destroy our
individual potential so now we need to
discuss the modern or the digital
renaissance man so here's a graphic
where the digital renaissance man is
self-educated they pursue their
curiosity they build digital leverage
they embark on physical training they
are health conscious they socialize they
dedicate time to purposeful work and
they are spiritually inclined because at
Birth we are prescribed a certain way of
life go to school get a job find a
partner try to squeeze in activities
that make life good retire at 65 and
never work again when work is a
necessary part of life that should
involve investing our attention what we
deem enjoyable in school we're told to
pick a major in business we're told to
pick a niche so we neglect the other
areas of study that make those things
work better and our results suffer
because of it creativity is the path to
wealth mental and financial and
creativity requires a high level of
understanding focused on a specific
problems like the cone we are smack in
the middle of a second Golden Age there
is so much information on the internet
that it becomes overwhelming there is no
way you can learn everything but you can
learn quite a bit people still live in a
paradigm where they have to get very
good at one thing because in the past
that's what the environment required for
Success now 6 success reserved for the
value Creator the specialized
generalists the New Renaissance Man the
digital Renaissance Man somebody who can
study diverse interests create value
from them and sustain an enjoyable
lifestyle like I teach in digital
economics so before we dive in I have an
announcement I am running one last
solopreneur Sprints before the year ends
and this may be the last one simply
because I'm building a new software
business and we're going to transfer the
Sprints over to that there's going to be
different topics so this is the last
time the Sprints on the one person
business model will actually be a thing
so if you're interested in creating your
niche of one building a name for
yourself and creating profitable career
and business opportunities writing about
your interests and hopefully discovering
your life's work I would encourage that
you at least check it out and enroll
before the closing date the link is in
the description solopreneur Sprints we
live in very interesting times where
there is an overabundance of information
but it's only overwhelming to those that
don't have goals and intentions behind
their learning because that's how you
learn learn everything is you filter
signal from noise in every single piece
of information that you process in
alignment with the conscious goals that
you set for yourself not the goals that
someone set for you because when you are
born people are just projecting goal
after goal after goal that shapes your
behavior and what you do and so you
perceive life through that lens and you
attempt to survive to achieve those
goals those goals are how you survive
and you interpret information and learn
in that fashion the Creator economy
emerged and it started condensing
information into actionable courses on
things like business health wealth
relationships Etc content courses and
books are like zip files for your mind
in the modern world it no longer takes
four to twelve years forty thousand
dollars and a piece of paper to make a
replaceable income but this implies
personal responsibility nobody is there
to hold your hand so here's what you do
the first thing is that you have to
become nobody become label-less become
everything be a designer writer marketer
socializer Runner bodybuilder
philosopher scientist psychologist and
polymath that knows how to sustain their
obsessive curiosity subscribing to one's
skill ideology or identity limits your
potential in every situation the
universe is a shape shifter it is in
constant flow the oceans evaporate
condense in the clouds rain down into
puddles and the water inevitably Finds
Its way back nothing is permanent your
cells are completely different from just
a few years ago your interests are
allowed to change your mind is allowed
to change you are allowed to change
become the universe Point number two is
the Curiosity Compass as a kid people
would discourage going through a phase
now I had my emo phase in high school I
had my bodybuilder phase I had my raver
phase and all of them have shaped who I
am today because evolution is about
transcending and including and so you
transcend and you pull the good parts up
with you where I have learned different
things throughout my life when I went
through those phases and was excessively
curious and experiencing life in those
domains whether it be the gym bro phase
the emo phase with different music and
even the raver phase and meeting people
meeting interesting people at Raves but
that's the thing is that there's
absolutely nothing wrong with
experimentation there is absolutely
something wrong with conforming to the
whims of others and this even goes for
something like going through a phase
where you just have to consistently
check in with yourself and make sure
that you are thinking independently and
not completely
relinquishing your autonomy just because
you want to fit in with that specific
group prescriptions road maps and long
curriculums are not bad but they narrow
your mind on a specific outcome with
specific advice to reach that goal this
is useful but should not be treated as a
one and done type of deal that's how you
get trapped in a miserable life there is
one pattern I've noticed in both myself
and those I aspire to be like they don't
limit what they learn to one thing
everything connects by pursuing what
you're curious about not only are you
motivated to learn but pattern
recognition increases meaningful
dopamine in the brain to help you
solidify high level knowledge focus on
one thing is good advice but only if
that one thing is a massive unrealistic
goal that requires you to focus on a
plethora of skills interests and
experiences to achieve that goal or at
least make it close to achieving that
goal it is wise to become obsessively
curious with a skill for one to two
months so that you can add it to your
toolbox and then when you move on to the
next one you do it from a place of
better experience and you're able to
notice more and you're able to acquire
skills faster and all of them combine
and culminate into this very unique
skill set that nobody else has because
you are pursuing curiosity and nobody
has the same Curiosities as you by
pursuing curiosity you are separating
yourself from the competition because
you are creating something truly unique
not only a skill set but what you are
able to produce in terms of like a
product or service for someone else so
that you can earn an income from it or
just when you communicate you don't want
to be the same as everyone else and so
the best way to do that is to diversify
through curiosity and even in business
when you Niche down for too long or too
far Niche down then you just become a
glorified search engine you lack depth
you lack depth and personality you lack
the thing that the future will require
people have explored the niche areas of
life enough right you you don't have to
subscribe to one little path like oh I'm
going to be a biologist I'm going to be
a chemist I'm going to be something else
you can become everything nowadays
simply because the learning is available
with courses content books Etc so
readily available information and your
ability to really do anything that you
want you can write content you can build
a readership it's it's all pointing to
the Creator economy and just
Distributing the value that you've
cultivated over time but most people
don't cultivate that value so the people
that do and can pursue their curiosity
for one to two months on end obsessively
for the thing that they discover through
experimentation because there's going to
be certain and things that don't
resonate with you but when you actually
do that then over the course of one two
years you launch ahead of 99 of people
and so that's the third Point here is
that you have to invest in your
education in this life you own one thing
your mind everything else can be taken
away from you there's one thing that the
school system did get right which is
consistent daily education and hopes for
a better future but schools don't
prioritize curiosity so most people hate
learning by the time they graduate
learning is the foundation of the human
experience and once you stop you die
hammer it into your head that you have
to be learning something anything every
single day no matter if it's 10 minutes
or three hours your future depends on it
it really does there is no other way to
discover a new potential for your life
so that you can actually move in a new
direction that wasn't assigned to you
because you can't act on opportunities
that don't exist to you and you can't
even register specific opportunities
because you have to get to a specific
level by pers doing your own thing
enough to actually be be able to note
that because you have the skill to do so
see if I haven't even started a business
I'm not going to be able to see someone
let's say on the internet and be like oh
this guy has this business I have this
offer he's going to be able to pay me
this much I'm going to reach out to him
in a way that I know how to do and then
eventually systemize that into a way
that consistently gets me those clients
you you don't know what to do because
you haven't started doing anything when
you stop learning your life stops
progressing you stop growing the
psychological benefits and feel good
chemicals stop flowing life gets
mediocre and repetitive you become
mechanical and robotic and so we've
talked about learning a lot through
curiosity education becoming nobody
doing everything but learning means
nothing without building so in my new
book The Art of focus which I am
launching a Keepsake Edition it keepsake
box this won't be a normal book launch
there is an updates Link in the
description if you want to join and get
updates on that but in the book I have a
section on the philosophy of the Builder
because one pattern I've noticed in my
life is that I've always carved out time
to build something of my own schoolwork
client work and projects assigned to me
at a job were necessary but didn't give
me the Fulfillment I was looking for my
life was The Meta project that was built
through a series of personal and
business projects projects frame your
attention and learning when your focus
is on that which you are building all
information that you were exposed to is
filtered through that lens as long as
you remain focused on the project the
source of learning is struggle not
memorization you must encounter a
problem discover the solution to that
problem and integrate it into your life
to identify a problem you need a goal to
solve a problem you need to create a
solution to create a solution you need a
project to invest your attention in for
the next one to six months this is what
I do every single morning this is what I
mean by I've always had a project to
build with my focused work and deep work
and four-hour workday philosophy the
first block of every single morning was
that high lever project that I was
building out that would lead me to the
life that I wanted and even when I was
working a nine to five I still had that
hour every single day that I was
building something I was making progress
no matter how slow it was and when I say
project I mean something that is
measurable and documented and it doesn't
have to be something like a physical
product where you're like you think of
project and you're like oh I need a
hammer I need Nails I need wood I need
to like arts and crafts that's not what
I mean it can be as simple as having
like a weight training log for going to
the gym and tracking your food tracking
your weight and researching and learning
about Fitness information along the way
so that you can correct your actions
along the way because you're not going
to be able to actually register a
problem when you are consuming the
education that you're trying to learn
because you weren't doing anything that
would make you realize you have that
problem it's just going to go in one ear
and out the other and so the same holds
true for business is when you are
building a product or when you're
building a brand you have the project
consists of levers that you're removing
every single day and it has Milestones
it has different things components of
the project that you have to piece
together so let's start there the first
thing you need is Big irrational goals
followed by small rational steps again
we have the cone shape that dictates
truth one Habit to build your mind one
Habit to build your body one Habit to
build your business experiment until you
can find the ones you can stick with for
life in five years you won't be the same
person big goals are better than small
goals because they give you the vision
motivation and long-term Focus necessary
to see them through because I get more
excited about wanting to build a million
dollar business in one year instead of
sending 10 networking emails a day I get
more excited looking shredded on the
beach this summer than I do meal
prepping for the week or having the
weekly goal of meal prepping so to
embark on the Journey of becoming
multi-dimensionally jacked you need to
create a big goal for each pillar of
your life the first is mind how do you
want to handle emotions and stress do
you want to have the same mediocre
mindset as everyone else second is body
how do you want to look and feel how
does that impact other areas of your
life like how others perceive you and
throw opportunities at you the third is
Spirit do you feel like life lacks
meaning wonder and fulfillment do you
feel like life is happening to you or
that you are flowing with life the
fourth is business how much money do you
want to make why do you want that money
to come from a purposeful Endeavor
unlike ninety percent of jobs and the
problem is that most people stop here
they mentally masturbate over their
goals and they tell people about it
which is scientifically shown to
increase dopamine levels in the brain as
if you achieve that goal and you end up
never making any meaningful progress
towards them so the second step is to
outline a project for each domain of
Life the goal is the what the vision is
the why and the project is the how now
that we have a vision and motivation for
our goals we need to gain Clarity
projects have a goal process and
priority actions to knock out on a daily
basis so what can you do every single
day that will move the needle towards
your goals what ask specs of your goals
do you need to educate yourself on to
make better decisions how can you
document your progress in a way that
keeps you motivated to come back
tomorrow so in a notebook where
hopefully you wrote down your goals I
hope you're not just watching this and
learning without building I want you to
create a simple project for each goal so
first thing you write down is the
Milestone so write down tangible
Milestones with realistic timelines the
second is variables write out each
variable that will help you achieve the
goal for health it's nutrition training
sleep for business it's product traffic
generation content etc etc you can
figure that out the third is principles
the priority actions that will move the
needle forward and the fourth is the
skills the skills you have to acquire to
actualize that goal this brings even
more clarity to changing your life now
the third thing we need to understand is
that you want to start then learn if you
want to learn faster don't start
learning first outline a project second
start building it out third learn along
the way too many people get trapped in
tutorial hell stacking up use less
knowledge as brain fog start encounter a
problem and experiment with different
techniques to solve that problem and
when I was learning Photoshop I would
try to learn everything before even
using the software and when I did start
using the software it was starting over
from scratch I didn't know anything I
had to supplement with specific
tutorials and videos that were like
create with me or here's me building out
a piece in Photoshop and I had to figure
out just what to do along the way where
if I had a problem and I watch a video
then I that problem is in my head and
I'm going to see what the other person
is doing and I'm going to remember that
much much more and I'm going to be able
to go back to my project and fix it and
this is why you need that constant
balance of learning building learning
building learning building you can't
have one without the other you can't
have output without input so as you can
tell I would highly recommend a general
education habit literally just 10 to 30
minutes a day of listening to a YouTube
video that interests you or a podcast or
Reading part of a book or reading like a
short form summary like with the app
short form or really anything like that
just learn something the last and fourth
thing that we have to touch on here is
lifestyle design through habit formation
build your mind with books
self-reflection and writing build your
body with the gym long walks and
nutrient dense foods build your business
with skill acquisition problem solving
and self-promotion becoming
multi-dimensionally jacked is the path
to the good life the difference between
you and who you want to become are the
habits that compose your lifestyle think
about it do mentally physically or
financially Jack people just wake up
with the best mind body and business one
day or do they have tiny actions they
take on a daily basis that maintains
their progress and builds towards a
better future and most people will tell
you to stop playing video games to stop
going out and to stop distracting
yourself and I agree but I don't I still
play video games here and there maybe
like four to five hours a week if that
maybe like two to five it varies right
it's not habitual and I still go out
with friends and stay up late but that's
like every two to four weeks it really
just depends hence I have other things
to do I have my priorities straight and
so when the time comes up I can actually
think critically about that and make a
good decision and so the reason I
outpaced 95 percent of people is that I
front load my mornings with needle
moving tasks between 5 AM and 11 am I go
on a run three to four days a week
otherwise I go on a walk the other days
to maintain that habit of going outside
I write my newsletter and content for
one hour this sustains 95 of my business
remember principles I build out a new
project right now it's my book launch
and software company I hit the gym six
to seven days a week I take walks in
between all of those activities I cook
nutrient dense meals that take 10 to 15
minutes to prepare and eat out for
dinner quite a bit I'm hovering around 4
500 calories a day this is a picture of
me right now just to
throw post physique show proof that I'm
not just like hiding in an oversized tea
right now and I understand that not
everyone can do this because of time
constraints but there is something you
can do there's some part of your life
that you can change and once you stop
believing that you're [ __ ] and you may
not be able to do it right now but you
can do what you can right now so that
you can do what you want in the future
and as you get results from your efforts
you become more efficient at what you do
time will free up since that should be a
sub goal for almost every goal you set
it's a great way of measuring progress
when in doubt waking up an hour earlier
unlocks the distraction free time that
will solve most of your problems that's
it for this video my friends I
appreciate you watching the art of focus
coming soon check the links in the
description for solopreneur Sprints that
is starting on September 12th enrollment

business and productize yourself and
