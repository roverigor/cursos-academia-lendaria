if you're anything like me you love
studying deep Concepts but there's a
dissonance you feel like you could never
be as deep as your favorite authors
speakers or even just the people you
follow on social media as an 18 year old
that just got arrested for smoking pot
in the college parking garage I gave the
book The Power of Now a try I read the
book very closely I practiced the
meditations and I opened my mind to the
possibility of a higher power that I had
closed my mind off to when I was a
rebellious young teen who was being
forced to go to church that book The
Power of Now changed everything for me
it eased my worries about getting a
potential felony charge when I got
arrested and it helped me calm down and
be a lot less reactive towards the
things I didn't agree with as a teenager
I didn't remember everything from that
book but I remembered 10 times more than
I did from other books that I was either
told to read or was just reading because
I felt like reading I retained a lot
more knowledge so that's what we're here
to talk about is why I retained so much
more knowledge and now I know that in my
videos I usually drag on the intro quite
a bit so with this one I want to start
with some actionable advice that you can
take but the deeper stuff we need to
build up to it so that you can
understand it so let's dive into some
takeaways from the start but if you want
like the depth and something that you
can practice in your everyday life stick
around for the rest of the video so why
did I remember so much from that book
from my self-reflection I came up with
three steps the first one was having an
intention I'm very big on goal setting
whether you are aware of that goal or
not or whether you keep it at the top of
mind or not you need something to aim
towards and when I read the book it was
the perfect fit for my situation in life
I was at arguably one of the lowest
points in my life I mean imagine getting
arrested tested as an 18 year old going
home for college getting a letter in the
mail saying that you have you either
have to go to court and possibly be
convicted of a felony or you pay like
ten thousand dollars and have to get
tested every single week for drugs and
just pee in a cup every week at a random
time and so clearly this freaked me out
I didn't have any money to my name I was
the stereotypical broke college student
who was working a summer job just to be
able to have some money to pay for
college and the things I was doing
during that time for when I went back to
college the next year and there was just
no way in hell that I was going to tell
my parents about what happened so trying
to keep that a secret just stress me out
even more and so when The Power of Now
the book was recommended to me I had the
intent I was in that perfect place in
life where the teaching stood out to me
where I had something practical to try
and overcome the challenges that I was
facing mentally so this led led to me
reading that book which I have heard
from many people that have talked to me
after I recommend that book where they
say it's maybe too woo-woo or too
spiritual or they just didn't understand
it and the reason why is because they're
not in the situation in life where the
teachings will register in their
awareness in order for them to actually
change their behavior to get the desired
outcome that they want to get that was
the first thing is having an intention
the second thing is genuine curiosity I
first heard about the book The Power of
Now from Matt ogus and
um if you guys were around like a decade
ago on YouTube and were into fitness
there were a few select like OG Fitness
YouTubers uh Matt ogis was one of them
and he was just someone that I
continuously watched right he got me in
the gym uh I just loved his personality
he was someone that I aspired to be like
and I trusted him and so he had
recommended that book many times but I
had yet to uh like dive into the whole
spirituality thing and so when I finally
decided to pick it up I was genuinely
curious to go through the book and
figure out what this whole spirituality
thing that people are talking about is
and so genuine curiosity in this case
with having an intention made me read
that much more close I wanted to
understand it right I wasn't looking to
close my mind off and pick apart little
things that I don't agree with in the
book I wanted to understand what was
going on there even though my mind did
react like when he talked about God in
the actual book I'm like oh God doesn't
exist and but then I had to step back
and be like okay but
does
does he actually or does the notion of
God is there something that I'm missing
here that
I wouldn't otherwise discover
if I just wrote the notion of God off
entirely so the third thing is reducing
the execution Gap the greatest skill one
can develop is decreasing the time
between idea and execution that is a
tweet that I wrote that just popped off
randomly uh it was very apparent at my
point in life as many of my tweets are
some people disagreed with it like oh
there's different skills that are the
greatest skill and it's like yeah I
understand but in my situation in life
that was the greatest skill so when I
read the book and I came across
something I could practice I didn't keep
reading right I stopped I put down the
book and I practiced whether it be when
I was outside drinking my coffee I read
it and it gave advice about meditation I
would stop right there and meditate and
so since the ideas and everything else
had aligned to the point where I would
notice whether or not the practices were
working right since all of that was at
the top of my mind and I hadn't forgot
any of it I hadn't forgot any of the
nuances that would make me glance over
the outcome that I was trying to achieve
it was that much easier to solidify that
knowledge and practice in my head
because I had backed it with direct
experience that is an important point I
backed the theory with direct experience
so having an intention genuine curiosity
and reducing the execution Gap is a
great way to retain a lot of what you
learn but we can do better than that
over the years here's what what I've
discovered to 10x what I learned and
retain much of what I learned so much so
that as an example I can articulate
things in the form of a YouTube video
here the modern problem is abundance of
information we love to hoard Theory
Orthodoxy and conceptual understanding
of things without the direct experience
to back them life doesn't work that way
and we all know those guys in either the
Instagram comments or just the comments
somewhere where they'll just write like
a book's worth of information let's say
on like Fitness but then you go and you
look at their profile and it doesn't
look like they've ever stepped within 10
feet of a barbell and it's the same with
business it's like you'll see someone
give a book a business advice but then
you actually look at their business and
it doesn't look like they've been within
a 10 foot radius of a customer and what
you'll find in most domains is that the
true experts rarely need guidance they
use the science theory advice and then
backed it with action to get to the
intermediate stage but then after that
in the expert stage it's usually based
off of intuition because you have such a
solid understanding of the entire domain
that you know what to do next so the
main question here is how do we balance
practice with Theory and that is by
becoming a builder always having
something to build or always having a
project in alignment with the thing that
you are learning so when I was first
learning Photoshop as an example I would
just watch YouTube videos all the time I
didn't practice Photoshop I didn't even
have the app downloaded and that of
course led to Nowhere when I downloaded
the app and tried to test my knowledge
by creating some form of design I wasn't
able to create anything I had to
supplement with learning anyways and so
once I realized this and understood how
much knowledge I actually retained by
having a project to build out first or
having an intention and then
supplementing that with either specific
tutorials or just trying to find the
specific knowledge that I needed
when I encountered a problem or when I
didn't know how to do something that's
when it locked into my brain and so
going on to that when I started web
design and I wanted to build a website I
knew that I just had to just I had to
start fooling around with the software
and trying to build something and then
when I didn't know how to do something
like create a specific navigation design
then I go and look that up specifically
and then work through it with the
tutorial and then I could almost
replicate that every single time after
with any other website I created now why
does this method of always having
something to build work so well when it
comes to retaining knowledge so the
first thing is forced synchronicity
because novelty pattern recognition and
dopamine are crucial for learning that's
how you kind of get into learning when
you make that Discovery dopamine
excitement from noticing patterns or
noticing how you can use one thing in
another area that's when your brain is
kind of just ready to understand that
and as an example when our ancestors
learn something new the especially when
it aligned with their survival that's
when it kind of became very apparent to
them that they had to retain that
knowledge so when one of our ancestors
or someone in the old times would go by
a bush over and over again right it was
conditioned into their brain that the
bush didn't really Aid in their survival
there was no fruit there was no berries
whatever it may be it was just a bush
but when they noticed something new like
berries growing on the bush that caught
their attention and they were much more
likely to remember that the next time
come around if they needed it for their
survival because now it had berries but
if they didn't have anything to use
those berries for like if they weren't
berries and it was just a new Leaf then
they wouldn't remember it because they
didn't have anything to apply it to and
so in that case they were using the
berries for their physical survival but
when you have a project and I've talked
about this a few other times but a lot
of what we're trying to do in this
Modern Age with information and ideas is
we're trying to survive
the notion or the concept of self right
what we think we are the idea of what we
are and that causes a lot of pain and
suffering but in this case when you have
a project that is Meaningful you will
notice things in order to survive that
project because you want that project to
progress and develop and live and so
when that's in your awareness or when
you know that something's there you're
going to notice things that align with
that and that you can apply to that
project in order for it to grow so that
was for synchronicity but the second
thing is the law of inspired action I
only write when inspiration strikes
fortunately it strikes at nine every
morning William Faulkner everyone knows
that they can act better when they are
inspired like if you're going to go
train Chess at the gym you may watch a
chest motivation video before you go or
just a chest workout so you can get
motivation for exercise and form that
you can do while you're there so it's at
the top of your mind and before I write
I love reading authors and just ideas
and writing that inspires me and gives
me ideas and so with a project you are
enticed to learn in accordance with it
because it will inspire you to keep that
project going and so referring to the
quote I just read from William Faulkner
if you have something that you can
consume that will help with your project
before you even work on the project or
have some way of working that into your
routine you can see my video on my fill
empty use framework for productivity and
creativity to bake into your daily
routine that's only going to help and
it's going to keep the momentum going
with that project's growth so as another
example if you are 100 committed to
building a business you are going to
naturally gravitate if you aren't
distracted all of this is with the
preface that you aren't distracted and
you are actively eliminating
distractions but if you're committed to
building a business you're going to
naturally gravitate towards consuming
the information that will help you build
that business but you have to start
build building the damn business in
order to apply those teachings now the
third thing is specific knowledge which
we've already touched on a bit if you've
been watching my videos for a while you
know I am a big fan of the advice start
then learn when you start something even
if you don't know what you're doing
you're going to encounter problems these
problems will induce struggle and prime
your brain to learn so you won't be
learning blindly or without context or
from somebody that isn't teaching you
exactly what you're trying to do because
when you learn blindly you gain a bunch
of information fat it's like in
bodybuilding when you do a dirty bulk
versus a lean bulk in a dirty bulk
you're going to gain a lot more fat than
you will muscle and in a lean bulk
you're trying to optimize for those lean
muscle gains but you're of course going
to pick up some extra body fat along the
way and so if you dirty bulk too hard or
you learn so much that your thoughts are
just scattered you're going to feel slow
sluggish tired until you get to the
point where you just feel so bad that
you're going to have to go into a
cutting phase you're going to have to
ruthlessly eliminate a lot of the things
that you learned because they have no
practical application in your life so
start building something and then ask
questions or seek specific advice in the
form of advice or tutorials online when
the problem comes up because anything
other than that from what I've seen
asking vague questions like should I
start is just procrastination from
starting if you don't know what the
result is going to be after you start
the only way you're going to know what
it is is not from someone else it's
going to happen from you directly
experiencing that result you get from
starting if you want to learn faster
don't start learning outline a project
start building it out learn along the
way too many people get trapped in
tutorial Health stacking up useless
knowledge as brain fog start encounter a
problem seek specific knowledge to
overcome it that is a tweet I wrote and
I think it's a pretty good summary if
you just want to refer to that to kind
of remember
what we just talked about so let's take
this up a notch because building helps
you retain quite a bit of knowledge but
teaching helps you retain even more
teaching is another modality where you
can solidify that knowledge even further
in your brain so why don't we combine
the two to create a life of novelty
synchronicity and Serendipity just to
increase not only the amount of
knowledge that we retain but the
enjoyment that we have for Life as a
whole by creating a lifestyle that is
conducive to us learning the things that
we want to learn which is what we talk
about in a lot of these videos just
under a different context and so how do
we do this we do this by turning you
into the project because building a
project doesn't only apply to something
external doesn't only apply to like a
Photoshop project if you treat your
entire life as a project that you build
and grow and cut down and rebuild and
just have fun with along the way then
life becomes that much better because
everything that you learn can be applied
to your life and so this implies
holistic development because personal
development doesn't only come from
improving yourself it comes from the
impact that you make on the world AKA
what you teach other people in other
words your business or for those that
don't resonate with the term business or
think that they can't start a business
or think that they aren't ready you can
exchange the word business for your
life's work or your calling or just
however you plan to leave the world
better than you left it so it's the
polarity between selfishness and
selflessness improving yourself and then
helping others improve it's like
climbing a mountain but carving out a
trail along the way that other people
can follow or documenting your journey
so others can achieve it faster and if
enough people do this imagine what we
can achieve right because people are
getting to higher levels of
consciousness and just personal growth
and professional growth much much faster
this is why I'm a huge proponent of the
Creator economy and creating your own
product or service that helps other
people get to where you're at faster
because then everyone is going that's
how you raise the collective
Consciousness is by helping people
develop themselves Faster by kind of
finding out what the real shortcuts are
by promoting a holistic understanding of
things and then what comes next right we
don't know because we're going to
hopefully raise a group of people to be
these top performers and then they're
going to have the creative uh ideas to
take us into that next phase of life or
business or all of the sub domains under
those things and this is what business
is to me at least and I feel like a lot
of people mistake business as just some
Mega corporation that just hates
everyone and isn't really conducive to
society as a whole so let's tie
everything that we've learned here into
six steps for how you can retain the
most knowledge possible so the first
thing is set in intention and that means
set a goal create a purpose have a why
behind your actions or however you want
to frame it make an intention to improve
your life or to actualize your potential
this has to be held at the top of your
awareness if you want to apply the
things that you consume to
how you can improve any facet of your
life so this sets your focus on the
future and it allows you to channel
everything that you experience into that
Vision it allows you to see the side or
view the things that you view from the
lens of your vision therefore you're
only going to see them in that positive
light of course you can see them in a
negative light and this is a lifelong
process but you get what I'm saying here
everything you consume starts to fuel
your vision if that vision is genuinely
important and you are dedicated to
achieving that so step number two is to
schedule a creativity block because
everyone and their mother knows that
scheduling time for productivity or deep
work is important but what people don't
understand is that productivity and
creativity are on two sides of the same
coin you have to have creative things to
implement through productivity because
if you're a creative and you're just
trapped in this Loop of like narrow
Focus hyper productivity
what are you doing like are you hunting
for ideas outside of your productive
work blocks or are you creating on an
empty tank do you value the spontaneous
nature of creativity and do you have a
balance between that or are you a slave
to regimented work and productivity apps
so my favorite way to do this and you
can test and experiment for yourself on
what works best for you but my favorite
way to do this is to just schedule a
30-minute walk and on this walk you can
listen to an audiobook or podcast
related to your intention contemplate
your future and let your mind work
through problems get yourself away from
the distractions that would keep you in
a non-creative state and so if you don't
know what the default mode network is in
Psychology I would highly recommend you
learn that but it comes from shifting
your focus from external to internal and
that's what kind of kicks on uh the
thing in your brain that allows you to
be more creative it kind of opens and
expands your mind to the point of having
ideas
uh register in your conscious mind so
that you can actually have access to
them and write them down and then use
them in your productive work sessions
and an example that I always use for
this is like when a programmer
encounters a bug when they're writing
code right they encounter a problem so
when you're building out a project and
you encounter a problem and you just
can't figure out how to do it then you
need to take a break and go on a walk or
just rest and do nothing or go to the
gym or something that isn't focused on
work and then like magic like when
you're in the shower and have a shower
thought the idea or the solution comes
to your mind and then you need to write
it down and go back and implement it
into your code or into your project and
so this is also important because a lot
of people are living in a state of just
narrow focus and that is when uh stress
becomes a thing is when you're narrowly
focused on a thing that causes stress
and so just having these things baked
into your routine where you are
encouraged to open your mind and get
into the state of open focus and
de-stress is just going to be helpful
all around not only for like creativity
and work reasons so step number three is
to create a note-taking system so I
could write an entire book on this on
taking notes I'm actually creating a
software right now for creators to have
a better way of taking notes for their
Creations it's like steel like an artist
but in software form but I also have a
free seven day challenge uh creative
challenge that has my current
note-taking system in it where you can
download that link in the description
it's free it has a full course inside of
it
um that really changed my life and I
feel like it will help quite a bit with
your creative Endeavors and so the
purpose of creating a note-taking system
is because as you're going about this
with the intention of you improving your
life as a project and even having
creative projects or work projects to
build out you having those intentions
you're when you're away from those
projects and not working on them and
you're in that state of creativity and
the ideas are popping into your head
head you need a place to write them down
and possibly develop those ideas further
so that your work in building out your
projects whether it's your life or your
business
it will fuel it that much better and the
best way I can explain this example of
like when you're out and about is when
you notice a new car for the first time
one that you've never seen before and
then you're going down the road and you
start to see them everywhere so my
editor for example when the Jeep
Gladiator came out uh we both looked at
it and we thought it was like the
stupidest looking car and so now we're
plagued with that and every time we see
a Jeep Gladiator Devin the editor he
always goes hey a deep Gladiator and I
swear to God he said that like 200 times
by now Devin you really need to stop
saying that but at the same time it
helps paint a picture of what we're
talking about here and so imagine if you
were in love with the idea of building
out the project of Your Mind Body Spirit
and business you would start to see
opportunity everywhere and if you don't
have that intention all of those
opportunities are just slipping right
under your nose so step number four is
to build every aspect of your life you
you aren't seeing progress because
you're obsessed with the polished end
result not the process that created it
you have to understand here that you are
building
building right how long does it take to
build a mansion especially building a
mansion by yourself right building a
mansion may take like a year or two with
a construction team but you don't have a
construction team you're only you
building a mansion is going to take your
entire lifetime and that's exactly the
point here is to fall in love with
infinite games not finite status games
so I've said this many times before but
really if you're just starting out you
have to try out everything and see what
genuinely interests you and then when
you catch that whiff of excitement or
dopamine that tries to pull you down the
rabbit hole of Discovery then don't deny
that you have to go into it and see if
you get obsessed with it and then once
you find that thing you continue
repeating that process for life you get
obsessed with one thing and that expands
your awareness to in that domain and
then you notice another thing that you
would have never normally noticed
because you haven't tried or committed
to anything and then you commit to that
you go further down the rabbit hole and
this is just how you compound knowledge
over time is by trying things diving
deep on one living in that area or
experiencing life from that state of
heightened knowledge and then branching
off into something else going down that
branch and then another branch and then
another branch and then coming back and
like seeing the whole picture and just
that's it if you don't make time to
build your assigned time to build for
someone else so step five is to teach
what you know now we've talked about
learning building uh teaching this
entire time so here's a graphic as we
always do I like this one it's very
simple but you can see on the outlines
of the circles that white line or that
white part of the circle represents how
much you can learn doing that thing so
when you start you're going to learn so
much more than just learning alone right
and then when you start building you're
going to learn even more because you
have something to apply what you are
learning too and you can encounter
problems and speak seek specific
knowledge and then when you teach it
just solidifies it that much better and
you're forced to articulate your
understanding of it right and then you
can identify where you have knowledge
gaps and what you're trying to teach
because you're it's going to suck at
first right my first YouTube video
sucked all of my teaching sucked but I
identified what sucked about it and then
I was able to fill in those blanks come
back to it and start reteaching it from
better place and so this whole teaching
thing it's known as the Protege effect
in short that means learning by teaching
and so clearly as I keep talking about
here uh like if you're subscribed to
this channel I'm sure you're interested
in the whole one-person business model
and like a personal branding or the
Creator economy because it's so new but
I feel like it's new for a reason right
we've Advanced to this point in society
as to where everyone and their mother
can have their own business right as a
Creator as we are as people we are
creators and so as a Creator what do you
do right you build build a brand and you
can learn the skills to solve the
problems in your brand so you can
actually grow it and then usually in my
case and what I promote is being a value
Creator so your job is to educate and
entertain better than the schools can
because they can't keep up with what's
going on they can't cover every aspect
of reality like everyone that is
researching their own unique interests
can't and so when you teach about those
things and you synthesize what you're
learning into an articulate uh piece of
educational material or content then
like it's just the best way to learn
I've only come to experience this
because I've done it but I recommend
other people do it so they can find this
out but the best way to retain what you
learn in relation to the things you love
learning about is to one improve
yourself in public with a personal brand
learn the skills necessary to build that
so you remember those skills and then
you can teach about those skills or just
your interests so you retain a lot of
that knowledge and slowly and slowly
over time with a personal brand it's
Dynamic right you're not limited to one
specific Niche because it's under your
name and so you can dive into all of
these different domains as long as
you're making your interest interesting
to other people and then you can grow
you can build an audience and then
eventually you can create a product to
monetize and by this point if you stick
it out long enough and actually do what
I'm telling you to do here then like
that's how you make a living for
yourself so the last step step number
six is to turn this into your life's
work the amount of serendipity that will
occur in your life your luck surface
area is directly proportional to the
degree to which you do something you're
passionate about combined with the total
number of people to who this is
effectively communicated Jason Roberts
that is a great quote work is a
necessary part of life and for most work
consumes a majority of their waking
hours and for many this work lacks
interest in fashion and so if it lacks
interest and passion and work consumes a
large amount of your waking hours then a
large amount of your waking hours are
spent doing something that you have no
interest or passion in and is this
something that you want right because uh
with time and because of polarity right
there there's work and there's rest one
doesn't exist without the other if you
go too much rest or you only think that
you want to rest the entire life your
entire life you're you're not going to
like it because there's no
there's no balance there there's no wave
the rest loses meaning if work ceases to
exist and if rest ceases to exist then
work lacks meaning and so
I personally maybe my views on this will
change but I don't ever plan on retiring
because even if I do retire per se I'm
still probably gonna work on something
right I'm still gonna build something
and so since work and rest are a must in
every single person's life do you want
the work aspect to be something that you
lack interest or enjoyment in if not
here's what I would do research what you
feel pulled to research don't get
distracted let it pull you deep into a
rabbit hole of Discovery understand that
sustained curiosity plus excitement
equals passion practice sustaining that
passion with everything we've talked
about here note down your findings build
a project and begin teaching others and
so since I do talk about this a lot
under the lens of the one person
business or being a value Creator what
many people don't realize is that
products start off as projects so if you
are the project and you put that project
on the public market social media you
become a product that other people want
to invest in with not only their money
but their attention projectize yourself
then productize yourself now you have to
understand that you don't launch a
product when it's perfect that's
impossible entrepreneurs or just
business people in general they launch
MVPs or minimum viable products what
that is is it's a project that delivers
enough value to charge for launch and
build or improve over time so to
summarize everything you are your life's
work your minimum viable product was
created at Birth start build teach and
