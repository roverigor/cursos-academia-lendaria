what's up man Mr danco how are we doing
I'm good man dude I'm excited for this
um
I guess
framing this is we're here in Scottsdale
I've been here since Thursday Sunday now
and wanted to get this conversation on
the books wouldn't we plan this Monday
something like that pretty pretty short
it was very short quick turnaround yeah
because you didn't even come out here
for this it was more so like you had
something planned the idea came to mind
we executed and here we are yeah yeah
I knew that
I was only going to be here for a
certain amount of time and
getting this was a priority because so
why are we here
we've known each other now for two years
a little over two years probably some
time in 2020. and a lot has happened
during that time
and I think
catching up like we haven't sat down and
said damn what's really happened over
the last couple years where are we at
now how do we get here and I think it'd
just be fun to
go over all that Life Fitness business
pretty much everything we got going on
yeah I like how you framed it
um
earlier where this is what we would have
wanted when we were just starting out is
like long unfiltered unedited for the
people that
um
like that kind of stuff like I I
personally enjoy very long form content
like a lot of the time when I'm not
looking specifically for like a strategy
or something else it's more so to gain
perspective so that I can approach a
strategy or like generate ideas or
set a new goal or just gain Clarity on
what it is because throughout this
entire three hours there might be one
thing that one person picks up that
changes the entire course of their life
even if that thing is insignificant to
us right now
and I liked how
you we we talked briefly before we
started about how
like we I personally I don't know if
it's an aspiration for you I want to
hear about that but it was an aspiration
for me to become
uh not necessarily a YouTuber but like
the people that I looked up to that I
aspired to be like when I was a kid and
at that time it was like Fitness
YouTubers that I was watching it was
and then that branched into like
podcasts I was listening to and that
really opened me up to like what is
becoming possible with this entire space
and where things are moving in terms of
not only like the Creator economy but
just what's possible for the individual
to achieve and
what's even more possible once they find
people with those shared goals shared
purpose shared perspective to kind of
10x the power of what it is that we're
building and this is already sparking a
lot of ideas so we can break this down
subtly but I think for context we are
the same age 27 26 when do you turn 27.
October 22nd Okay cool so I just turned
27 last Saturday we have very similar
Inspirations like you said Fitness
YouTubers I think we started we have
interesting similarities in our fitness
Journeys business Journeys all that and
so that I think we look up to very
similar people and have similar
Inspirations and like you said
those people that we look up to
whenever I was exploring or listening to
them I loved these long-form
conversations especially
when two of them would get together that
didn't really interact that much right
because you got to see them a lot of
times they would operate in their own
lane and then getting seeing them
together and letting their ideas mix and
we're fortunate now it's still kind of
interesting and funny to say but like
we've become those people for a lot of
individuals on Twitter Instagram YouTube
all that and getting
our ideas back and forth I think is
going to be fun uh who knows how long
we'll go today I think three four hours
we'll see I got plenty of caffeine so
yeah same no it's uh I wanna know who
your like first Inspirations what are
the ones that actually stick out in your
head
um because for me the the first people
was like the the Golden Era of Fitness
YouTube where it was like
um Matt ogus
Chris Lovato or yucky Lovato and they
had like Legends of Aesthetics they
started their clothing brand that was
when Jim shark was just starting up I
don't know what happened to them
recently but uh it was them Joe Delaney
and my favorite
things were when they got together like
this and then they either did q and A's
or it was just the the unfiltered like
back and forth questioning so like one
of my favorite videos
um
in well it was from this guy Abdul azina
if you've never checked him out dude
he's severely underrated but
it's because he's like just dropping
strike heat and he doesn't care or give
a to like cater to the algorithm
he's this insane endurance bike rider he
started out with like Olympic lifting
and then he met up with like Matt ogus
yucky Lovato he became like friends with
them that's how I was introduced to him
and
like he's done just insane and he
just comes with these philosophical
lessons from it from endurance racing
and
I could go into like weird stories that
I've heard from him but he was like
writing one time
he just didn't want to stop he was
writing for hours straight like staying
at hotels getting straight back on the
bike he was literally his pants
on the bike because he did not want to
stop like he was just deep in the
trenches and that's what he talks about
I don't know it's those type of videos
where you wouldn't expect
to pull an Insight from it because I'm
not an endurance bike rider but at the
same time it's like holy like this
guy can go 40 hours riding as hard as he
can
while putting himself through the ringer
living homeless like nothing to his name
scraping by and still just doing that's
what he likes to do it's like he's found
joy in
it's like David Goggins but I think it's
more extreme like he does I don't think
he he probably has a home now but during
the time he was like homeless he was
riding across the country
Scavenging food here and there for an
endurance bike race which is insane and
all those different things so I hope
that we can drop some insights and
what's so cool about that is
you've developed a relationship with him
and watched so much of his content and
same with those guys Matt ogus like that
Golden Era of what that was probably
2014 2015 like early early YouTube those
videos are seven eight years old and
you have developed a relationship with
those people just by them documenting
their influence my entire journey and
I'm not even in the fitness space me too
me too and I think Fitness is definitely
a and that could be just where we start
with some of this but it is a funnel
into everything else I think because you
take ownership of your Fitness
and your overall health and it's
a gateway drug to business to taking
just full ownership of everything
but why don't we start with when because
I know what we can spend a lot of time
on that because I think our fitness
Journeys are are very similar in terms
of how we got to where we were but we
met
when
ish it was like mid 2020 I think I shot
you a DM after listening to you on Danny
Miranda's podcast right we've both been
guests at that point and Danny's up to
like couple hundred episodes at this
point and we were pretty early on there
and this was at the time we probably had
what
10 000 Twitter followers 15 000 Twitter
followers something like that still
trying to figure that all out like maybe
it was probably I think it was a bit
higher okay it was like I think I was at
like 50 you were at like 100k really
yeah oh because you were flying at that
point like I was just like sitting back
watching like about the writing but
that's what was interesting to me is
that you realize
um like the shared interest where it's
like at the time it's like I only think
you are interested in writing because
that's your Niche and then you may only
think that I was interested in something
else but then you get on a podcast you
get introduced to like what these people
are interested in it's like oh like you
like this thing or or you're on this
fitness journey I resonated with it a
lot let's connect and now here we are
we're here that's a good point because
I think you can on Twitter especially
you can talk about a very specific thing
and become known for that thing but and
I think that's a pretty good strategy
in the beginning of just talking about
what you're learning what you're
interested in all that but then you get
on these kind of conversations and you
hear someone talk about everything
they're interested in and that's how you
know you're aligned with them right
because I've been in a
finding people like you that see the
world similarly to me has always been a
challenge throughout my whole life right
I talked about this on Danny's podcast
but like growing up
I was extremely obsessive with
everything I did like Rubik's Cube
dude and did you do uh stack cups or
whatever I never got into stack ups but
I wanted to fifth grade I was a
professional speed keeper like 18
seconds going to tournaments and
everyone I mean like I was not cool at
all but I mean video games
all of that was always I would start
later than other people
my friends would start something and I'd
still be on the old thing and then I'd
be like oh that looks interesting let me
go do that and then I would pick it up
quickly become fully obsessed with it
and then have to go find new people to
do that play that game with yeah and
that has repeated many times over in my
life and I think it's happening right
now
um
in what sense well with like meeting you
right when you first start
playing the Twitter game or playing any
social media game you're kind of just
figuring it out on your own and then as
you progress you continually have to
find people that are interested in
continuing to take it to another level
right I always struggled with that in
school because
you didn't have the power of the
internet it was like if you surpassed
your friends you just were kind of stuck
like there was a reason that I was doing
all those things on my own you kind of
isolate you make yourself lonely though
and the internet has completely
democratized the ability to find other
people that are interested and
all it taught me was that Obsession was
not a bug in my personality it was a
feature right where instead of I picked
this thing up I got good at it and then
there was like not resentment but you
just that self-induced loneliness of no
one else is doing this like I am does
that mean I'm doing something wrong and
I think
parents not my parents but other parents
Society in general discourages that kind
of
Obsession and intensity that you can
bring to things
and that's why I'm so passionate about
people putting their ideas out on the
internet because you become able to find
the other people where you realize you
are not alone in that right yeah dude
the I feel like one thing that
always freaks people out to an extent
and it's very difficult to understand
without actually doing it and without
experience like the the one thing I love
actionable advice everyone does but at
the same time it's like it's
prescriptive it's not going to teach you
the nuances that experience will teach
you it's not going to make things click
for you and one of those things is just
putting out your ideas where
if and especially
people have trouble breaking out of
their Niche or like something that they
not not forever but something that they
like when they're talking about their
expertise and money's on the line
they're doing it for lead generation
they need to build a business whatever
it may be and they're freaked out that
making one tweet out of 40 000 over
their entire lifetime on something like
their Fitness progress is going to ruin
their account and so they keep it they
suppress it but
it's so interesting what kind of people
can find and spread that message where
um Justin Scott
said like the internet is the great
attractor and after like so much time in
the game like I we have such diverse
audiences that
it's easy or not easy but
it's crazy how many people have those
nuanced interests that you think are
weird but you won't know if someone else
likes them unless you put the idea out
if that makes sense so it's like I like
to think of it as whenever you tweet
you're kind of putting it out into a
void like you can assume what kind of
Engagement or like who's gonna read it
but it could end up on the entire
different side of the internet just
because someone found it interesting
where it's like I posted content and I
have people like John Cena following me
out of nowhere right or these DJs that
I've been seeing for years or even yucky
Lovato like Chris Lovato dm'd me one
time just out of nowhere he was like
dude I love your content and I was like
no way like you're in my DMs
right now dude and we talked for a good
amount of time yeah and it was insane
it's like how you can attract these
people simply by
putting your ideas out on the internet
kind of into the void and letting them
circulate get better with time and
attract the right people which I don't
mean to drag on here but it's such a
different like I really see the internet
marketing space shifting quite a bit
because before it was like okay you need
to learn how to
find this perfect Target do this
customer Avatar market research figure
out where they are send a hyper tactical
message and now it's so much more broad
it's the opposite end of the spectrum
where I can put out like
I don't necessarily recommend only
putting out simple platitude tweets but
I could put out some just random tweet
and that could lead to a client that
could lead to a friend that could lead
to me traveling across the country you
don't really know
unless you stick it out for some round
of time and like Trust
that's something good will come of it I
think it's
it's an iterative game for sure in terms
of figuring out what you like to talk
about now
when we met you talked a lot more about
Fitness at the time right and that has
evolved now into more of the one-person
business more of the Creator economy
that kind of thing and I actually am
curious to hear because you went on
maybe a year ago-ish like you got off
the grid for like two or three weeks and
I remember you sent me a voice note
when you got back it was like
you had a bunch of realizations and one
of them was like I'm not going to talk
about Fitness anymore I'm only going to
talk about these things
what happened during that time because
like you said of you can talk about a
ton of things you figure out what you
really like to talk about uh I just want
to know because I think that would be
helpful helpful for people and I can
kind of share my evolution of things too
yeah so I I like Fitness is
well it's a part of everyone's life but
it's like a major part of my life that's
the thing that I started with that's the
thing I've experimented with to no end
and during that time when I kind of just
went off grid and stopped talking about
it I found myself becoming very dogmatic
about like certain things that were
being promoted on Twitter and and it's
not limited to Twitter by any means but
I found myself in this little pocket of
advice that didn't seem
to have the right context behind it and
so I started like experimenting with
uh
like eating raw liver right from like
liver king that's only one example
that's an extreme example and I I found
myself without
it's like yeah I noticed some benefits
but I kind of just conformed to that
mindset of like I'm doing this weird
thing I'm gonna talk about it because it
gets engagement it got engagement that
reinforced it and then I slowly realized
like
okay I'm like pushing this weird
piece of advice that is is helpful
but like I don't want to become one of
the people that just acts as if it's an
absolute necessity for every single
person and I don't have the time to
uh
like if I were to keep Fitness in my
brand I really feel like I'd have to
dedicate so much more time to it to
bring like the holistic perspective to
it in order to properly educate people
and so that didn't feel right to me
throwing some things out here and there
where it's like
like a tweet or a video where it's like
here's how to 10x your energy eat raw
liver drink Mountain Springs water right
uh put salt in your water and all of
these little esoteric things that are
straying further and further away from
the principles of Fitness or or just
Health in general the high level stuff
the basics yeah and then and then I
found myself
stopping
or feeling bad if I
like didn't abide by it like if I had an
artificial sweetener I'd be like I need
to tell Twitter that like I need to
confess for my sins and so that's when I
was like okay this I'm stopping all
of it and then I like went in the
complete opposite direction just to see
what would happen and so I was like
eating and this was like a conscious
experiment where I knew that I may
damage my health and so I was eating
like more fried foods I was going out a
lot more
um
and I I learned or I kind of like came
back full circle to
just experimenting and finding what
works best for you and if something you
just have to be conscious of the
mistakes that you're making through
self-reflection where it's like if I go
out one weekend and have a good time
and maybe have too much of a good time
drink way too much and it's impacting my
work and my goals and everything else
and it's preventing me from making
progress and I don't internalize that
and I let that drag on and those goals
continue to go unachieved then yeah
that's a major problem and I need to
do something about it
but that's the that's the thing that's
the entire essence of life is like
making mistakes on your own by your own
doing without
where it's like if I hadn't
if I hadn't gone
if I hadn't like
consciously experimented with
the the fitness information that I had
in my head like the knowledge that I had
around Fitness and consciously put
myself in a place where I was going to
make mistakes then I wouldn't it would
just
I'm having trouble articulating this
where it's like
you need to make mistakes rather than
adopting one specific diet business
model relationship ideology you have to
experiment with multiple things and
figure out like okay how is this going
to
be implemented in my life in a
sustainable way that will allow me to
reach my goals but not become
um
not take over and take away from other
things in life that may be beneficial
that that was the big takeaway I got
from it is where it's like writing
anything off for good even if it's like
the worst thing in the world which I'll
probably never touch like the worst
drugs of course like maybe who the
knows but
like you have to approach it from the
place
of
I don't know you can't you can't find
what you enjoy if you don't
find what you don't enjoy right that's
slowly becoming well I think where I
think
the higher level principle of what you
just said was when you were writing and
talking a ton about the fitness journey
it was public experimentation
right you were figuring it out as you
went but it wasn't framed as that and
that was exactly exactly and then once
you
once you get those basics down
then you have to start talking about the
new things you're doing and that gets
into the more esoteric side of things
the liver and whatnot and at that point
it turns away from I'm experimenting to
because I'm experimenting with things
that are less of the fundamentals I feel
like I have to justify it like why I'm
doing it in a sense yeah yeah right
and I mean your fitness journey
relatively similar to mine like five
years ago I was 280 pounds so less and
you were never drastically overweight I
don't think not drastically yeah but I
definitely bulked a bit too hard right I
mean so I played football in college and
so it wasn't like I was in in poor shape
but right when I took my last snap
and I could no longer play football I
basically was 280 pounds and said I have
to figure this out I was either going to
380 or 180. right and so as I was taking
my steps I started to kind of think and
write publicly about that of what I'm
trying what I'm doing as a way of
crystallizing that experimentation right
yeah and I think that's the higher level
principle here is you want to be doing
that
experimentation and sharing it and this
Beyond Fitness
sharing that journey is what people are
interested in yeah right because they
want to see that you are
you don't have it all figured out and if
I've learned anything of getting to meet
these people who we've looked up to for
a long time they were figuring it all
out
along the way as well yeah right and so
that takes a lot of pressure off too
right instead of
hey I need to go be an expert in this
and then tell everyone that I'm an
expert
yeah and completely flip it and say I
actually have no clue what I'm doing
most of the time it'll work so much
better so much better so much easier and
you learn because of that right you take
that beginner's mindset of I'm going to
put things out through the lens of
here's what I'm trying here's what I'm
thinking
anyone else interested in this and this
goes back to how you attract those
people it's hey I'm running those
similar experiments too right so
I most of my tweets and content and
things I'm thinking about right now are
always through the lens of
I'm trying to learn this it's like a
reminder to myself or here's what I'm
currently learning I'm gonna try to
distill that and then hear what other
people have to think about it yeah and I
think that's why I was so
I liked watching those people so much is
because they approached it from they
approached everything from an open mind
where it's like this is what I'm doing
it may work you should try it out
but it
it doesn't matter at the end of the day
like this isn't the end-all be-all and
that's what I started to realize more
and more with social media and the more
you get on it and the more you get
immersed this can be a very potentially
dangerous thing for people that are just
starting out is like finding those
little pockets where people are giving
out confidence or confident advice which
is a good thing but you have to approach
everything with a critical mind and you
have to take into account the context
and goals that everyone is working
towards
um
because this applies to much much more
than health and this is also another
reason why I kind of like went off grid
is because I found myself in a like
radical pocket of the internet and
it was people
like it was all the covid information or
even uh like wearing masks and other
things and I started intentionally
exposing myself to other sides of the
argument so I started researching the
opposite like are seed oils good for me
right and I found some stuff but then
that just showed me that any side can
any side of any argument regardless of
Health politics whatever it can be
argued on either side to the end of the
world right and just picking one side
without regard for that seems to just be
the source of suffering in someone's
life when you attach to some form of
idea or ideology that is the source of
your suffering because you're gonna like
when people challenge it or people are
getting results with something else then
it's going to threaten you and you're
going to feel the need to defend that
and it's only going to dig those pockets
of the internet deeper and deeper and so
that's what I'm trying to move away from
is to try and give more holistic advice
where it's like I like the one-person
business model I love Twitter
and I'll give you all the information I
can here but I try to preface everything
with like make sure this is aligned with
your goals like if you want to try it
out because you have nothing to try out
go ahead and do it
but at the end of the day like there may
be a better option for you and I want
you to keep your mind open to that and
not
get in these petty little arguments
online about the best Outreach strategy
or the best way to write a tweet or the
best way to grow on a platform it's like
there's so many different ways to do it
and the fun is found when you that's
where the joy in our lives come from is
through experimenting and figuring out a
solution creating some form of value and
then passing it off to others in a
non-dogmatic way that's like where a lot
of joy in my life comes from have you
found or you ever read that article from
Paul Graham keeping your identity small
it's all about it's a very good article
it's all about you want to minimize the
number of labels that you give yourself
right I am a someone who follows the
ketogenic diet or I am a
intermittent like whatever you that's on
the health side but the more labels you
attach to yourself the more
you are going to fall victim to
consistency bias which is chaldini's
like number one driver of human behavior
is
aligning on
some kind of identity you formed for
yourself right so when you prescribe to
a specific
Dogma right and then you do something I
think your point on the source of
suffering is literally acting out of
alignment to some kind of label or
identity that you've crafted for
yourself it can be spun in a positive
way too this is something I've been uh
writing a lot about not in public but in
private for now until the book launches
but
um I think Naval said this somewhere
where your purpose is your axis of
suffering and so you have to choose that
wisely and I like to frame it as
conceptual survival where
you
so when you identify with some form of
an identity or goal or label whatever it
may be your actions are going to follow
suit in order to survive that identity
right since we're
since we're like humans and we
conceptualize things like the
the the principles of survival don't
only apply to our physical nature but
you can like note those patterns in the
mental nature right the mental plane of
life and so if this is how I frame the
four hour work day right or just like
working four hours is if I identify as
per a person who works four hours a day
with an open mind then my actions are
going to follow suit in order to only
work four hours a day right and anything
outside of that is going to be
registered as a problem and so that's
the source of your suffering but it
allows you to like just that alone makes
the problems reveal themselves you can
become aware of them and then you can
work in about in a
or your actions are just going to follow
suit almost automatically
kind of to solve those problems and
start to work four hours a day and so
it's like if I identify as a writer then
my actions are going to follow suit and
I'll eventually become a writer right
and so that's kind of what I mean and so
if you're identifying or labeling with
these unconscious goals let's say of
society that they project on you like
the conventional example there's nothing
wrong with this like
but go to school get a job retire at 65.
those are what most people's goals are
when they are a kid they don't question
them they don't think about them and
then their actions follow suit right and
so you have to take that and that's the
source of their suffering but if you
take that frame it
figure out what you want in this life
identify with those goals Loosely it's
like firm beliefs held Loosely I really
like that saying yeah
and it actualizes like as long as you're
consistent with it I
part of the number one I had like 10
takeaways from last year so last year
coming I love those takeaways by the way
yeah that was a lot of fun I mean I
spent an entire week in Sedona Off the
Grid no phone like let's think about the
year because next so today's what the
25th of February four days from now will
be my one year of leaving BlackRock so
one year no no full-time job which
definitely the best year of my life but
I made it a priority to get that time
off the grid at the end of last year to
reflect on it because I saw such a
pivotal year in my life but one of them
was
me especially but I think this goes for
a lot of people is the liquid takes the
shape of its container right where when
you craft some kind of container like
you talked about of I'm someone who
works four hours a week right and you
find out what those actions are that
either vote for that type of so I love
the quote from James Clear of like you
become the type of person you want to
become by
I don't know the exact quote but your
your every action you take is a vote for
that type of person so overwhelm
yourself with evidence is another thing
Alex hormones he says it's like figure
out who you're trying to be and then
gather a ton of evidence for that person
and I've started to do that with
um identity lists right so an example
would be if you want to label yourself
in something that you want to live up to
right so you can go the other direction
like we talked about of like being very
dogmatic or if but you can spin it in a
positive way of aspirational I want to
be someone who works four hours a day
what does that entail I need to be
focused I need to be organized I need to
be whatever and
you can what's hard about that kind of
behavior change is it's not very easy to
see tangible progress towards that right
it's hard to
think in your head like what is that
evidence and so what I've started doing
is anytime I want to start some kind of
behavior or make some kind of change I
just make a list
and pin it as a note in my phone and
turn
any action I take towards that I just
put it in there
right and so I'm gathering this big list
of evidence over time that is supporting
that thing right so if you were to do it
with I'm someone who works four hours a
day it could be I plan my day the day
before right and it's fun because it's
now kind of hacked the dopamine of I
take those actions because I know I get
to go write them in that identity list
right and it's like it's a new source of
of gamification in a sense of like I'm
going to take those actions that's going
to
reinforce my belief that I am that type
of person and then that flywheel starts
to spend more and more and I've been
experimenting with that because
I have to be careful with those labels
or things I give myself because I will
execute them and for a long period of
time without looking up right and same
For Better or Worse right yeah it could
be if you do it correctly it's a
superpower but it obsessive
personalities like we talked about
applied to the wrong thing not good so I
have to be careful about what those
labels are
yeah
I like the I I told you I need to do
this but
the identity list is good like I want to
come back and frame it so would you
summarize it as like you have a goal you
make a goal conscious and then
you're working to
change your behavior to actualize that
goal and with every thing you do
that will help you reset you write it
down to reinforce that and then it
becomes that yes it's like you you start
to do it so you can write it down yes
and it right reinforces it so an example
right
I have a big frame I'm trying to
develop right now is a mindset of
financial abundance right so I grew up I
was by far the poorest kid
in my neighborhood in my friend group
all of that right very you know
financial situation not good
I've been able to break out of that
through
various things working whatever
but there are still behaviors and
beliefs around money that I can tell are
were entrenched at a young age
and and for a while I was like what it
what does it actually mean to develop
some kind of abundant mindset around
that and now I just have a note of
I'm someone who has a abundant Financial
mindset what does that mean well I
always have more than
um what I need and I operate that way
right instead of hoarding things that I
have I let money kind of flow as energy
or something like that right so an
example would just be growing up like
tipping a valet driver right I think
learn from my dad or something like that
of like ah they didn't do that much like
don't worry about it right yeah and you
think that that's kind of a normal thing
but that is a sign of scarcity right I
can't be tipping that extra amount those
are little things but now like I tipped
a valet driver 20 bucks and I put it in
that note right and then it's like
stacking evidence against or for someone
who operates that way right and
you know I have that I have some others
that we could talk about but that's
really what it is right and as I'm going
through that scenario of like here he
comes with the car I feel that belief of
like you don't tip valet drivers right
they're just doing their job something
like that
yeah but then I know okay if I do this I
get to go write it down and it's silly
but it works and that starts to
reinforce because over the last six
months I have like a hundred things in
that list that I can then read through
whenever I you do that for a long period
of time and what I've been trying to do
is just gather one thing per week on
those like six or seven things that I'm
trying to do
if you do that for a year you have 50
pieces of of evidence right where you
just read in that note of like am I that
type of person well
I've taken all of these actions not
every action has been perfect but it
becomes a
source of truth that otherwise kind of
stays out there of like am I really
making progress on this so that's been
you know I started doing that this year
and it's been really helpful yeah I'm
gonna start doing that too but this
popped a question
um that I have for you is like how has
your relationship with money evolved
over
from the time
I I wouldn't say high school but like uh
from the job you had possibly even
before that if you like had a different
like maybe a part-time job before that
into getting a full-time job into
starting the business and trying to
balance both and then like where it is
now um
so a couple
ways of going about that one I I think
starting back in high school
so I have been financially independent
from my parents since I was
a sophomore in high school
in terms of
any kind of financial help from them
like getting any kind of money at all
really sophomore junior year because I
started to tutor uh on the side in high
school
and I was getting paid ridiculous
amounts of money like at the time 40
bucks an hour as a tutoring math to you
you find a way of tutoring SAT Math is
like the most profitable thing because
you're pricing off a value right yeah
the parents are very in that early right
I learned that very interesting because
the parents are like you're gonna save
me a ton of money if you just get a
score up and I was just good at math
right I don't remember my math score but
it was pretty high oh right because this
like potential scholarships exactly
right and so any there's some some
business Alpha for anyone looking to
start a tutoring business don't don't
tutor subjects tutor to a test but
anyway
I was making a couple hundred bucks a
week and that was absurd at the time I
mean you have a hundred dollars in high
school like
I have everything I need for a long time
and that came from
I mean
2009 I was
13 14 years old right 14 years old kind
of started High School my dad worked in
real estate that was a zero at the time
and my mom was Raising me and my sister
so
it was pretty much like figure this out
otherwise you're just going to be kind
of stuck in this so I tutored junior
year
built up enough money where I was like
okay I I feel very confident in my
ability to earn right
bought my first car for eight hundred
dollars cash underneath the highway
uh it was a 1990 1995 Ford Explorer with
like 150 000 miles bought it in cash
drove by like I all my friends had brand
new cars for their 16th birthday nice
trucks nice this I didn't get a car toll
my senior year High School uh second
semester bought it with cash
um
I say that because I have been building
up that kind of sovereign
your own money this is what needs to get
done and in in college same thing I
tutored pretty much the entire time I
worked an internship and then that led
to working at BlackRock
so I still remember
I started working this only full-time
job I've ever had I was an intern there
going into my junior year and my senior
year of college worked there for three
years
completely only job interview I'd ever
had like everyone else was running the
gamut of like oh wow
tons of interview like 20 interviews
banking all that and I never had to do
that
but
even when I started there I was like
this is an absolute dream job I'm going
to make 100 Grand a year like an absurd
amount of money and then I got into New
York City
and that that like feeling of scarcity
came rushing back because
I'm making that much but 50 55 of it
goes to taxes right I'm paying an absurd
amount of rent and I was like here I am
damn I didn't know that uh ripped all
our New York people oh yeah no I mean
seriously it's fit like 50 so the take
home rent or take-home money of like a
first year analyst in New York City is
negative if you factor in rent you
factor in taxes you factor in any kind
of social activity
and so I was like this was a dream job
for me I thought like oh hedge fund
Trader this is amazing right and I
started working there and immediately
was like this this doesn't fuel
like right I felt wealthier when I was
just a tutor like where I could ramp
things up
and that was extremely uncomfortable to
get back in that situation like oh dream
job
oh wait no it's not like you're stuck
here you were not even saving any money
you're not earning you're barely able to
invest past what you spend on a monthly
basis
and so that was paired with
the Vivid image I have in my head of
someone on my floor asking their boss to
go to their son's Little League game
and their boss saying no
and this guy was in his early 30s
mid-30s something like that where I just
knew that I wasn't going to work a
full-time job forever but I didn't quit
right away I just started to kind of put
other ideas out there of how could I get
back to a way of earning my own income
right yep back to
being a tutor in a sense right it was a
side hustle and so I just started to put
my ideas out on the internet yeah
when ship 30 started which kind of Skips
a bunch of steps but the original goal
with ship 30 was to make ten thousand
dollars in a year yeah I was like oh
if I can make 10 grand in a year that's
an extra Grand thousand dollars a month
like that was so much more than I was
saving or investing at the time I was
like that's a dream
and I love I love saying that because
people look at what it's said multiple
seven figures now of like you had to
have had that big ambition yeah but no
it started much smaller so
long-winded way of kind of coming all
around this story of
I sought the ability to have control
over my income again where
inputs directly led to outputs yes I was
slaving away
14 15 hour days right learning as much
as I could while I was on Wall Street
but
there was literally no way I could have
done one tenth the effort and that never
sat well with me of seeing other people
who
either worked way harder than everyone
or way less and everyone made the same
that just that wasn't it right so I I
sought that ability to earn my own
um and here we are yeah that's
incredible man and I think it I don't
know why this came to mind but
um I've thought a lot about like why
I've made the decisions I have
throughout my life because I grew up uh
like in a religious household
um I don't like I don't think anybody in
my family actually went to college I was
the first to go to a four-year College I
didn't graduate but uh first to go and
like I was the first to kind of do
everything differently and
for some reason this came up like
the example came up with like a TV show
that would illustrate like a boss
telling
someone else like no you can't go see
their kids and like when I would watch
things like that it would hit hard and
it's like
like the signs are all around you why
like why are you doing this why are you
doing this like what's the distance here
where there's clearly a different path
there's clear that this is a problem
that I don't think anybody should have
to face maybe at times but
and I think it's starting to catch on
and like the symbols in
not necessarily mainstream media but
just media in general are being
internalized by more people and it's
slowly leading to like where we are now
not only as individuals but like more
people being introduced to or the I
would say the internet marketing space
is Shifting away from like what it was
before where it's like all these crazy
funnels flexing screenshots all this
other stuff and it's opening more people
up to
uh the possibility that they can do it
too because I believe a lot of people
can
but the the stigmas are dying which I
really like of
like oh he's just a sleazy salesman or
he's a sleazy internet marketer when
they're slowly becoming things over the
past there's still a few here and there
yeah but the majority of them are like
people are favoring and paying
the authentic people that we used to
like watching not only through attention
but money and more are becoming open to
providing a product or service that is
genuinely helpful to other people
because back then with YouTube like the
internet marketing space was just
starting out as well so they were
creating clothing like the clothing
brands just out of like pure passion but
now if they learned from the internet
marketing principles and were able to
package something up that is like more
helpful you see that all the time now in
the fitness space and like I've bought a
ton of programs that have like I've
toyed with and have
really enjoyed and they've really helped
my life and everyone's giving out great
information giving great guides most of
the time but
yeah
you've said this a bunch where everyone
has
a hundred thousand dollars worth of
product ideas sitting in their head and
will says that too it's a good English
it's very good it's true because
people that are dissatisfied in their
job
maybe don't think they have that ability
yeah right it's a very frame breaking
thing like I said ten thousand dollars
in a year would have been crazy for me
until
that first
ten thousand dollar month and then
you're like oh wow okay yeah that
wasn't any more effort than I thought it
would be
right
and I can see a path to scaling that
I don't know I think people are coming
around more and more to the fact that
the internet has
created the ability
to take the ideas in your head share
them with other people and be
compensated for it and
takes remarkably few people
to accomplish that amount yeah right
yeah
um I want to hear
I want to frame it like this so
I feel like a lot of
beginners until they make this
realization like they're they don't want
to create a product or they don't think
they can create a product even if they
have some form of expertise they don't
see how it fits in the market but even
then like let's say an absolute beginner
right
someone who's just starting out maybe
they like productivity but they haven't
dove into it they have no skills no
interest nothing slight interest in
productivity it's like you don't have to
like while we
oh or I talk about like Consulting
coaching freelancing talking about like
giving actual advice online all these
other things it's like you don't really
have to do that to start a personal
brand share what you're learning because
even a brand it's like they develop a
product for a problem on the market if
you are interested in productivity and
want to dive into it more you can create
a product immediately like I can
go on
you can do it digital but I'll use like
a physical example it's like if I like
productivity I can buy a planner and I
can make my own without any expertise
right and if it's helpful that you can
only know it's helpful if it helps you
or if it helps the market like that's
how you gain the experience is by
actually creating it and putting it out
there rather than waiting until you have
the experience to create the same exact
planner and then put it out so I'm
curious you can uh I feel like you have
something no no no I
you are spot on and
the important thing about what you just
said is you have to pick something
to then go build the skills that picking
that thing does so for example
are you going to say you make that
planner okay you're going to learn so
much about physical products about
marketing about sales all that because
you picked that one thing then
are you going to make planners forever
no more than likely not
but you've developed 50 skills that then
you can switch the foundation and I
think that's where people
get stuck is I don't want to Niche down
because then I have to stay with that
forever
but if you just start talking about one
specific thing from now you don't have
to talk about it forever
but you have to make that choice to go
then build the skill of how do I write
about that how do I communicate those
ideas how do I learn effectively so
I think it'd be interesting to share how
I made my first couple dollars on the
internet was that's what I was gonna
right I I went
30 days of writing Twitter threads so
how this all came about and it's how
this all came together
I started writing January 2020. I was
still working at BlackRock at the time
but I I knew I needed to find new
opportunities so I started writing a
Weekly Newsletter that was going to be
my thing
and 40 weeks in I was writing a Weekly
Newsletter and a weekly blog post on my
blog that basically no one was reading
yeah and except my mom and like people
that I would forward it to Dickies yeah
exactly right yes yes she's been she's
been reading every single thing so shout
out mom shout out mom for who's probably
listening this
um
I'd been writing and felt super stuck
right because I was putting that on my
own blog no one was reading it I was
like this is the whole cracked up like
writing thing and I was ready to give up
entirely and just stick with work in
finance but uh I started to
say okay I'm gonna take one last shot at
this but I'm not gonna write on the blog
I'm gonna write on Twitter
and what am I going to write about well
instead of writing these blog posts that
like I'm not an expert in I'm trying to
like frame myself as an expert in this
thing that I'm not like writing about
productivity that whatever
instead I was just gonna go listen to 30
podcasts which I was already doing on my
own
taking notes on all of them in that kind
of learning consumption Journey
but I just started tweeting Twitter
threads on them for 30 days right so I
was taking something that I was already
doing listening to podcasts every day on
a walk taking notes on them but they
were living in the back of a notion
folder that won I never looked at again
because that was just because I didn't
have the public forcing function of
putting those ideas in a concise way
I wasn't really internalizing them so
right away I was like okay I'm just
going to put those out every day for a
month
what that did was
started to attract people who were
interested in the same things as me
because I was putting them in a social
environment not on a Blog they could
interact with them I was then meeting
people and I
people began to see me as a trusted
curator and source of information so all
of that
all of those benefits just taking
something I was already doing and
putting those ideas out there right
30 days into that day 28
I put one out on Naval
or on biology this was like June 2020
July 2020 so pretty early on like
recognizing that biology had really cool
ideas
um I don't even know who that is apology
srinivasan with uh like the network
State he talks about oh well we can talk
about that later but I I basically
listened like 10 podcasts that he was on
and distilled his world view I was ready
to kind of quit this 30-day challenge I
tweeted it out went to bed woke up and
Naval had retweeted it a bunch of people
and it had four or five thousand likes
my newsletter went from like 100
subscribers over 40 weeks to a thousand
in the next 24 hours right
I recognize the power of consistently
putting things out there
finish up the challenge recognize the
power of putting something out every
single day sharing what you're learning
all that then people said hey you've
done this for the last month do you have
all these ideas anywhere like have you
put them in a product because I'd love
to see all the things you've learned
over the last month I was like no
but I can and I did that for the rest of
the weekend woke up Monday put it for
sale for 20 bucks and made 500 yeah
right
and that was incredible that was the
most
and I'm sure you feel this way too like
making that first dollar on the Internet
is by far the most addicting feeling
ever
and you spend the next
three years is where we're at now
chasing that feeling of that first
dollar again and it's sad that it
becomes normal it's very sad and I try
to keep that perspective uh in a big way
but
all of that came from just doing
something I was already doing putting
those ideas out there and then one
person asking me hey is there some like
distilled anywhere and I said no
but would you pay for something like
that yes and there we go
and the number of things I learned from
putting that for sale on gumroad how to
launch it how to fulfill it all that all
started to spiral and that eventually
led to ship 30 and all that yeah this is
why this is like summarizing in a better
way one of the YouTube videos I made on
um I've changed the title like five
times to try and boost it because I know
there's so much like in there but it's
called like learn new skills fast uh
something but it's the same thing it's
like start then build or no start then
learn so you have to actually build
something right then it go this goes
back this is becoming more and more of a
pattern of like Behavior change where
you're trying to survive a project right
that project is like a structured goal
in a sense where it has
other things that bring Clarity to it
but this is also why I recommend we
could go into like
where you think personal branding or the
Creator economy is going to be but I
genuinely think that everyone that is
interested in this should have one they
should have a personal brand of sorts no
matter if it's for increasing career
opportunities if they're not like
interested in business just yet because
employers are hiring from the value that
you provide but dude building a personal
brand I had learned this stuff
previously but
when I was building mine
it was incredible how many skills that I
had to have to make that work and how it
could introduce me to all of these
skills and the skill Stacks the skill
stack that I need to develop right
because it's like I need
I need graphic design for my banner and
my profile picture I need some form of
like visual composition knowledge uh I
need to understand what creates a
compelling bio which kind of revolves
around top of funnel persuasion I have
to understand like
how to write content short medium long
like what the purpose of what what's the
distinction between like content and
marketing in in terms of like a sales
page writing or like an email like how
does that all flow
uh how do I take that idea and design it
in a way that goes on Instagram how do I
actually build a product or like then
you Branch into okay I need to monetize
this build a product learn the skills
associated with that it's like the
skills like I feel like people or like
what skills do I learn it's like you
need
the goal or project first and then they
all reveal themselves and if you aren't
getting results that's like okay what's
missing here because that's another
thing that I could talk on and on about
is
persistence and iteration where it's
like if you aren't seeing results
and you're about to quit because or
like the most tragic thing is when
they're like this doesn't work this is a
scam whatever and it's like dude you're
just
you're not paying attention you're not
at least trying to find what the Gap is
and realizing that you aren't skilled
enough to make this work that's another
thing is you can think that you're very
skilled you can attach to that label in
a sense where it's like oh I have a I
went to the Market's wrong I went yeah
the Mark is wrong I went to grad school
to get my PhD in writing uh this is
shipped 20 for 20. why is nobody buying
it and it's the same thing where it's
like you can
I feel like credentials can hurt you a
lot in in this space and especially
since it's evolving
my framework for this is just in time
versus just in case learning where
what you just said of creating a product
the number of skills that go into that
and not even creating a product but just
creating some kind of Internet presence
too many people are like oh I need to go
read these 10 books before I start doing
anything yeah but you have to have a
lens to apply what you're learning if
you do not have that lens you are not
going to learn anything so way too many
people spend time learning
just in time or just in case right
my framework for this
is have you ever heard this I've written
about this story but of two men learning
to fish
I think I have I don't remember details
so
two men starting to learn to fish
and one of them
goes great it's time to learn to fish
I'm gonna go grab
every book on fishing there is I'm gonna
go get a custom fiber specked out Rod
I'm gonna go buy this brand new boat I'm
gonna get all this stuff ready I'm gonna
spend six months preparing to fish
and he does that right whatever
the other
fisherman goes time to learn to fish he
grabs a stick
he grabs some rope or line attaches a
hot dog to it goes down to the lake and
throws it in
catch is nothing on day one and then day
two he's like okay I have to learn from
this why didn't I catch anything today
well I was probably in a bad spot let's
go try this spot I go there oh I got a
nibble but now my rod broke that means I
need a better Rod okay I went and got
that right every single day he iterates
while the other person is doing all this
high level uh camera yeah it's
procrastination disguised as
productivity by the time the other
fisherman Gets Ready finally feels ready
to fish gets on his boat he gets down
the lake and every single fish is gone
the first fisherman has sucked it dry
he's now running a fishing business that
helps other people start learning to
fish he's running a restaurant he's got
all all because he just got started
yeah and I love that because anytime I
want to start something new in my head I
go grab a shitty rod and start fishing
rather than go try to have this perfect
plan because that plan never works out
and you don't understand what you need
to execute that plan
and that
has stuck with me for so long
and prevented me from right
launching a product but saying nope I
need to write read these 10 books before
I do it I have to feel ready you're
never going to feel ready
and that's been very helpful for me yeah
but when I when I write my newsletters I
have to reframe it so much because it
belongs in every single one but like
whenever I enter some form of
step-by-step advice the first advice is
always settegral or the different frame
project whatever it may be and
it's because I like to think of
it's again another principle where it's
like
you can start to perceive your life from
your future self which is a goal in
itself right that's a good lens to go
about life because let's say My Future
Self
um or my ideal self you could call it is
fit right and let's say right now I'm
not fit and then the situation comes up
where I'm tempted to go to a buffet and
eat a bunch of right and if I
didn't have that lens to view the
situation from and how it could impact
my future then I may make the bad
decision or
like I wouldn't be able to learn from it
I wouldn't register it as a bad decision
right or a mistake
and you're supposed to make mistakes so
I'm not saying like yeah but it's the
same thing with
learning because that's so that's such a
huge lesson to learn where it's like I'm
building this thing and now I'll read a
book on it because I'll pick up those
like that's how you register what's
going to help survive that project right
when you are like okay I'm trying to get
fit
and I'm scrolling on Twitter and now
it's no longer mindless consumption
simply because I have a goal and so I'm
going to pick something up even if it's
not related to Fitness I can see a tip
like a mindset tip and I'm like oh that
that's good that applies to my goal I'm
gonna try that out implement it but if
you don't have the goal to view that
from that's just another tweet that's
going to scroll on by right so you see
Life as a whole you notice things you
pay attention to life in a completely
different way when you are working
towards things
and that is how
I frame someone asked me about it the
other day what do you write about and to
me it's always writing about what I'm
learning at the time
for a year that was learning to write
because I hated it in school I
recognized the power of it so I spent
basically an entire year learning that
skill and sharing and now I feel very
strongly about it
now as I learn new things and we can
talk about
some of the projects we have planned
over the next like three to five years
I'm simply on a search for what are the
projects I could take on such that
the byproduct of starting that thing is
tons of new skills
that I don't currently have yeah and
that is at the moment
not quite there yet but the shipyard and
for you yeah the master facility right
so
you think about something like that of
an in-person
gym
Cafe
I just smile thinking about it because
it's like everything I've wanted for so
long to to be able to have
um
and what goes into learning something
like that so real estate
I have no clue how to do any of that
right now right legal stuff of operating
a gym operating a
reception area all of that
publicly documenting that Journey on
YouTube what would that look like that's
a whole new skill and so as I look at
any time I'm starting a new project I
say is that going to guarantee that I
learn a bunch of new things if it's not
I don't take it on starting to write on
the internet was a forcing function for
me to learn all those Basic Marketing
sales
everything right now the new thing is I
need to learn 10 other things this
sounds like the perfect thing that I
could spend three to five years on
yep
that's how it that's how it was with
like I'm building the software right now
as well where it's like
I know a bit of code like I definitely
couldn't do it by myself no way at all
um but at the same time it's like the
challenge is what makes it fun and
I've
like through what we've done we've
proven to ourselves that we can like
really make anything work like it's let
it's it's not fear anymore it's just
like challenge like what's the next
challenge I'm gonna take
but with the software it's like
I'm big on the one-person business and
I'm kind of labeled as that right so
there's things which are challenging my
beliefs there where it's like okay I'm
gonna have to hire a team
I'm gonna have to manage that team which
I don't know if I'll like or not but I
won't know if I like it or not if I
don't do it yeah right because that's
the other thing is I can
I'm personally at the point where it's
like I'm happy to like it's just fun to
build stuff like I'll put money into
this knowing well that I don't I don't
have any plans to like get rid of it but
one day if I get rid of it because I
simply like it doesn't belong in my life
or it's like causing too much of that
suffering I'm gonna get rid of it and
I'm just gonna let
like I'm going to lose a lot but that's
that's what you pay to learn in a sense
and then your life gets better because
of that because you're actually building
and allowing problems to come into your
life so that you know
what you don't want and how you can move
forward in a different direction
one of my core values things I want to
always be spending my time doing is
progression progressing in something and
anytime I feel that I'm not progressing
it means I need something new to take on
or peace the balance peace and progress
that's my that's my motto lately is like
make progress
feels amazing like when you're
making it a lot of it but then it can
get to the extreme where you don't have
that piece to balance it out where you
didn't go to Sedona for a week to do
whatever you don't have these habits in
your day like me going on a walk right
where
it's the middle way I'm I'm I want to
write a piece on this where it's like
the spiritual Warrior or the spiritual
materialist where
like I personally don't see
like
getting getting rich
buying fancy cars having a lot of money
that I don't see that as the the picture
of absolute evil that some people paint
it as right
that's like a personal thing and so if
it's not balanced in the sense or you're
just like pursuing it to pursue it for
status then
why but really we're pursuing it now
because or I'm pursuing like bigger and
bigger things now because it's taught me
so much like it's led to me refining My
Lifestyle because I've gained so much
experience doing that that I'm able to
come in and actually create some form of
a life like it's not absolute it's not
absolute progress like the the
businessman you know the typical picture
of like a workaholic so it's not
absolute progress like a workaholic but
it's not absolute peace like a monk I
feel like
those two polar ends are collapsing as
we like move forward because there's so
much information coming up that we're
able to synthesize it and understand
life from this balanced
perspective
so many things there
it's
finding that balance
through extremes is how I've thought
about it where
I try to avoid operating in the middle
of yes peace and progress because that's
where all the horrible results come yeah
all the negative results come from
I'm gonna try to make a little bit of
progress but I have a lot of Peace like
work life balance never made sense to me
right
I always think of it of polarity yes I
want to be heads down absolutely
cranking out
15-hour days for long periods of time or
I want to be completely off the grid
with my phone on airplane mode and
that's how I achieve that middle ground
and I do that with a lot of things of
of any kind of intensity bring it
or totally shut it off yep and I think
you can do that on a macro level
on a year right I I work very hard for
12 weeks and then I take a week off I
think you can do that on a micro level
of
50 minutes of work 10 minutes of break
something like that and I think you
could unlike them whatever the middle of
macro and micro is but like on a daily
basis I have periods of intense work and
then yes periods of completely like that
applies to every time scale right where
the opposite would be I spend most of my
day
kind of doing nothing I spend most of my
week kind of in that middle I spend most
of the Year kind of in the middle right
and then you look up five years later
and you're in the same spot yeah I think
this adds the much needed I don't know
if this is what he meant but I think
this adds the much needed Nuance behind
um
I actually don't know if anyone said
this but it's like every everything in
moderation
even moderation like the key word there
is even moderation meaning you aren't in
the middle you're moderating how much
time you expose yourself to each extreme
and letting that
like teach you the lessons of life where
it's like you go through you're gonna go
through Seasons I like to think of it as
like chapters in a book right and each
chapter has
a purpose or a purpose that you're
pursuing right and so
when you achieve some form of a purpose
you're going to
potentially like unless you it really
depends on life situation but a lot of
the time you're going to like get
launched into this phase of feeling lost
or like you have you don't know what's
next you don't see it the light of the
at the end of the tunnel because it's
too early in the chapter right and so
you kind of have to stay mindful test
goals learn from certain lenses move
forward and then
to me a purpose like that Clarity is
built over time just by going about life
consciously like noting those little
things that can apply to a better future
and then like a puzzle right it's you
start piecing it together it starts
taking shape and then finally you put in
one piece and you see like this part of
an image and you're like oh okay I need
to move further in that direction and
then this side starts to take shape and
then you finally put that last piece in
the puzzle and it's like we're going all
in on this like I'm obsessed for the
next six months like I'm building this
out
no matter what and nothing is going to
get in my way
so what is that for you right now
because I think you spent that time off
the grid right you came back
realized that you wanted to go harder on
the one-person business Creator economy
creating your own ideas shaping however
you would Define that right now and
it worked right you came back with that
clarity
blew up on YouTube blew up on Instagram
honed in Twitter right you could see all
those pieces start to come together yeah
as that
I don't know if you've you're reaching
the end of that season or just the
beginning
right that's where my head's at for you
is is this
the beginning of going even harder in
this direction or how are you thinking
about that right now it's slowing down
for sure because
um if we view like from a very like not
on like a week to week lens
um because there's occasional lows like
that's the other thing is like there
will be one day where like
don't really feel like doing anything
today I'll try and force some stuff out
but
just wait it out but
um
that intensity really started in uh
Texas when I was like okay I'm still
dabbling in Fitness here and there but
I'm not really enjoying this like I
would have to see myself like turning
this into my entire brand if I wanted to
produce the value necessary that I know
I have to actually make an impact in
that space But I also have this unique
frame of the one-person business that I
can take a long way and so that's when
like digital economics was born to our
writer was broken off of that
um and then after that that gave me like
throughout the entire that entire time
that started giving me more clarity for
the closing of my book and so I had
written that previously the first draft
and then when I had that Clarity I went
back to the book and I reread a lot of
it and I'm like this is dog like I
can't believe I thought this was good
writing two years ago when I started it
and then I started re-outlining it
refilling it out and then that Clarity
started building again with the book and
then in I want to say it was like 30
days I wrote the first draft like it was
done
230 pages and now I'm going through it
with the editor and so
that's kind of like on the come down and
the software is kind of like on the come
up because I haven't had to do much with
it right now because the developers are
still building but I'm slowly piecing
together
the puzzle pieces of like a marketing
strategy uh like who I'm going to reach
out to or like what kind of content I'm
gonna do like how am I going to position
it and all that fun stuff but right now
uh like the book is being edited it's
coming a bit slower
um it's less out of my Direct Control
right now
and so that's slowing down and I'm in
this phase of like I have these projects
that I'm sustaining life is going good
we're kind of in this middle phase right
now but I know that like a very intense
season for the software or book
promotion is coming very soon and I'm
just like waiting I don't know what it
is that's going to cause that click but
I know it's going to happen at some
point
and we're going to build it's going to
be great I'm excited and you're going to
learn so much on the book and software
side it goes back to you're going to
have a completely new lens yes to
the book is shaped like my philosophy on
a lot of things like
uh
like I've created my own lens to like
I've created my own holistic lens to
view life and business from and it's
worked pretty well so far
and it has helped me like go back and
reframe the book and so that's kind of
like what I want to give other people is
like a lens or how to create your own
lens right it's less of a it's both
here's my lens
but I tried to create this in such a
malleable way as possible that you can
like fit it to your own situation and
fill in the missing pieces through
experience
and the book's called article the art of
focus but it's it's not
we're gonna see how it does where Focus
means so much more to me Focus to me is
like it's the lens
right it's less about like okay I'm
gonna sit down and do deep work it's
more so
where is my focus at any given point in
life
like right now where is it what am I
noticing like even uh building the
skills it's like you focus on a bigger
goal
and by doing that and holding that in
the back of your mind it kind of directs
your focus to finding the things that
will survive that goal so to me focus is
life because that's what it is like
focus is conscious attention and we're
in
the age of attention or the age of
however you want to frame it but
attention is foundational and so
focusing that
I'm trying to bring like the unique
business spirituality Life Health tie
everything in
so it'll be unique I I feel like people
that pick it up the art of focus this is
going to be some like deep work stuff no
way you're for like a surprise so it's
not focus in its attention
it's Direction in a sense the art of
figuring out where you are honing your
limited resources yes in a way
yes but more but higher level less
tactical it should be called like the
art of life but uh focus is more
I feel like it's a better lens to
position it towards my audience okay
and to not speak in a very woo-woo
language because that's what I've like I
really like the woo-woo stuff but
I I've noticed obvious gaps where it
turns people off and so I want to bring
the same lessons from like the lens that
I'm bringing it from and kind of like
inject it into people's minds via
something enticing like business
hmm
and are you going to how's that going to
change both on the software side
and the book
what you're creating Twitter Youtube
Instagram how you think about that
is that going to change your content
strategy no it'll give well the software
will because I'll start incorporating
more
um and creativity give a tldr on the
software just so anyone who's unfamiliar
software is like
how to take an idea
make it your own
through like a system that we've been
developing
so
take an idea that you like
make it your own
have some form of a second brain like a
intellectual database right and then be
able to connect and reference those
ideas when it comes time to
start a project so whether that be sales
Pages newsletters articles tweets
um
book chapters
all of that fun stuff so it's like that
so it's a note-taking system
at the highest level but
directed at a lens of creating from
those rather than just Gathering
materials it's like yeah it's like
synthesis okay so like
that sent the software um that's not
what it's called and I don't want to
give too much away okay or the name
because it'll
people could hop on that yeah we want to
make sure we have everything in place
before we start giving out too much uh
but yeah in terms of so that'll like
start to direct me more towards that
style of content sometimes right work it
in
um but the book my purpose for writing
with that was
or at least like what makes me want to
write it is I would look at the comments
like in the comment section and not like
bad ones but any of them and I just
think like they're not understanding
what I'm saying like this is getting
good engagement
but they're on like a completely
different like they have no idea what
I'm trying to get across here like I
need the book or when people ask
questions
and or like questions to help with their
problems I'm like this isn't even a
business problem like I'm gonna have to
approach this from a very different lens
they need the book like I just kept
getting evidence that like I need to
give people the lens to view the content
from so that it is more impactful and so
it's like
and of course it's a a play to help with
like spreading the ideas and building
the brand name in a sense
um
but without
like I'm not trying to make it
actionable or even lead into courses or
anything
um but I want it to be like
when when you think of habits you think
of James clear right and if you've read
Atomic habits you read his tweets or any
of his content from a much better lens
and because of that he gets so much more
engagement in a sense this is my way of
creating a modality for myself to be
able to write whatever I want no matter
how
um
philosophical it is like this is my way
of being able to write what I want to
write and have it be understood when if
it was just a standalone tweet with no
depth behind it
it would do maybe okay some people would
get it but I want more people to get it
because it's the that's like
impacted my life the most
you made this point at dinner
on Thursday of your impact is less about
someone engaging with your content but
more how much
you
you and you should definitely write
about this by the way
when you plant an idea in someone's head
and that goes on to influence a lot of
their decisions it's almost like you are
buying stock in a sense or a venture
capitalist like some kind of investment
because yeah because
when they go on to do a bunch of awesome
things with that idea you are
compounding
you're there
what's the right word
like their gratitude to you
gets more and more valuable right yeah
it's kind of like with ship 30. we're
seeing people now who are building
hundreds of thousands of followers
making hundreds of thousands of dollars
that Equity has been compounding and now
they all are looking back and saying how
did I get my start it was it was with
ship 30. right how did I come up with
these five
business ideas and kind of change the
way I think the art of Focus right this
single idea then plant seeds in people's
heads that go and grow and that
you said that and I went home and
thought about that a lot because that is
the true
the reason James Clear is seeing more
and more success is because he planted
those ideas in people's heads that has
led to such immense change in their life
where their Affinity that's the right
word Affinity to him
has compounded
because of that because of the success
that they've seen
via his ideas they feel like they owe
him even more yeah and that that's a
really cool way of thinking about
creating
and spreading your ideas in the first
place is how can I put something in
someone's head that
they're going to be able to use and
reference and act on and see success
with such that
it compounds favorably for them and for
me yep
no I see this as a this is how I talk
about it in the book I really like the
uh the angle of conceptual survival or
mental survival like surviving on that
plane because there's so many different
patterns you can notice where it's like
in uh
like in our ancestors per se
when they'd pass by like a bear Bush
over and over again there was nothing of
importance there's no dopamine like a
novelty
um that doesn't Aid in their survival
whatever it may be then we're talking
physical survival here and so
one day when it grows new berries
and they're hungry
novelty dopamine they're gonna register
that because it's going to help them
survive right and so if we take that to
the conceptual level and we're trying to
survive a project or goal that we're
working on then we're going to notice
the the novel things
in everyday life that help us achieve
that goal and so with mental survival
there are multiple things that come into
play
and that is
um reproduction like if you want to
frame it that way I like framing it this
way because it's fun but like you're
you're reproducing ideas Concepts and
you're spreading it you're kind of like
creating children really but you're uh
like that's how you form like a
community or a family or like that
tight-knit bond is by spreading those
ideas and if you want to take this from
the spiritual lens raising the
collective Consciousness by doing that
like from A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle
that was like his big point is like you
have to I like to frame it as levels of
mind because Consciousness again
like people can get turned off to
woo-woo stuff not that Consciousness is
woo-woo but I like to frame it as levels
of mine so you are educating and
entertaining and inspiring people as a
Creator and reproducing your ideas on
the spiritual or mental plane to help
raise that Collective level of mind
so that we can solve better problems
right because a lot of people get stuck
in these low-level problems they don't
have the
they don't have the income they don't
have the body they don't have whatever
and this whole self-improvement space
and Creator economy is getting to the
point where more and more people have
solved those base problems in their life
they've solved their biological problems
to the point where eventually I think
automation AI Tech and I know Naval has
said something similar to this at some
point but they're going to take over a
lot of the groundwork like a lot of the
productive mechanical robotic ish style
work that is against human nature and
then once you solve your own problems
you open up that mental space to start
solving creative problems to start
entertaining yourself or not
entertaining yourself but
you start to survive on that mental
plane
and and it becomes a lot more rewarding
and fulfilling that way
because
one your mind is expanded to the point
where you don't really get trapped in
these little
like Petty thought bubbles or pockets of
the internet anymore per se occasionally
maybe you might but
that that's kind of on a very high level
where I see things going
um
eventually and I really do think like
that's why I push the one-person
business model a lot right now is
because it kind of I like how you I like
the term forcing function I just
registered what that actually means but
like
the one-person business model is a
forcing function for improving every
area of your life and this is why I
think the Creator economy can't get too
saturated because people evolve it's
like if if I want to start as a web
designer but then I learn enough where
it's like I can create something better
then I desaturate the web design market
and someone else can take my place and
then everyone evolves in their own
unique way and then they get to a point
where it's like I don't really even need
this anymore I want to go and pursue
building this business because I have
the resources to do so like you go and
look at I'd say 50 of the YouTubers with
over a million followers half of them
don't even post like they stop because
they've reached the point Hamza Hamza
just stopped like at least completely
or they're just very inconsistent with
posting so once they reach a certain
point once they've
actualized that purpose or whatever they
were trying to achieve and they stop
they open up room for the rest of the
people so it's individuals and
communities
evolving
through the internet through the mental
plane right that the internet is kind of
how Minds interact now
education is never going anywhere nope
and that to me is the foundation of
Creator economy is you are figuring out
ways to do things and sharing it with
other people
now you make an interesting point that I
want to pull on a little bit of
AI Tech automation solving a lot of
these problems
allowing you to then work on higher
level things yes
there's another side of that though
where
if you are not putting yourself in a
place to leverage those
you are not going to solve those
problems so it's
maybe they take care of
where I just I I have the the picture of
Wally from the movie where they like
that people are 500 pounds and they're
sitting there and it's like every
dopamine receptor is hooked up to
whatever you need because every other
problem is solved and it's like all I
want to do now is
that right
I think it's either it's going to either
widen the gap or close the gap oh I
think it everything is going to widen
the guy I mean
technology is an accelerant of polarity
in my opinion where the people who use
it look at what we're doing right now
this podcast is going to reach
thousands of people who maybe more like
who knows
and that is a benefit because our ideas
are able to spread that way
automation Tech all of that you can arm
yourself with it and
it's all going to turn into a power law
where the people who use it effectively
are going to continue to capture more
and more and more and more value you're
seeing that with wealth in general right
now like the highest leveraged
individuals in the world are Jeff Bezos
Elon Musk why because they've used
technology and Automation and labor and
everything in the right ways to ascend
to the highest levels of Leverage
possible
that is only going like we look at now
these trillion dollar companies
versus how like
all the smallest come like
relative
how much more valuable they are than the
smallest that is only going to get wider
the most powerful individuals are only
going to get more relatively powerful
than the least power like the bottom of
the spectrum and that's all technology
is going to do so that to me is
terrifying because
if you
don't see that happening
in five years passed by and you're still
not figuring out a way to use these
Technologies it's
it's it's game over yeah
yeah you're eating crickets you know
that
which is scary and this is what like
again this is why I don't think that the
space can be saturated like I think
there's a needs to be more people
because like awareness of this is the
first step like some people have no
 clue what's coming like
like we're in a decent position because
we started earlier but the only way
people are going to start is if they
have the awareness of it and people are
actually talking about this stuff right
like some people people that listen to
this and actually decide to start from
listening to this they're and a 100
times better place than someone who
wasn't didn't even know this podcast
existed
100 100 times ahead of anyone that
doesn't
just listen to this put you in a certain
level of awareness of these because
otherwise you're just kind of an NPC
this goes back absolutely but in terms
of like oh yeah yeah I in that domain of
Life playing and understanding and
staying that's why I'm extremely
grateful for getting on Twitter two and
a half years ago
yeah because I was immediately exposed
to those ideas that completely reshaped
what the trajectory I was on
where
you work that job
you slowly increase your income because
you slowly increase it you slowly
inflate your lifestyle so you're always
stuck right you make more but you
accumulated more recurring costs because
of that and then boom you're 35 you're
40 years you're done you're stuck golden
handcuffs yeah right
so I'm extremely grateful for the people
who I started following and learning
those ideas and
it's also important to preface that it's
by no means too late to start doing any
of this oh no way like not even close
yeah
and and as I said it's like you
you have to start in order to learn the
skills
like listening to this isn't frankly
it's not going to do much aside from
Prime you to start
that's it like it's up to you to start
and then figure out the rest as you go
and learn from the people that you
resonate most with like that's what I
like about that's what I love
about all of this is kind of individuals
becoming their own Public Schools or
building like brands that are somewhat
public schools that people can attend is
that they all have different
lenses from which they teach and they
all attract people according to those
lenses do every single time
um
in digital economics the like my bigger
course I have everyone do the Myers and
Briggs personality test and I've heard a
few times that it's inaccurate but this
is still like super interesting to me is
that I have all of them take the
Myers-Briggs personality test and treat
it as their customer Avatar to like
write start writing to
um
but it's insane how many are so similar
to me where it's like I'm supposedly
infj and then when people join they're
like oh what are you and I would say 50
plus are that like you attract who you
are and that's who you can help best
that's why I'm so big on like you are
the niche is if you just help yourself
help your past help self like right
through your problems right now give
yourself advice uh like kind of use
social media is like a note taking
software like where you're putting these
ideas that you're sharing
um
you attract people that are like you
especially if you share your interest
more and then they're going to resonate
with your style of teaching much much
more than some general curriculum or
someone else's school and so it creates
its own filter
where everyone I mean buyers buy again
and they're all going to buy different
courses over time but you're eventually
going to like
gravitate into your own little pocket or
community of people and then you're
going to be able to become that
Community the way I like to distinguish
it
um is like
dominator dominator hierarchies versus
actualization hierarchies where
Dominator hierarchies are like a classic
one is like a pyramid scheme or like a
like Alpha ape that gets all of the like
female apes and like his choice of food
and everything to himself or like a
business structure like a corporate job
structure where like
uh there's less people at the top more
people at the bottom and just by sheer
probability you're not going to be able
to most people 99 of people aren't going
to be able to get to the top of that
ladder but in this Creator economy like
it evolves that's the entire Point
behind the actualization hierarchy is
that it transcends includes and it keeps
evolving right and so
anyone can get to the top
it can't really prove this but like it's
a much more
I don't even know the word for it it's a
better way like we're slowly
finding these different solutions for
people to be able to make a living doing
what they enjoy
with technology like that's I I firmly
believe that like technology
whether it's unconscious or not is like
solving the base human problems that
we've been experiencing so long
yeah and it's just slowly moving more
towards it
tactically we talk about this in ship 30
as the two-year test
where
they're probably a good chunk of people
listening to this right now like this
all sounds great but what the heck do I
start talking about and
the immediate framework we teach in the
first week is you are going to write to
yourself two years ago
so what does that mean
inside your head right now
are hundreds of thousands of ideas and
Frameworks and lessons and things that
just over the last two years you've
developed
because they're part of your life now
and you've internalized them you think
they are obvious to other people
yeah unlocking those and getting
comfortable realizing that you are an
expert in a lot of things is that
the gateway drug to creating on on the
internet yeah it's wow I actually do
have things to share and so we force
them to come up with a list of 20 things
skills you've built Hobbies you've
started life transitions you've made
mistakes you've made jobs you've started
jobs you quit things you've learned
that's looking backwards and you can
write about all of those things to the
person you were two years ago who would
do anything to have that information
and if you do a good job distilling that
the internet guarantees there are
millions of people on that exact same
Journey as you and they're only going to
be more and more of them
exposed to those ideas over time it's
only going to grow
also you can look forward two years and
say maybe I don't neces I'm a complete
beginner I'm 18 years old I'm I don't
have that much first off you do because
just how you got to here means you have
something interesting to share
but you can look ahead and this is
really the path we've taken at the very
beginning
look at what you want to learn over the
next two years
yeah Marketing sales branding health and
fitness all of those and go curate the
experts of those things yeah and that is
the evolution of right there are now
people who are curating our ideas
because they are saying I'm looking up
to these guys I want to learn from them
let me go dive into their world view
curate it they're going to better
understand it they're going to share it
to the people behind them and because
and this is interesting to see come full
circle
when you do that curation you then have
a new Foundation of ideas that you can
put your own spin on your own personal
expertise right that's what keeps
compounding and
I like to share that because it can all
this can sound good
but then what do I actually do to get
started so for anyone watching or
listening make that list of things that
you've learned mistakes lessons failures
transitions or and you can do both look
forward what are all the the that that's
your raw material to then go share and
the more people that do that the more it
compounds because then new people come
in and they learn from those and you
just keep ascending and ascending and
that's why
your point on it never getting saturated
so is so important because there's
always going to be evolution of everyone
yeah and new people coming in and new
people to learn and new nuances to share
yeah and that's the I think that's the
distinction here is that it's
the
how would we
label it like the the
okay Creator economy I would label it as
the Creator economy because being a
Creator implies growth
um but like I like the word Creator
because it does that but let's say
influencer
that's like that could be static like
the influencer economy can definitely
get saturated greater economy assumes
that you're consistently trying to make
progress in life right as on an
individual level and the community that
you are
bringing up with you both are evolving
um
the the other thing is that like people
I I see this take a few times online
where it's like especially on Twitter
Twitter is very raw and has like those
unique little Twitter specific things
where it's like oh when people are one
at 1 000 followers they can talk about
whatever they want and blah blah blah
and then when it's like you get to like
a hundred thousand followers and they
start doing all these platitudes and
it's like it's kind of like it holds
meaning right to me I I slowly have
shifted over time into like much more
pithy big picture stuff because all the
other stuff is documented and then that
holds a lot more meaning to me now and I
truly feel like it's a bit more
impactful for just like
keeping people like nudging people to
stay on the path and so it's interesting
how the content evolves with it too and
like what you talk about how you talk
about it why you talk about specific
things over others and
of course it's not absolute like I give
out actionable stuff all the time it's
just like I J me personally I prefer
that just high level information that
reminds me
of
good lessons to use as like a part of
the lens for me to go about life
you're still growing when you're sharing
that information I think that's the
point is it yeah at the very beginning
you know that and that's what's
important about it is as you were
sharing those things in the very
beginning it was you making sense of
that
once you have made sense of those
low-level things you only can Ascend to
the high level things right you know or
you pick a different angle right of I'm
gonna go start this in person
Mastery facility that has
a cafe grass-fed steak bowls things like
that and now I'm going to share those
ideas and that would be you'd go back
down to low level
of what is it what is it what is the
actionable stuff right
and that's what's so fun to me is it's
all I want to do when I'm creating on
the Internet is learn new things
document it and continue to grow picking
that
thing to go and learn is the fun part
yeah because you can you can choose
anything you could not
take the path of going and starting an
in-person facility or starting a
software and just purely go I want to
completely understand my own
philosophical mind and that's my new
public experimentation yeah
I like the shape this is taking because
it's like
it's it's figuring it out at scale but
it's really just making sense like sense
making the sense making as like a very
broad topic is very fun to dive into
like podcasts on people that just talk
about sense making from like a
philosophical perspective super
interesting but
like this it sounds like you're just
making sense of your path in life in
public and the things that you want to
share like if I'm I'm in my life I'm
going to be interested in maybe like 10
things
with dedication and then my entire job
is to become
like those are the crevices reality of
reality that I am dedicated to
synthesizing making sense of and
creating with right so my Creations or
the value that I'm putting out in the
world or my business like
if you label business as like the way
you distribute value to the world
that's what you're doing is you're just
packaging up and making sense of the
very unique that's another thing that
decreases the saturation is that your
combination of interest that you kind of
Trek through
and like leave your own path in over
time online or even in a physical
location anywhere is like what you're
doing from a very big picture is you're
just
learning
facting up distilling like you are the
perspective vessel that
things are like passing through
and the byproduct of that
you're going to attract people
who are on the same path as you
which is the whole goal of that's why
we're sitting here is because very
clearly when I came across your profiles
I know exactly the type of thing this
person's interested in very similar to
me even if you even if it's not like
directly like it's weird how you have
that sense where it's like I like this
guy and then the second one is you learn
it faster if you are doing that
distillation when you had the lens of I
am going to be sharing this information
with other people it goes back to my 30
days of podcast where I learned I still
to this day some of those Frameworks I
learned during those 30 days sit top of
mind for me because I took an extra
amount of time to share them in a way
that other people would find valuable
yeah and that's what excites me when I
go start the shipyard and I sign the
lease on whatever that facility is and I
make those YouTube videos I want to
share that process because it's going to
attract people who want to eventually do
that too I'm going to learn it if I have
to share and write up a video on
all of the real estate tax and legal and
implications yeah I'm going to very well
understand that and that's going to be
fun and there's going to be people who
reach out and it all comes full circle
with
I put those ideas out there I'm going to
better understand them the people who
could help me in the next step are going
to say hey you're probably going to run
into this problem next yeah
at the highest level it's start sharing
the things you're doing and learning yep
and you're going to learn them people
are going to help you and that's what
you go back to our very the very
beginning of our entire journey is the
same thing it was let's go figure this
thing out but rather than pontificate
about it
what's that word mean think oh yeah I
don't even know if that's a real word
uh
but
let's go get in the trenches and
actually learn it and share it
hell yeah
what's next on the menu
I think we gotta talk
vision for the shipyard Mastery facility
because I feel like that's Pro we've
talked about it like here and there but
in three to five years when we're
looking back on this as we are
see how accurate we were yeah
I have always had
a vision to
have some kind of in place or in-person
place
and
to me the whole point of
building any kind of business online is
to eventually have some kind of
in-person
manifestation of that community and
make that a byproduct of the type of
person you attract
yeah so
the shipyard and it's funny because we
had these ideas independently we started
talking about it it was like I've been
thinking about that exact thing forever
and
maybe it's traced back to our
original influences of Fitness influence
Fitness YouTubers who who have gone on
to do this actual thing where we got to
see them start a gym at the very
beginner stage and I remember thinking
that is impossible to even fathom but if
we wanted right now we could go start
both of these things we're in a
financial situation that we can do that
I don't think I'm ready for it from a
skill perspective because I want to max
out
I want to get the business side to a
place of
I'm managing more than doing so that I
can give other things my attention and
so we're not there yet but
the shipyard to me is going to have
some kind of gym
some kind of co-working Cafe
some kind of massive reception area
where you can host events
and some kind of I don't know if the
restaurant needs to be in there but some
kind of steak Bowl healthy based style
all of that and it I think and then
obviously an office space where
whether that's a small team whether
that's a big team
that just sounds so much fun to me to go
and do and that's where I want to go
next is
take this idea of the community that we
started to attract with ship 30 of
people who want to write every day what
happens when you start writing every day
every other area of your life improves
you start to take your Fitness more
seriously you start to recognize the
business potential of what you're doing
creating some kind of
place where that person can gather
is very exciting to me yeah you actually
this made me realize um
I've always I was the same way where I
always wanted to start something
physical like I wanted a physical
location of something and at first it
was like
I want to open a cool coffee shop and
then next it was like maybe I want to
open a gym and then next like I started
realizing these problems and it's like
there's not a good gym here there's not
a good coffee shop here
like I want to start one I want to start
one and then the last one as you
mentioned is like
why isn't there a food place where I can
just like create a good bowl like yeah
like yeah Chipotle is fine whatever
modern Market's okay but it's like
where's the where's the Bro stuff like
where's my like where's my steak where's
my white rice what are some seasonings
like where's what I would have at home
just a little bit Amplified without the
and at like a price where I would be
able to pay for it every single day so
it's like all of the problem the
problems in my physical location I want
to solve with the Mastery facility yes
right so it's like have
uh an espresso bar of course have the uh
co-working space have some form of I'm
still ideating this one but like I feel
like it'd be like the
like you know how at Whole Foods they
have like you build your own you put
your food in the box or whatever it'd be
similar to that be like build your own
Chipotle but with like good stuff no
seed oils yeah of course and then uh
I didn't think about like something like
the big reception or like conference
room I don't know if I'd want that or be
able to rent it out because like
well I want the gym as well but
um
I feel like we could have Live Events
there but we'd meet somewhere else and
then it's like we're gonna go get in a
lift or we're going to like go co-work
for a bit in the co-working space I feel
like could double up that's what I think
happens you can clear all that stuff out
of there and that becomes a group if we
wanted to have a presentation that could
hold 50 people something like that yeah
exactly and I think there needs to be
some kind of like mini hotel attached
where that I think that is like the last
level but here's what I already know is
going to happen we would build that
and then
how do we continue growing with that it
would be expanding it or create some
kind of
long or larger scale one
yeah
it will be like the progression of like
Christian Guzman with that's my number
one Fitness YouTuber influence it's been
very cool to see his whole journey
because he's
I think just turned 30 or 31 so he's
like four years older than us and it's
been cool to
see his progression and that's how he's
thinking about it is he started that
home one and now wants to go expand a
bunch of them
obviously that's feature pacing in a big
way and there's a ton that goes into
that but that to me is
where this starts to get fun is you get
to just do bigger and cooler things and
yeah tracing it back to hitting publish
on a newsletter on the very first time
three years ago is absurd to me absurd
because how quickly this can happen
yeah I like the or now I think of um
it's like for people that don't have the
resources to go out and do what they
want to do the internet has created more
stepping stones in order for you to get
there and and allows like people of
whatever
financial position even mental position
like whatever position you're in like
the internet is it's a ladder that you
can create your own
rungs to reach the things that you
actually want to do and generate the
resources to do so
and those
event those preferences will evolve as
you play the game yeah which is fun
I if you would have told me I studied
math and computer science in college
right yeah I if you told me I was
running a writing education company and
writing software company three years ago
I'd have thought you were absurd so
maybe we're looking back on this in
three to five years and
who knows what is accelerated or changed
during that and that's what's fun about
this is you can put those ideas
start to maybe act on them
but here's what I like we talked about
earlier I'm not going to right now go
read a bunch of real estate Tax and
Finance books I'm not going to do
anything none because I don't have the
lens yet but the second I do that is
where I'm going to
place all my attention and that excites
me too but for now
I don't see that
getting my attention for
two years three years yeah something
like that I think you and I both have a
lot more
on the business side to go and do before
we can give that our attention yeah yeah
I just have there's more logical steps
like I was
very close to just dropping like 150 to
200k on
like gym equipment and finding a place I
was very close to doing that and
um I just decided like or I thought
about it I'm like this isn't like this
sounds fun but I'm not all I'm not
bought into it 100 yeah like I'm kind of
I feel like I'm forcing my hand
as to like what's next and so I sat it
out a bit and it's like the software
makes more sense to do right now that
fits the puzzle piece to Perfection
um
yeah it just didn't make sense at the
time it's hard because the solution
whenever I start to think about these
things is almost always just make more
money right now
because then then you have a completely
new lens for do I want to start this gym
okay it's 200 Grand great done yeah
check checks in the mail let's get all
that going and hire someone to do it for
us you know I think that's one of the
like it sounds like pompous to people
who aren't in the space where it's like
just make more money bro but once you
get to the point like once you start
yeah it's like
like if if we wanted to I've said this a
few times like in the newsletter and I
don't like talking about it too much
because as I said like you can it can be
very heavily misinterpreted where it's
like if I wanted to right now I could
probably make
200k in two days if I if I
crafted a promotion strategy I have the
resources available to do so in the form
of product audience traffic whatever it
may be but I may have to step on some
toes
um I don't want to do that right now I
don't really care to do it and
it could like it just it doesn't make
sense you
you would tap into Equity that you've
been building and extract dividends too
early yes that's the entire way I think
about it that's the entire way I think
about it is you are building Goodwill
stacking Equity yep in the beginning you
build a little bit and then because of
your financial situation you need to tap
into that equity and extract some
dividends then you go back to building
equity
extract a little bit of dividend the
whole game is that balance where every
time that you ask you have to kind of
reset that Equity a little bit now
you look at
the people who are building
billion dollar Brands The Rock
his tequila all of those they have gone
a long time before tapping into that
equity and then it goes again yeah
the whole game is
striking that balance balance yep
where if you wait too long then
and it it all changes as you hit these
different levels like it goes back to in
the very beginning when I wanted to make
ten thousand dollars in a year
how I would think about extracting those
dividends is way different where
single emails can generate hundreds of
thousands of dollars now you have to
completely change and
it's way easier said than done to make
that adjustment because two years ago
I I say all the time growth is having
problems today that you would have
begged to have had a few years ago where
you are now facing things that
sure feel stressful right now but you're
two years ago self would have said dude
that's your biggest problem today
like snap out of it man you're living an
absolute dream and that only
every every two years that should happen
if you're making progress yeah
but
[Music]
it all yeah make just make more money
bro it is it's it holds truth it does
hold truth because you start weighing
these things it's like well this would
probably be easier if I was operating
from a better situation so how do I go
do that and then I go do that and then
yeah you know that could change but
if you are
trying to think about where it becomes
most useful
for the advice like just make more money
yeah uh once you know like you have to
well
I I I I don't think the lesson there is
just make more money I think it's you
like have the resources you just aren't
aware
um
that you have them
you know what I mean where like if you
don't know how to just make more money
then you have to do the thing like you
have you can start the project learn the
skills and acquire the information
necessary in order to do so
like right now like or at least over the
next like month six months whatever it
is
Alex ramosi talks about an ignorance tax
it's my favorite term my favorite term
because I've realized that over the last
few years the number one
every time I have invested money and
time into a course into coaching into
some kind of education to pay down that
ignorance tax I've seen 10 to 20 to 50
to A Thousand Times Roi yeah every
single
10x in income I've had I can point to
some kind of
paying down that ignorance tax and so
right now the fact that he says it
at a higher level the fact that he's not
a billionaire is costing him a billion
dollars a year yeah or the fact that he
cannot make a hundred million dollars a
year is
costing him that much and we talked
about this at dinner
because all of those resources are there
at this point that makes me extremely
uncomfortable yeah is it any moment
there is some piece of information out
there
that I could tap into to 10x my income
or reach your growth again and the fact
that I don't I'm not working towards
that is like it's hard it's difficult
because it's there
the path to making your first dollar is
there yeah if so if you haven't done it
you just haven't given it the right
amount of attention
and
that is probably the
biggest piece of advice is figure out
where your ignorance tax is right now
for me is completely different than
where it was
two years ago yeah
same I feel like that brings up I I was
gonna say it it sounds similar to a
concept I have called tactical stress
but that it's a tad bit different where
most of the growth in my life has come
from forcing myself to push to that
point and let my actions follow back up
so whether that be like
um two years ago at some time where I
was like I was very I had a lot of
scarcity around rent I just don't I
didn't like the
potentially high prices like I'd gone
from living in the dorms to like having
four roommates and paying 300 bucks a
month for rent and so I was always
paying this low cost and then
when it came time to move into a nicer
place
uh and I was like looking around and
there was like a seventeen hundred
dollar a month place and I I wasn't
aware of like what
rent prices look like anywhere but I saw
that and I'm like damn that's like
nothing I've ever paid before in my life
but I know I'm at the point in my life
where I can afford that I know I can
sustain it and if I have to like if it's
uncomfortable I can make myself
comfortable paying that like that can
become
um it's like
the opposite of
lifestyle inflation where it's like
I'm going to move here so that
I'm offsetting that
where I have the skill in order to make
10x that and this is going to be what
launches me into that and so it's like
gradually increasing that ladder but
that can get dangerous very quick
clearly but it hasn't in my life yet
um because it's like that's what's like
I wouldn't be here I wouldn't be doing
that thing if I hadn't put the money on
the line and it's just it's the same
thing with coaching where
it's like I know I can make something
work
I don't I don't know what I'm missing
right now so I'm going to drop 5K on
this coaching and every single time I do
that I get what I need and then I
usually stop showing up like I don't
even need it anymore I stopped showing
up because I already made it work I know
I put the pressure on the line
I I got what I needed and I built it and
so the money was kind of just like a
a way to force that
two things there
there needs to be a term for the
opposite of Lifestyle inflation where
you make an investment that forces you
to grow into that
yeah so whether that's striking a
assigning a lease on a apartment that is
out it's slightly in that uncomfortable
range and then right away you go I
better live up to that what does that
type of person do who makes those types
of choices otherwise you're not in
you're not growing right if you're not
making those Investments That continue
to be
what your former self would think is
either not smart but
risky or
not on the the trodden path right I'm
constantly untraining myself from the
take all your money let it compounded
three five percent like invested in the
market invest it whatever that everyone
teaches put it away for retirement
because now
and this goes back to the identity list
at the very beginning
I need to be investing all of my time
and money in figuring out why I'm not
making more money or why I'm not using
my time correctly this this picture of
the ideal scene
is very related to the ignorance taxes
you don't know what it looks like to do
this thing well and that's costing you a
ton of time
and the byproduct of that is it's
costing you a lot of money so I was just
finishing up my kind of quarterly
reflection why I came out here I like to
break my frame a little bit Get Off the
Grid spend some time without my phone
all that it's in the Matrix exactly
and one of it is one of my big takeaways
is that is I have to continue to
anytime I'm starting something new now I
go who knows this and knows what doing
this well looks like how can I pay them
to win back my future time
yeah oh because otherwise I'm just
wasting time because someone else has
figured this out
and now we are in a situation
financially where we can invest in that
where otherwise
like the most direct teaching is
one-on-one tutoring yeah the most
indirect teaching is a book if you think
about
if you could talk to
one-on-one with
Ray dalio to talk about investing or you
could read his book obviously the book
is ten dollars and
his one-on-one time is Millions yeah why
because of how much value you're going
to get in that unique experience and so
that is uncomfortable to recognize
because of those financial beliefs that
we talked about at the very beginning
yeah is oh wow it's five thousand
dollars to do that one-on-one coaching
or course or whatever it is
two years ago that was absurd now it's I
have to be doing that yeah and so
both
I tweeted this the other day growth is
having problems today that you would
have
beg to have had growth is making
Investments today that you used to think
were absurd
um
growth is
saying no to opportunities
that you would think were absurd to turn
down
two years ago
right someone could come to you right
now and say hey I could help you make 10
grand tomorrow
yeah two years ago you'd be like
tomorrow yeah like where do I sign
and that to me I'm I'm thinking more and
more about this what are those
indicators of growth yeah and saying no
to Opportunities making uncomfortable
Investments having problems today that
you would have begged to have had those
are
things that you have to stay on top of
because otherwise you're not going to
continue growing it's dangerous man
where
like I apps I I'm trying to figure out
how to get rid of this
where I could probably I can just
Outsource it but I hate checking my
email like it's very quick too it's very
quick because I have filtered it to the
point of like I don't get too many but
when I do check it it's like I need to
practice more gratitude with this where
it's like there's just money sitting
there where it's like uh grammarly wants
to sponsor the video
this person wants to sponsor the video
this person wants to like sign on for
coaching it's like I'm not I can't do
any of this like I'm not doing it and if
I entertain it it just wastes my time
like frankly I wastes my time
um
but the
what you meant man I I had something for
this but
oh that was like the main oh when you
I've never understood the
like it wasn't made important to me the
whole like investing in some form of
like retirement account
um that wasn't really a thing when I was
younger but it became more of a thing
when I started doing this and I started
exposing myself to financial advice and
it's like once I I was already in the
spot where it's like
like why
I don't see the importance in this
because you're asking me to set aside
this much for this amount of time in
order to make this much when I could
just do this instead and use this money
to make 10x that amount in a year like
why would I do that
you know what I mean like I'm setting
aside this money that I can't use at
this very critical point in my life to
put towards better
results
because there's never been
the Returns on that money have never
been as easy to multiply as they are now
yeah because you can consume new skills
that quicker than you ever could have
yeah to then compound that topic yes
right
other the reason investing in the market
was because you worked a fixed job with
a fixed salary that had a fixed amount
and the only way to grow that income was
through that right you can if you were
working a nine to five where your inputs
are not tied to your Financial outcome
it makes no sense to try to invest in
yourself in that way
but the second you have that Sovereign
lens of
I can earn more the second I
have a better skill set
the idea of investing in the market goes
completely away yeah I need to be
putting every single dollar into either
something fully
safe that gives me the peace of mind to
go take bigger risks or in aggressively
paying down that ignorance tax yeah of
learning a new skill like that's the
entrepreneurial barbell of investing
your money it's as safe as possible to
give you the peace of mind or as
aggressively as possible to
compound your earning potential yeah
damn
that's interesting like
there needs you could probably frame a
tweet much better the content mode but
uh
it's like investing in yourself
is might like I'm not like I have
trouble seeing right now aside from like
the Bitcoin like hype at the time
Bitcoin hype coin hype all of those
things where like you could
quote 10x your money like you don't
that's like once in a lifetime thing not
once in a lifetime but very very rare
thing that you probably shouldn't Embark
in when the only other way in my eyes in
this point in time to get those types of
returns is investing in yourself like in
what better thing
to be able to invest into because it
just it not only 10x is like what like
resources you have like money and
knowledge but at 10x is quality of life
because you're
you're your own right in this case it's
hopefully an actualization hierarchy
rather than a dominated Harker but like
you can see it's like you're just
investing in the pyramid scheme of
yourself but under the the actualization
frame the only recession or inflation
proof
Investments are in your skills
I love the idea of financial confidence
versus Financial Security
Financial Security is very scarcity it's
once I have this amount of money then
like interest rates
interest on that takes care of me
forever
that is like uh I never sat well with
that I get I just got to get to this
point and then I can live off the
interest one I'd never see myself not
working I'll always be wanting to grow
in some way
Financial confidence is
you have the skills
necessary to generate an income in any
circumstance right and I that to me is
always stuck of how am I developing some
kind of financial confidence with what
I'm doing what are the skills that are
lacking right now what are the beliefs I
have around money that are keeping me
from progressing in that yeah and even
if uh
even if times change we've developed the
personality that we could adapt to the
times
and one thing you mentioned there about
like never stopping working I I agree
because it's polarity again where work
and rest are on the same Spectrum like
it's not like one cannot exist without
the other like work
would either become too boring or it
just wouldn't make sense like literally
the word would not exist if the word or
like feeling of rest did not exists
because they play into each other but at
the same time I want to
what what do you see
retirement like like let's say so in the
time frame like age 65 you're an older
dude
what does like morning afternoon night
look like I have no clue really well I
see myself sustaining a two-hour writing
habit like oh for sure 100 I mean
everything I'm doing right now
is to build the foundation to be a
world-class father in the next 10 years
that's good I'm kind of I'm on the
Spectrum where it's like
I'm
doing now no I'm experimenting now or
I'm doing what I
how do I frame this sorry I kind of took
over right there but like uh
people
I've questioned myself a lot when
someone
like wants to do something fun
and I just have no desire to do it it's
like I'd rather do what I do every
single day because I'm living my ideal
lifestyle right now and if that ever
changes it changes and so it's like I
have that power where
right now I would hope that I'm doing
the thing that I'm going to do when I'm
65. if I'm not why am I doing it like if
I'm not gonna do it it's like if I want
to become a writer
why am I not writing every day right now
or every week month whatever it may be
why is it not a habit in my life if I
want to become that already like you're
only increasing the the scale at which
you do it where as a beginner if you
don't have the time or resources like
it's going to be 30 minutes in the
morning regardless of whether you're
getting paid or not right some people
wait until they can get paid when you're
missing a crucial piece of the function
there where like you have to start
before you can learn or before you can
get paid it just has to
like you have to live your ideal
lifestyle right now or at least seek to
create it so that you can sustain it
to me there are certain things that
I know are only going to get more
difficult as I get older
and right now all of my focus is on
building my health foundation and my
financial Foundation to me that leads to
everything else that I want to develop
as I get older
and it only gets more difficult to build
your health and financial Foundation as
you get older
yeah so I look at it that's good I have
to start now on those because
if I can store as much energy as
possible in those foundations
they become quote unquote more passive
over time you have
systems they're exactly more efficient
and so the way I think about this is
maintenance is the same level of
difficulty wherever you're at
so let's take the financial and the
health side
a billionaire with a billion dollars in
his bank account and someone with fifty
dollars in their bank account
maintaining that level of wealth is the
same difficulty
they just put in a bank account
right it earns three percent that person
with a billion dollars of stored energy
makes way more because way more has gone
into that yeah
the person in ridiculously good shape in
the person in horrible shape maintaining
their current health is the same level
of difficulty they just continue doing
the things that got them to where they
are now yeah or at an even lower scope
but getting there
is a lot harder right in both of those
scenarios so
the amount of effort required to get
to that passive state is way more than
most people think
and the level to maintain it is way less
yeah so I look at what are the things
that are only going to get harder to
reach as I get older and it's my health
and financial Foundation because with
that set I think I can go on to
the relationship side of things yeah
having an army of 10 children plus a
giant Ranch in Argentina all of that who
knows where obviously my preferences and
things like that are going to change but
to me those
take care of themselves with these
Foundation set so where I'm at at 65 I
don't I don't know yeah I don't know
where my
I think my
you look at entrepreneurial like Primes
they're always like late 30s early 40s
yeah where people really hit their
stride and so I look at where we're at
as like the preseason of all this which
is very exciting but I don't know where
I'm gonna be at 65 I only I don't know
where I'm gonna be at 35. I have a
pretty good sense of where I want to be
30 and it's
continuing to do the things I'm doing
now I I woke up this morning and was
doing my quarterly reflection and was
like I have 12
blocks of 12 weeks until I'm 30.
and I that kind of freaked me out it
kind of freaked me out a little bit
so 12 quarters
13 weeks yeah 12 weeks whatever 12 12
and 12 sounded better but yeah right
away I was like wow okay what it what
just happened over the last 12 weeks
great awesome progress but this the
sense of urgency I emerged with so short
yeah so short
and only gonna feel shorter as as we go
so I don't know where 65 is I know that
30 is
very similar to what I'm doing now but
just at a higher level yeah
I love that that's part good discussion
even though you don't know what you want
a 65 that was a very good uh
lesson
how about you
I definitely want to write like my so
when I said earlier like the things in
life
I I see it from
the in in terms of like Habits Like The
like progress like peace and progress
right that balance rather than like
certain individual things in life that
like
yeah I'd have to frame it more but what
I really mean is like what's the one
habit that is going to result in
progress which is writing what is the
one that's going to result in peace
which is I mean there can be a few but
it's like walking and going on walks and
so in terms of like very like the
principles of my lifestyle it's probably
the things that I'm doing right now
which is writing walking
reading getting sun when I can it keeps
disappearing on me here but uh come to
Miami man yeah yeah one day soon
um
uh eating good dinners that's one thing
I I remember I was on Noah kagan's
podcast uh the other day and he asked
like what's different between now and
like then and from like the start of the
freelancing journey to now and it's like
I really like fancy dinners like that's
what that's if I'm willing to spend
money on anything it's dinners
because they're so good
and so I want to maintain that like it's
not it's maybe like a bi-weekly
or like a five yeah bi-weekly
thing where it's like we'll go out like
with two or three friends and just have
a good dinner and have great
conversation that those are like
habits I want to sustain because that's
really fun
there's there's certain things that
group dinners definitely up there on
but it's very interesting so I'm now
15 months without alcohol
just experimenting with that because
when I was
at that beginning 15 months ago I was
doing some reflection on
I probably hadn't gone more than a week
without alcohol in 10 years yeah when I
was 25 because I looked like beginning
High School Middle High School whatever
damn right yeah but but it was so
normalized extremely normalized College
you drink whatever yeah
and
why bring that up is
very very nice dinners are not
you can get the nicest things on the
menu for like a couple hundred dollars
if you're not drinking thousand dollar
bottles of wine like that's the power
law of if you keep they can get
progressively progressively more
expensive but like I went to one of the
nicest steakhouses here last night did a
solo dinner was like I want to try
everything on this menu it's like 300
yeah
two years ago three years ago I'd have
thought that was absolutely absurd yeah
but you recognize that there are a lot
of things that are not
that far out of reach when you reach a
certain level yeah and not much will
change like not I don't see very much
changing in my life for a long time in
terms of what I'm able to do again
from certain levels of income you need
100 million dollars plus to have a
private plane or a yacht or whatever
like those are
and I think you you see that
in how people
operate is they hit like the level of
wealth where they can do just about
everything except those things that can
travel wherever they want they can fly
first class they can stay at the nice
hotels but you're not going to be able
to buy the plane or the boat then you
have to go take shots that help you get
to that I don't know what the exact
numbers what kind of to break that down
but
not much has changed and that has been
an interesting realization is that the
things I really really like do not cost
an absurd amount of money that I think
in the very beginning you're like oh I
need this this this no
right and nice stakes are definitely one
of them yeah I'm not honestly I I like
steak but I I per to me they all I need
to try that place that you mentioned but
like to me I have trouble noticing the
difference between like a a nice steak
and a
just like
I I don't know I really like cheap
steaks yeah like in like the thin like
beef jerky-ish that's like my texture
people will hate me for that but I I've
just never liked
I like it yeah I've just never like
loved like a
fatty juicy steak it just doesn't sit
dude you're about to get absolutely I
know cancel all across Fritter that's
gonna get clipped out I was like I don't
honestly this might get me canceled even
more I like
just like
shredded chicken more than steak like
that would be my preference of like a
carne asada Taco versus like a a chicken
taco it's probably the chicken taco or a
fish
the monoton there is something and
you've tweeted about this before of
falling in love with the monotonous
boring stuff is the superpower where you
learn to love
that 100th day in a row of eating ground
beef and rice and when you do but that
that is what unlocks all of the the
progress It's that's why it's enjoyable
yeah it's because you know that you've
experienced the progress to the point
where you know the consistent
consistency with it you can feel the
little progress like you know that it is
just subtle increases in progress even
though you can't it's not tangible you
know but you know you're you're making
progress with every single action
and that's you have to do things for a
certain period of time consistently
before you can recognize that you're
stacking another brick on that every
time I sit down and
heat up
ground beef brown rice two hours before
I hit the gym knowing I'm gonna do the
exact same workout I did on that day a
week earlier and try to add one pound to
each lift and that's the 34th week in a
row I've done that exact one yep
I always I never would have thought that
I'd fall in love with that process but
that's where I'm at now because I know
I've
done this long enough now that I can
project five years of that and say I am
doing the things today that if I simply
continue doing
I know exactly where I end up that's
that is fulfill very fulfilling to me is
that when I can see the actions I'm
taking today
as
inevitable to achieve what I want if I
just do them yeah
that's really it because you know like
that's the other thing is once you've
started you've gotten that result you
made the you've you've applied the just
make more money bro principal across
like all domains like once you solidify
that you've reach that little Peak
then like everything
becomes a lot easier but then you reach
that point where it's like okay time to
experiment with different things
um
here and there just to see how it
impacts the routine like that's what
I've noticed and you mentioned like
alcohol and I stopped for a bit and like
started to introduce it back because I
wanted to
like tackle it right because it was
either like that was my thing is I I
for me personally I I didn't see myself
like winning the alcohol battle by
getting rid of it completely it was more
so okay how do I moderate this so I can
like have that drink at the table
instead of because normally it'd be like
once a week I go and I didn't even have
the intention of having one two drinks
it was I had the intention of having
eight to ten and how do I plan that into
my calories
which which like I do on occasion this
is like every like three months now yeah
where it's like that's a hard reset huh
and it helps and then I realized okay
yeah I didn't like that and so I stopped
for a bit and it's a good it's a good
reminder it's not a very
conducive
reminder to my health but at the same
time I don't think a lot of things are
that we do
but no I I like questioning things a lot
pertaining to that whether it be like
the the diet stuff that we talked about
earlier like specific pure seed oil diet
for a week like yeah like magic foods
but it's the same where it's like I
heard Alan Watts died of alcoholism and
I'm like this dude was an alcoholic and
then I was like
so is he like fake like and so I dove
down certain rabbit holes I started
reading books on like the philosophy of
drinking and like exposing myself to the
other side of the argument and now I'm
not trying to recommend anything in any
way to anyone but that's the thing is I
do think I won the alcohol battle and
it's like we went out to dinner the
other night it's like I had a drink it
was awesome yeah I loved my
first Martini is good the
idea that
complete abstinence from anything is
easier than slight moderation it I feel
like it's way easier and so in my head
I'm like oh I cut alcohol to zero but I
know it's like you take ice baths ever
yeah oh really oh dude you're just
continuing to get canceled
um
it's easier to stay still in the ice
bath than it is to move around but it
feels like it's harder you're like oh
I'm staying here I'm like but if you
were to just flail your arms the whole
time it's actually way harder so with
alcohol it's I cut it to zero and this
is where I'm at right now is I know it's
actually easier to do what I'm doing
than it would be to do what you've done
yeah but it's difficult yeah but I
haven't done that I know that for my
entire life I'm not going to keep it at
zero I don't think and that's with a lot
of things but cutting it to zero to then
reset the slate and then break the frame
yeah of yeah and you know you have that
tool as well because like cutting it to
zero
is better if you're trying to build
things with the saved energy right like
you know that you can allocate all your
energy to something else by doing that
so it's a conscious decision on your end
and I'm still in that season of
I know that
every day that I lose is costing My
Future Self in a big way yeah which is
why I'm I'm sticking with that
and will that be the case for
five years I don't know right I know it
is for at least the next year because I
I've never felt as confident in the path
forward to take ship 30 to eight figures
which is the goal by the end of this
year
than just showing up and doing exactly
what I know I need to do it's like a
literal number of hours away and I'm
sure you feel the same way with once the
book is going live it turns into
or once the software is going live it's
literally just a number of hours of
execution away
yeah
I agree
it's
like what the
yeah the book is the same thing where
like that is the first the book is the
first long-term like super long-term
project where it's like I'm going to be
working on this every day for a long
time like I mentioned how I wrote the
draft in like 30 days but that's because
I spent
two years
or like six months writing the first
draft like very first draft uh another
six months re-outlining it and starting
to write it and picking up ideas like
it's a culmination that's like slowly
improved and it's been that two-year
process that led to that and so that
alone has been great and now it's like
leading to the point of launch and
I'm very stoked about launch like I want
to make it
special to the point of like I want to
do custom covers for like the first
thousand copies with like like silver
foil and I want to send Joey a like
purple foil one because he's been
helping me a lot with it and have like
um like one for you and Justin and both
Justin's and then other people with like
the name engraved on it I feel like
little minor touches would just be
fun I don't know it's one of those
projects where I'm grateful to be at the
point where it's like I can treat this
one as a passion project where it's just
I want to have fun with this without
expectation
when
is it launching I have no idea okay I
don't know how long the entire revision
and editing process takes I've talked to
like one person I've talked to multiple
people but one person said they went
through like eight revisions on theirs
and I was and they were like and I was
like going through mine on the first
revision and it's taking me like a week
to get through
like a chapter or two and I've thought
of eight revisions I'm like this is
gonna take another six months to like
revise this entire thing but I don't
think it'll take that long so I'm hoping
it'll launch
Q3 or Q4 of this year if I can depends
on publishing stuff I'm learning on the
go like I don't even know what the
publishing process looks like yet well
I'm glad you're going through this
because I do want to write a book
eventually I don't know about what I
don't know on what yet but my upcoming
Sprint is getting our go shredding and
coaching up and running which is a
completely different skill than anything
I've built before which goes back to
great what are all the things I need to
go it's going to be hiring a larger team
it's going to be learning to manage
versus do I'm yeah 100 entering and this
is actually my third takeaway from the
quarter is I'm in a consumption and
delegation season not a creation season
um where you are about to enter almost
purely a creation season I'm in a I know
what needs to get built I'm unable to
completely build that myself I need to
go learn the skill and then find people
who are able to support in completing
that yeah and that's been another good
realization for me is that there are
seasons of both
where I haven't been writing nearly as
much this year
and that has been somewhat uncomfortable
but I've been far more in a I need to be
talking to people like my deep work time
is much less because we have a larger
team now and the highest return on my
time is not sitting for four hours
writing right now will that be the case
forever no I intend to go back to
Creation seasons and things like that
but that's been another
area of growth is recognizing what where
is my time best spent right now yeah are
you enjoying that are you enjoying the
managing side of things
or just like talking to more people
instead of the writing I think it's
it's a
slightly different level of kind of
comfort in the sense that there's always
when you're in a
management mode
there's always something you could be
doing to push other people along where
it feels like I'm never completely shut
off from it yeah I'm always a slack
message away from making progress on
that thing
whereas a creation I think I am
cognizant that you cannot be creative
all day yeah you cannot put in
15 hours where you have to step away
from it but something like hey I'm
working with a team of three customer
success managers for our community that
I know I can be coaching to do
things more efficiently giving them
feedback helping them get clarity on
things unblocking them on in certain
ways where
I feel that my day is
longer in that sense yeah and I just
haven't built the skill that's how I
know that it's a skill deficiency
because I feel busier which means I lack
the skill of prioritization planning
delegation execution all that yeah which
degrees of clarity to an extent and
back to the ideal scene I don't know
what that looks like so I'm thinking
about going and hiring a some kind of
productivity slash Focus management
coach for me of hey this is what my day
looks like right now in this current
chapter
where am I just completely off base and
anyone can apply that level of thinking
wherever they're at of hey I'm just
starting to write on Twitter
where am I just completely wrong and
figure out a way to talk to someone
about that and that's where I'm at right
now is I'm entering a new
chapter
I'm probably doing so many things that
are painstakingly glaringly obviously
wrong that I have no clue yeah right I
need to go figure out who knows what the
ideal scene is that can because for me
and you're the same way the second you
see a blueprint to do something
correctly you can instantly apply it
yeah it's like oh wow I'm just been
doing this horribly wrong okay let me
change that but I go extended periods of
time
doing things wrong because I'm unaware
that I'm doing it incorrectly yeah
the way I think about this is
you look at someone who
I don't know the best way to explain
this but when there are tangible
things that you can see so let's just
take someone for example that is very
overweight
that is a physical
culmination of their choices and doing
things incorrectly for a long period of
time
but that you're able to see that so I'm
constantly asking myself where am I
that
but it's just I'm not able to see it
yeah there's no physical manifestation
of it right where am I compounding these
these small decisions day after day
after day that are leading me to being
metaphorically
obese but I just can't see it
yeah that's how I like to put it too
it's like the as I applied like the
survival and reproduction
things to the mind it's the same thing
with like bulking and cutting in
bodybuilding there's so many parallels
where like you bulk and there reaches a
point where you push too far you've
gained too much mental fat and it's
overwhelming and eventually you're gonna
have to cut back down to reveal the
muscle that you built underneath it
right and that is like the new Baseline
whether it be in like monthly Revenue
maybe you do a promotion and you push
super high but that's clearly a spike
but you have to reach some form of a
higher baseline from that you can't just
drop back down
you can but you won't just drop back
down because
that's how it goes it just increases but
in terms of am I enjoying it yes because
fulfillment for me is learning new
things
yeah stop I feel like that's what a lot
of people
um don't realize is they like like
learning one thing and then they can
they or they become passionate about one
like skill but that's because they were
passionate about learning it like the
the psychological processes behind that
that made you enjoy the skill is what
you actually enjoyed you enjoyed the
process but you mislabeled it for the
end result right and so that reframe
would help a lot of people because I
think it's more so you're passionate
about life itself rather than like you
try to find the passion yes
that has been my entire life the
different hats and things so we talked
about I was a speedcuber in the fifth
grade I did that to bring it up I I did
it my fastest one was like 56 seconds
okay I wasn't like I didn't compete or
anything I just loved doing it like so
fun petroleum jealous of course that was
fun I was doing exercises to spin the
cube faster man yeah I took it seriously
nice and then seventh grade I played
professional Call of Duty for a year and
a half oh I was one of the best players
in Florida really on the pro circuit
wait which Call of Duty four Call of
Duty four dude I I had pneumonia at the
time and I that's how I got 10th
prestiges because I was home for three
weeks I was just sitting there with like
the nebulizer mask on
grinding matches and yeah that's such a
good game
but I've always just loved playing a new
game getting up to speed on it quickly
feeling like I mastered it and then
moving on yeah and and that's
metaphorical I would say that isn't like
Call of Duty that's no game it's
everything yeah everything and now I'm
looking at how can I apply that in the
highest leverage way possible so what
what business model what operating
vehicle allows me to
obsess over something new learn it and
then step away from it but instead of
losing all like the amount of time I
spent playing Call of Duty that doesn't
pay me anything right now like if if
that had been a business that was now
compounding dividends for me forever
like that amount of stored effort I'm
trying to apply that same level but
maybe it's a portfolio of businesses
maybe it's whatever I end up choosing
that stores that energy somewhere and
leaning into that is kind of my personal
superpower in a sense yeah
I love that
I feel like mine is
I I'm honest I'm leaning very I've
if the universe has it as it will like
where I thought or I always wanted to
become a YouTuber and kind of came full
circle to that I've always wanted to
become an author too and so like
reflecting on it and how much I enjoyed
this process I could really see myself
like not pushing further in certain
areas simply to write like 10 20 30
books I feel like that would be fun hmm
of all different things like a health
book A A Creator economy book like all
these different ones like how Ellen
Watts wrote a bunch and they're kind of
just random honestly like you just picks
a topic and
Muses on it and it's good and it's fun
and rewarding is the higher level there
that you like to educate
I like to conceptualize like I like to
create Concepts like one person business
isn't my concept but I like to bring new
meaning to it like I like to fill in the
blanks to help people see for so yeah
educating
as a game like not as a
like here's these steps that I've been
told are the steps it's more so
here's the steps that I've learned
from this specific perspective and
here's some other perspectives to help
back that right so it's like synthesis
is my
passion synthesis is fun
I feel the same way
that but there's so many different ways
to do it that's the thing is you like
find the vessel and that could be
the Mastery facility is a physical
synthesis right yes that's what we're
doing and I feel like that's where
things are moving because it's like we
have all of these individual things and
so the next step is like to avoid
saturation you transcend and include
like that's you integrate where it's
like you create something new
by combining them together right and
that unlocks new lenses to go and create
from yeah you're just constantly
evolving in that
you want to take a break real quick yeah
yeah
how long have we been going
what time is it my watch is on East East
Coast time
210 210. so we've been going like damn
like two and a half hours
three hours oh wow damn it's already
three hours that's crazy we need it we
got to keep this part of questions we
keep this part in honestly because I had
no clue we'd gone this far that's
awesome yeah I was lost in that
that is well only take a five minute
break come back we'll Hammer home some
questions
so that was
two and a half hours that I get why Joe
Rogan does this now because that was
immersive I don't so we have this timer
here I didn't look at that one time my
watch is on West Coast or east coast
time so I just couldn't even tell what
time it was yeah and
that was crazy
yeah I thought we were like maybe two
hours in I did look over at that because
that was only set to 60 Minutes for and
that went out fast like I saw it sitting
at zero and I knew that like double if
not triple of the time had gone by so
that's crazy I wanted I want to do more
of these for sure yeah all right so why
don't we finish we asked Twitter
submit questions I think the one
question that covers pretty much all of
their questions are
daily routines what how we spend our
time currently but I also think
how we spend our time currently is far
different than how we spend our time
two years ago um
and I'm always wary of looking at
people's current routines
versus yeah I want to know what they
were doing when they were at my stage so
why don't we you can go first let's do
what was your
daily routine two years ago when you
were just when I sent you that DM like
hey loved the podcast you were on
it was the same hmm uh and before that I
would argue is the same too because like
I've always I've the only I only worked
one full-time job and even then it was
um
I was able to go remote after some time
being there but even when I was there I
it was like so it wasn't lacks but
it was like they would assign me clients
and then I had to manage like I had to
get the work done for them and so I
would just
push everything back and procrastinate
that work while working on my own stuff
for the first two to four hours the only
differences in my routines is that I
used to go to the gym first thing in the
morning and now it's at like two so I've
had the same components in my days it's
just been a matter of like
um
changing them changing the when they're
done around so there's always been deep
work of some kind or deep study and
especially in college like it was more
so deep study and
it'd be like two to four hours ranging
usually two if like I was doing
something
else
um
but right now I'll just go over like the
pieces of yeah what I do and then
tension behind them the why because I
feel like the Y is very important as
well right now we talked about this but
I uh first thing I do I'm experimenting
with morning cardio just like straight
down to walk on the treadmill for 20
minutes uh get sweaty get blood pumping
wake up and the the main reason behind
that is I want to
um not only like have a good way of
waking up and something to do where I
don't have to worry about anything but
that activity right when I wake up like
I don't have to guess okay uh
I gotta am I gonna turn the shower on
first or am I gonna go like make coffee
first and with this it's like I don't
have to shower I don't have to anything
it's like throw on the clothes I took
off last night go get sweaty take them
off shower and then decide and
um
the other thing is that I want to start
paying more attention to cardiovascular
health because as Bros we put that off
for a long time just for the sake of
like lifting weights so that's another
reason but then after that I uh
like hygiene shower make coffee and I'll
sit down and I'll write the book so my
very first time block which is like 45
to 90 minutes right now it's usually
about 60 minutes so we'll just
whenever I say time block let's say it's
like 60 minutes right
so the very first time block of my day
is done at home and it's always
based on the highest priority project
that I'm doing at the time and right now
the highest priority project is usually
something I'm building it's usually not
a maintenance phase
so first time block is always like a
building phase and right now it's the
book
so I've been doing that every single
morning and then after that I will uh
I just moved but I will drive to the
coffee shop I used to walk to the coffee
shop um but I'll drive I'll get an
Americano Just for the sake of I like
americanos keep it simple no decision
fatigue no calories and uh then I'll set
up shop there write the newsletter for a
Time block and and that's more of like
the that's like a maintenance phase
where it's like my content newsletter
outlining the newsletter it all revolves
around like what are the main things
that I have to maintain that I enjoy
doing in business and then after that
I'll drive back and I'll usually go on
like an hour long walk this is when I
like walk a lot if there's Sun out then
I go shirtless and like that's how I get
a tan and I'll listen to whatever I want
to listen to It's not a quiet walk it's
me trying to
the intention isn't to generate ideas
but it is where I'll listen to an
audiobook that sounds interesting I'll
listen to a YouTube lecture I'll listen
to a podcast
um
or something and it can where I can
catch up on like who I missed on YouTube
or something like that and I usually
come back with some good ideas written
down on my phone
after that I'll do the second
maintenance
time block and that is just like
checking in on the community checking
emails that's push back like I have to
do that last in the time blocks because
that will you up if you do that
like first thing in the morning it just
opens way too many loops
um so it's structured like slowly
opening myself in up to the world as
time goes on throughout the day and
that's what I found to be the best and
then after I expose myself to emails and
more people in community then I go
straight to the gym to like kind of wash
myself from that and take out any
potential rage that emails may have
caused so it's pretty well balanced and
then after that I usually I've been
going to lunch
a lot lately that's less like nice
dinners it's more like sustainable
healthy lunches at like solid
restaurants around me so I love walking
to those sitting there just walking
around for like it usually takes like an
hour or two come back check in on
community again and then
that's it kind of it for the day yeah so
you're going to lunch after
gym yeah so it's like you get to the gym
and what what are the times basically on
a lot of those blocks uh so in the
morning I wake up at 5 30.
um morning cardio is usually done by six
I usually can get to my desk by 6 30 uh
right until 7 30. take dog out get to
the coffee shop a little bit around ish
eight get home
by nine no get home by 10. do the walk
uh check in and stuff usually
gym is like 12 31. sometimes stuff
happens and I've been moving right now
so like things are all over the place
but
uh then after that usually back from
uh lunch and errands by like three four
and then
more walks later in the day more that's
like when I can read or just watch
YouTube or
just not work
mine
has changed so much over I think it was
like the little things have but we
remember we were like brainstorming yeah
current currents are pretty similar but
when I was working
in New York and knew I was gonna
eventually
because that's completely different
routine than the one I'm on now yeah I
mean for all of 2021
granted I was working from home at the
time so I did have a little bit more
flexibility but I was still working that
full-time job at BlackRock scaling ship
30 on the side so it was 4 30 a.m to 7
30.
pure writing for a year
or more yeah because I had to be
present for a meeting
at 7 30 a.m pretty much every day for
the three or four years that I was
working there
and
so even
going further back when I was in New
York City
it was 4 30 up because I had to
I was still trying to improve my health
at the time granted
unsuccessfully doing so like I I was
kind of
I experimented with everything I mean I
was on my weight loss phase then going
from 280 down to 220 down to whatever
fasting keto I've tried everything done
everything
um
but it was always 4 30 because I had to
exercise and do anything productive
before I got to the desk at 6 50 7 A.M
and then I'd be under those four
fluorescent lights from seven to like 5
30 or six sometimes later and then walk
home
realize it
I could eat dinner and then start to
panic that I had to be up at 4 30 the
next day and basically I did that for a
year and a half yeah but I share that
because
that is what had to get done
and
people
go how did you
do that working a full-time job in like
the UN Inconvenient Truth is I spent
from 4 30 to 7 30 and
7 P.M to 10
writing learning building doing things
for two years yeah to unlock the ability
to not have to spend that middle 12
hours of my day working for someone else
so I do like to preface that because
that was what got me to
have the freedom and flexibility for my
current day
where I'm at right now it is always a
game of experimentation because there
are so many the
as someone who likes structure and
prefers routine I'm always trying to set
my day up in some kind of repeatable way
yeah
and always kind of struggling with that
because
the growth that the business has seen
over the last two years has met changing
that quite a bit so and I moved cities I
moved from living at home to having a
place in Miami that's completely
different living on my own
Etc
but
the broad blocks that I have are
some kind of morning cardio
now it's funny because we you get into
the weeds of like those little things
where now I'm hearing that you're back
on immediate first thing cardio whereas
I've now gone I'm up at five but I
immediately go to the computer and work
for 90 minutes like I'll foam roll drink
some water do all that supplements Etc
but then I try to squeeze out a 90
minute work look because I've enjoyed
going to bed thinking about one idea
waking up and then executing on that
first thing but I also realized like my
brain fires a little bit better if I've
done cardio beforehand yeah but now I do
the cardio after
cardio
health is important you mentioned that
I'm I'm running like eight to ten miles
a week right now
and enjoying that because I know that
that is hard to maintain in the long run
but I and then I lift it at four so I go
90 minutes of work usually some kind of
creative work
or some kind of immediate learning
but I try to stay away from consumption
early in the morning I think you have
you have pure uninterrupted
I went to bed thinking about an idea I
thought about it all night that's been
marinating I wake up and I express that
and I always have some kind of clarity I
basically go to bed and I write one
thing down of like what is the one thing
I'm thinking about overnight that I can
then do it first thing that to me has
always been one I've had my most
powerful idea breakthroughs
then I'll either run or do some kind of
cardio or yoga or whatever it is on that
I run four three times a week do you go
over twice a week at that in that time
block come back
cook breakfast eat breakfast that's a
new thing over the last six six to eight
months that I've been doing that's what
I've been doing too I'm switching back
to
if oh really intermittent fasting or at
least to experiment again because
like I like eating in the morning I just
find it like and I'm definitely more
full and it benefits my life but I don't
know there's something about
intermittent fasting that I just
genuinely enjoy like the structure of
that it it's and the morning of just
like nothing I'm not eating until this
time so it's decision fatigue yeah but
it's funny because
the two they're 100 at odds of putting
on muscle and and maximizing your
productivity right they are simply
opposite because to truly maximize
adding muscle and building in that way
you need continuous consumption but I
100 operate the best mentally yeah when
I'm fasted but even then like think
about it so you operate the best
mentally
and so decision fatigue and stress like
there's a lot of different things coming
into play and do you know Martin birken
he's like one of the people that helped
popularize intermittent fasting he has
the lean gains method he's like his
whole thing is super like 60 protein
with every single meal and uh fast of
course and do like very high intensity
training three times a week very
compound focused he's huge like
he's jacked he's probably one of the
most jacked and shredded dudes that you
will see he's kind of fallen off
um
but he's like he looks natural too so I
don't think he's taking anything but at
the same time
he blows most
physiques most natural physique right
now out of the water and so it makes me
think it's like
yeah but then it's like yeah but is that
just despite everything he's doing or
because of it I think it's both like it
could be consistency it could be like
he's strong as hell at least what he did
for me is he broke the
well look at Thomas the Lauer too his
physique is insane and he's like huge on
fasting yeah like that's his thing
so my take on it is like almost none of
it matters except yeah calories and
calories and you find a way to get
enough protein like those those we just
went down the rabbit hole a little bit
but it's like oh come back out what does
it mean I need high level you know and
the truth is most of that doesn't matter
and I try to remind myself of that
especially consistency and like
sustainability and enjoyment yes
definitely play a role and I so I've
found that I like taking 20 minutes
eating breakfast on my balcony in the
sun it's like okay I'm gonna keep doing
that yeah and then depending on the day
I either I'm trying to figure out what
days of the week I have
meetings because now I've entered a
season where I need to be talking to
people at the beginning of the year
before I kind of made the objective
decision to at the beginning of the year
I was kind of debating do we want ship
30 to kind of stay where we're at
and execute is in this way or do we want
to try to take things to the next level
with new products new offers things like
that which require more people and Cole
and I sat down and said we want to go
with the ladder it's more fun we're
going to continue to grow
rather than just do the same thing over
and over
so Tuesdays and Fridays have kind of
turned into my pure meeting time
where I'm stacking those days full of
meetings and then Monday Tuesday or
Monday Wednesday Thursday I try to leave
the mornings as free as possible I'm
right now I don't have a set daily
routine in that regard I'm trying to
figure out because of the changes that
were undergoing what that looks like so
I don't have a clear one other than I
lift it four
because I found that
if I was just maintaining what I was
doing I would 100 lift first thing in
the morning I just checked that box and
get it out of the way like when I'm a
dad in the future
up early
in the home gym done yeah right but not
in this current one because I know that
it's better to have meals in me I feel
better I'm stronger things like that
foreign
other things
I'm at like 20 000 steps a day yeah so
any any
thing that I can do away from the
computer
that is not required I take on a walk so
that's almost all my writing it's I have
recognized that I am a audio based
learner I do not read well in terms of
downloading information
but if I hear something I can tune in
and very quickly pick it up and listen
at two to three times speed and have no
drop off in retention versus reading
again I always thought that was some
kind of deficiency now I say wow I can
learn and walk at the same time that's
great yeah all my calls all my right
almost all my writing actually happens
now on walks and same of that's a game
changer so much better especially to
with chat gbt I use it as a formatter
now where I will do a lot of my writing
in bullet points and then I'll say hey
format this as paragraphs
and it'll just take those exact ideas
that I feed it as an outline and boom it
just simply like very does light
formatting changes it's saving me hours
wow um what else
that's kind of it
I try to have all my stuff shut off by
eight and spend the last hour of the day
either journaling or thinking about what
I want to do the next day but that is my
current biggest
weakness in terms of my routines is that
my evenings are very sometimes
not unproductive
and not that every moment has to be
productive but I haven't found out what
I want to do the last hour of the day
yeah because all I really want to do is
go to bed and wake up tomorrow to start
on the next day's thing
which is like it's funny to say out loud
but I want to fill it with some kind of
Hobby and I think it's going to be
learning to play house music in the last
hour of the day oh that'll be good right
because I can completely immerse myself
in that it's so separated from
everything else I'm doing and if I can
just lock into that creatively every
night or some kind of hobby there yeah
is kind of the The Next Step I want to
take no I like that yeah my nights are
usually pretty unproductive like I I
would consider yeah maybe I could I
don't think I would coin and promote
this by any means but it uh
it's like Normie nights that's what I do
like usually by
by seven that's like when it's just hard
cut off where it's like I'm gonna sell
on the couch I'm gonna watch some
Netflix watch a good show
um last Kingdom that show is so
good and it gives me ideas like it
especially if you're watching shows that
are like story based it's like it's like
as you said you're an audio based
learner I'm kind of the same way where
it's like I'd rather clearly I think a
lot of most people would there's just a
lot of dangers behind it it's like you'd
rather go and see a movie and get
immersed in the movie itself to
understand a story and so it's similar
to that
and then I usually
um there's times where
like I don't feel like doing that
anymore I feel like I've become very in
tune with my body which sounds weird I
become very in tune with like I'm
watching this too much like I'm gonna
take a few nights and I'm literally just
gonna go into my room and read for an
hour before bed and so I'm very aware of
that I don't talk about it too much
because I know how it can be spun and
I know that there were times in my life
where I shouldn't have been doing that
because I could have been making
progress in the areas where I was trying
to make progress same with video games
like I don't play video games much
anymore there's definitely periods like
when the new Call of Duty came out I
played that for like a month and then I
quickly realized like I'm not making
 progress right like I need to
cut this out immediately and so did that
but
yeah when it's like seven to nine the
only thing that I am worried about is
blue light but then again I've found
like studies that argue the opposite
Point as with everything it's like yeah
I don't know that's the one
downfall I'm okay with because
I really I've done both options I've
experimented and I don't notice a huge
difference but it could be compound who
knows I try to just avoid destructive
things so what are what are destructive
evening activities it's scrolling
Instagram for for Doom scrolling it's
eating right up close to bedtime things
like that that I know but I was big on
the where we track my sleep once I got
those fundamentals down I stopped
wearing my whoop like six months ago and
I haven't been tired in six months yeah
I know that's a funny thing right
seriously I have not woken up one time
like man I'm tired today whereas for a
while I was like wake up ignore bodily
feeling check whoop score yep red better
take it easy today I'm tired you know
that horror it was a horrible Habit to
get into it was good to get the feedback
loop of what led to certain things but
now I've gotten away with it or done
away with it
and I seriously have not woken up I have
too much to build to be tired and that
is where I've tried to be is
I had to gain that level of awareness
it played its role now don't tip too far
down that of like if if I don't have
my blue light blocking glasses on an
hour before bed and I'm looking at this
then that means I'm going to be tired
tomorrow then I'm tired tomorrow which
means I need more caffeine and if I
market like that's yeah that is the
destructive self-improvement game that
is I have fallen victim to 100 where you
you
listen to too many people's opinions of
what you should be doing until and you
like completely forget that it's all
about how you feel
yeah dude it's the weirdest thing where
like not too many people talk about it
because you kind of have to go through
that ringer where it's like you make the
mistakes yourself
um but I've recently went to like a big
uh party like quote-unquote party with
like a bunch of entrepreneurs and like
talking to all of them there was like
there was like some that were just
passed out drunk like some of the
biggest players that I know just passed
out drunk there was others who were like
it was weird like seeing these high
performers genuine High performers that
can put out and seem to have an
enjoyable life
like doing things like that it was
somewhat refreshing where
I don't know like it's it breaks your
frame it does it breaks your frame and
it makes you think like okay this guy
can do this
like what's going on here they're just
conscious they make conscious decisions
and they know themselves to the point
where it's like if I'm not making
progress I'm changing something and it
doesn't matter how painful that's going
to be it's done like it's already a dis
it's made
right with the games it wasn't even a
struggle like when I played Call of Duty
for a month like it was fun but then
like after it I was like oh my God like
I have 30 minutes to get into bed I have
to do this I have to do this like just
trapped in that thought Loop and like
one day I was just like no it's done
like this isn't worth it for the
lifestyle I have
it's all self-awareness all the way down
it is you have to develop that it's like
the Ellen Watts thing as well where
like he
well it's like a bunch of them like you
you actually when you actually read into
the like stories of these people that we
praise all the time like Marcus Aurelius
the philosophers whatever it may be the
leaders like
what's his name like Alexander the Great
like read their actual backstory and
learn what kind of person they were
and you'll realize like that the frame
that they're promoted from is like a
highlight reel like we all talk about
how to not get sucked into because it
just gives you false expectations and
you realize that everyone's human and
that it's really just a matter of making
beneficial choices and self-correcting
them over time
and I think it's important for people
watching to see that with us yeah
because it's easy to look at that's why
I'm becoming like more okay with like
but that that was a that's another
problem that I don't want to happen is
like if I say I go out and have drinks
and I talk I keep talking about that
because I want to talk about it more
than I just sound like an alcoholic
right right or if I say like
I go to music festivals I love Raves
right I love Raves and I'll go every
like three months when a big one happens
which is like a weekend out of the year
but if I keep talking about them as like
that's my hobby then I just sound like a
druggie raver right and so I have to be
very careful with the
picture I paint
but at the same time I want to get the
point across like
hey you can do these things like you can
you don't have to close yourself off to
any aspect of reality
yeah
it's all reminders to yourself too
yeah because there was probably a time
where you thought I wouldn't I'll never
do those things again if I want to be
productive yeah and it threat it
threatens
like when you set a big goal
you may not want to follow through with
it because it may threaten like what you
currently enjoy doing in your life
right where it's like if I'm going to
build this software
I'm gonna be how I'm gonna like I'm not
going to be able to go to music
festivals anymore I know it's going to
come to like an end at some point but
I'm enjoying them right now and
it's like if I were scared that like I
wouldn't be able to go to one because of
whatever I'd have to do for the software
business then that may impact How I
build or if I build the software
business right when you can like that's
the entire fun is to
treat all of these little things as
Legos in your lifestyle and slowly like
take pieces out here and there and learn
from your mistakes
you can only focus on I think three
things at any given time three kind of
larger picture goals I've been very
aware of that and started to see
evidence that anytime I have more than
three things on a day on a week on a
six-month Horizon so every time I slot
something in now I'm thinking what am I
removing
to add that thing in yeah and that's on
a daily basis if I'm choosing to do more
than three
obviously I'm doing more than three
things in a day but
figuring out what those at what cost
what am I willing to do
what am I willing to not do or what am I
willing to sacrifice to add this new
thing in
and instead of just trying to add I've
fallen guilty for adding more and more
and more in and then I'm never saying
okay as I do this what is that what am I
sacrificing to get that and being
extremely aware of those and it goes
back to the current priorities of like
physical fitness and financial
Foundation that is likely at the expense
of pursuing relationships right now or
yeah you know all those other traveling
as much as I'd eventually like to or
starting these various hobbies that I
know I can get to in the future and
keeping that perspective of
not now
but not not never but not now yeah and
how I remember is that is I'm going to
be able to build anything I want
but not everything and only a couple
things at a time yep extending of time
Horizon and saying yes I will get to
that eventually but right now and this
season not quite yeah
I love that
shall we wrap it up dude
this has been fun that was good three
hours if you waited this long
props to you leave a comment let us know
I mean here what can they call comment
the Mountain Valley Spring water if you
made it this far just comment Mountain
Valley yeah Mountain Valley if you've
made it this far but what I want to make
sure people do with this is if anything
stuck out
think about it distill it
and create with it that's what I'm so
big on man it's like I love that
like I don't like plagiarism clearly I
like people building on the ideas like
like using them in your life and like
plugging them into your own perspective
and then
building from there that's what we're
all doing with like books like in my
book I preface I'm proud of this where
it's like like use these like build with
the ideas take them like if you want to
write a chapter on
if you want to write a book on one of
the chapters that I did and like feel
free build with it just don't like take
it and avoid what results in your own
lessons or perspective with it
the worst thing someone could do is
watch this full three hours and feel
productive because of it and do nothing
with it yeah because then it just it
might as well have wasted three hours
everything is awareness like even
everything you see online all
information is just awareness until you
execute and like make it real
even the most actionable advice in the
world it's still awareness it's like
okay now I know that that thing exists
let me go and do it and then it's real
so anyone listening still still watching
right 10 takeaways from this if that was
at least like the lowest level thing you
did was just write hey here are 10
things I've one thing
start with one
because uh that makes it real that makes
your
effort stored in some way your attention
stored in some way anytime I'm listening
to a podcast now I have to leave with
three takeaways otherwise it was just I
might as well have just been listening
to music or junk food or whatever no but
now it's okay I have a lens I have to
take three things away so hopefully
anyone watching at this point it's got
some good stuff we need to get another
one of these on the books for
a year two years six months should we do
more of these I think people are gonna
like these yeah I feel like we need to
like I want to have a rotation of like
four people and just do it every single
year it'd be like you Joey
Justin Scott
someone else yeah and then just do those
where then because that's the other
thing going back to the very beginning
where we followed specific YouTubers
they had their little tribe like
of like the shared goal the shared
perspective the thing that people want
to hear more of and I feel like that's
kind of one Pitfall of a lot of podcasts
is that they Branch out into too many
different domains not that it's like an
overall bad thing but it can be made
better if you just follow one person's
Journey or like a community of people's
Journey over time and selfishly I want
to have a series that we can look back
on and that was why this was a priority
to get this one done because otherwise
it like we have one on my channel and I
have one on yours from about a year ago
yeah right I think 20 it was October 21
I was on yours and maybe June 22 last
year ish and yeah people can watch those
and then watch this and then they'll
watch the next one and say okay these
guys that I look up to didn't just
happen here or documenting and so that
was the goal with this
I think we covered a ton I can't wait to
re-listen talk through some of these
think about them write about them I want
to just that's my goal is I'm going to
say
what did I learn from you in this
episode that's gonna be my goal with it
so that's all we got
thanks man hell yeah like subscribe sure
there you go
boom
that was fun man damn how long was that
you think
we definitely surpassed three hours yeah
I wanted to I wanted to hit that three
hour break yeah
oh yeah we definitely did
