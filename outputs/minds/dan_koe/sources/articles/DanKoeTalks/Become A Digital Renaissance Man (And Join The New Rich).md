when I was a child I felt alone I was a
rebel I questioned almost everything
that I was told to do whether it be
going to church going to after school
sports or even going to a four-year
College I'm grateful for my programming
or conditioning because it allowed me to
get a leg up on my peers that just
obeyed without question formal education
like college has its place but it has
consistently been losing people's trust
and its ability to secure their future
and I would argue that people never had
absolute trust in its ability to secure
their future but the thought of forging
your own path is just that it's
uncertain you have to create your own
way rather than have a way that was
created placed in front of you so that
your mind can conform to that and have
that Clarity in order to just follow a
set path rather than exploring the
unknown aspects of life that lead to
discoveries insights and anything else
good that you can create for yourself
people inherently know that life
enjoyment is a choice but nobody wants
to face that reality so they Outsource
their quality of life to the
over-exaggerated promises of schools and
jobs it's all too common for people to
spend 4 to 12 years spend tens of
thousands of dollars just to get placed
into a low level entry-level job that
pays barely anything not enough to
survive barely enough to be able to
afford a decently priced apartment and
then they have to still spend another
five to ten years self-educating in
alignment with the job that they got in
order to climb that ladder so to me it
seems like there is a major flaw in this
system you have to learn for 4 to 12
years and then you have to continue
learning for five to ten years while
barely using anything in the degree that
you got now this is like an over
exaggerated case right this isn't in the
case with every single degree with every
single situation I'm well aware of that
I'm just painting a picture of this is
what happens a majority of the time so
the education system does have its
benefits I'm not like absolutely opposed
to college everything is context and
situation dependent but for those that
want fulfilling work and in open free
schedule that you have control over a
glorified piece of paper called a degree
isn't going to do that for you it will
be a stepping stone at Best in a
financial chain at worst so in my case
after five years and twenty thousand
dollars down the drain and another two
years to go if I actually wanted to
complete my degree I was Fed Up and of
course jobs can be a necessary stepping
stone but my conceptual survival was at
stake I had adopted the identity of a
person that would never get a job that
was a goal of mine and I was trying to
survive that goal that's what we as
humans do we survive Concepts and so
when I did end up getting a job it was
like
I died right it was a metaphorical death
of my identity at the time and so that
just launched me into this weird phase
of life where I was just working
constantly to try and get back to
the the identity that I was trying to
hold at that time so I was working even
harder to get out of that job and so
rewind a bit in my final year of college
I came across this class on computer
programming just like basic web
development I took that class and it was
the first one that I was genuinely
interested in in the four years that I
had been going to school and so after
school I spent three to four hours a day
studying web development so HTML CSS
JavaScript on my own with not only free
education platforms online but paid
udemy courses which were like 10 bucks
each for crazy amounts of information
and so this is when the reality of
formal education slapped me in the face
because within two weeks I had learned
the entire College course worth of
curriculum on my own through self
education on the internet and so I
stopped going to class but I still aced
all of the tests knowledge not found in
schools is the source of money not found
in employment we are in the middle of a
massive shift and so when people say
this you're like well
where's the shift it's it's shifts are
slow right you don't think like we don't
just go through an entire Industrial
Revolution in five seconds but the shift
that we're going through isn't specific
to money so the new Rich that we're
going to talk about here isn't about
making billions of dollars getting a
bunch of fancy cars or buying a new
mansion and I'm not saying these things
are bad these can be very useful goals
for exposing yourself to more life
experiences I would argue that uh
pursuing a superficial pursuit of buying
a car is better than sitting around and
doing nothing and when you do pursue
those things and you get them you're
going to learn a lesson very very
quickly that you need a philosophical
pursuit of Mastery behind the
possessions that you acquire in your
life whether they be skills or material
things like a car or a house right if
you do not appreciate it for what it is
if you do not take it from the uh Peri
personal
neurotransmitters like dopamine like you
wanting something you wanting to acquire
something and bring it into your life
once that's over and the dopamine Fades
are you able to shift to the Here and
Now neurotransmitters aka the present
moment and be able to appreciate what
you have by developing a relationship
with it in a sense so if you buy that
car are you going to study mechanics are
you going to work on that car on your
own are you going to be able to maintain
the sense of awe that you have for the
craftsmanship that went into it are you
going to have to study the craftsmanship
of a car in order to appreciate it more
or is it just going to be a hunk of
metal in your garage because you know
how you no longer have the dopamine
associated with the pursuit of that goal
so back to it the new rich is about
leveraging technology for fulfilling
work open schedules and individual
Choice things that are heavily lacking
in today's world so let's break down
each for the sake of awareness this part
of the video isn't going to be hyper
actionable and that's for good reason
it's because you have to have awareness
of a possibility in order to actually
act on something right if I just give
you actionable steps for something and
you don't have that reason or that why
that applies to your life behind it you
don't have an intrinsic motivation to
actually go out and do the actionable
steps that I give you then it's not
going to mean anything you have to have
awareness of what's going on in the
world the opportunities available and
then once that's backed with actionable
steps to bring Clarity even then the
actual steps are just a prescription
right it's just a temporary fix until
you figure out how to do it on your own
so as we go over these just hold them in
your mind as we as you go about life so
you can connect the dots right so you
can actually go online and see what I'm
talking about and be like oh okay I'm
gonna do this so the first aspect of the
new rich is technology the internet has
democratized wealth generation for the
self-educated and self-reliant the
internet allows you to learn the skills
that the schools won't teach and those
skills are often the ones that lead to
becoming Irreplaceable because if
schools can Mass educate
a huge amount of people then those
people are replaceable because then the
next generation of people going through
that same curriculum
you're competing for the same thing
rather than learning in a non-linear way
VIA curiosity and through the internet
in alignment with your personal goals
and not the goals that are assigned to
you by the school system then you go you
forge your own path that way and that's
how you become Irreplaceable by learning
the skills and alignment with
that hierarchy of goals that you are
pursuing so you need to invest time and
money into education that won't lead to
a static salary this should be obvious
so you invest time to get results and if
you have money you invest money to get
results and then you use results as
leverage to make more money and free up
time so the next thing is fulfilling
work anyone can be happy even the Sheep
but fulfillment fulfillment specifically
is a different story you need a purpose
or else you will be assigned one the
difference between a sheep and a human
being is that one is assigned a purpose
and the other creates their purpose
because life is not kind to those that
don't know what they want out of it and
if you don't know what you want out of
life it's not going to come in an
instant you have to constantly think
about it it has to be at the top of your
mind almost every second of every day
because as you're going about life and
you're observing and Discerning this is
an important thing is if I'm in a
situation Asian and I observe I'm at the
grocery store I see someone in a
wheelchair that is very overweight and
their shopping cart is filled with junk
I can discern not judge that I do not
want to end up like that so I'm not
going to do those same actions I'm not
going to fill my grocery cart with those
things that's how you learn and that's
how you eventually figure out okay I
don't want to be that guy I want to be
that guy comparison can be a very good
thing if perceived correctly and it's
the same thing with every single area of
life it's not only who you want to
become but where you want to live what
you want to look like what skills you
want to have how much money you want to
make how much free time you want on your
hand what activities do you want to fill
your day with all of this should be
consistently at the top of your head so
that you have something to work towards
so the third thing after fulfilling work
is empty schedules so with one to two
years of fulfillment work focused effort
by leveraging the internet you should be
able to to have much more if not
complete control over your time income
location and lifestyle and specifically
what you're actually doing on a
day-to-day basis because you've refined
your daily process and workflow to the
point of knowing okay I don't want this
in my day I want this in my day I can
change my products or services or just
what I'm doing in order to reflect that
I can Outsource I can delegate I can
just eliminate altogether because
sometimes things just don't belong in
your day or in your workflow but that's
just the thing you won't have a boss
that is maintaining order in your daily
schedule you have to do that yourself
and eight hour work days endless screen
time and little movement are antagonists
to human Psychology and Physiology
if you are constantly overworking
yourself you are destroying your chances
at becoming more self-aware uh
harnessing your creative potential and
actually creating a vision for the
future this is uh a psychological
phenomenon called the default mode
Network it's a network in your brain it
turns on when you switch from outward
focused cognition like work to inward
Focus cognition that happens when you
are engaging in restful activities this
is why it's so big on working only four
to six hours a day preferably on the
lower end and then stopping work and
focusing on other areas of your life and
incorporating more rest into your days
and so you may not notice the
ramifications of this overworked way of
living because it's become normal to you
and you can't see anything beyond it you
can't see yourself being more creative
because you think you're at the peak of
your creativity right now when that is
nowhere near the case and anything you
say about this right now it doesn't
matter because you aren't experiencing
it right now you have to open your mind
to the possibility of a better future in
order to start to work towards that
future and make new discoveries of what
you are actually capable of so control
over your lifestyle and your schedule
allows you to realign with your nature
or that is to level your psychology and
fuel human super
human super to feel superhuman so the
last thing is individual Choice without
autonomy and without pursuing your own
path or building your own thing your
choices are automatic for the sake of
survival you are literally a robot and
they stem from following the secure path
that has been laid out for you and so
you're living in this constant state of
survival your attention is constantly
narrowed on stressful tasks and
everything else that is
kind of useless in your day but is made
to seem important and so with this one
it's the it's the same deal where you're
not leveraging the default mode network
uh in your brain and two you feel like
you don't have time and you genuinely
may not have enough time for
self-development spirituality creativity
or just doing the fulfilling work that
you want to do for the rest of your life
you just can't make those things happen
if your choices are chained to a
paycheck it's not instant as all good
things aren't but creating an
independent income source is necessary
for those that want full control over
their life now we have to become a
digital renaissance man or woman to
thrive in this new economy of the new
Rich I'm just throwing out Concepts here
and there because who knows what it's
actually going to be there is something
new emerging and we have to
conceptualize it so that people can work
towards that thing so here's a graphic
of the things that we're going to go
over you will make some connections from
the one million dollar skill Stack video
deal that we talked about in the past
but in short what we're doing here is we
are acquiring modern skills acquiring
Evergreen skills acquiring life
experience and acquiring personal
interests and then we are putting all of
those towards a profitable problem in
order to create an Irreplaceable
solution
so that you can make an independent
income and now this is like overly
optimal case right this is once you have
everything right once you're good to go
once you're pretty much set for life
these are all of the skills that you're
going to have in order to book from a
big picture down at a profitable problem
in the market and preferably you're
going to have built some form of a name
for yourself so that you have traffic to
send to the product or service that you
create around that profitable problem
that's all that business is this is like
the over complicated end goal that we're
pursuing but I want you to I want to
make you aware of it because big picture
understanding of all of this is so so
much and more important than the
technical details I could go over and I
could give you step by step here's how
you write a Twitter thread here's how
you write a tweet oh here's how you land
your first client but if you don't
understand what you should be learning
what you should be pushing towards and
being able to make connections on the
way it's just going to be a much much
much more difficult time so the state of
work has seen
big changes since the pandemic
Specialists are out but so are
generalists and now they aren't out
entirely of course you're going to be a
specialist at times especially at the
beginning possibly you're going to be a
generalist at others you're going to
dance between the two and this is just
what the normal world runs on right now
before we
slowly transition until the majority of
people's transition over into this new
rich or new economy or Creator economy
so that's what the normal world runs on
but we aren't here to be normal you
weren't watching this video because you
want to be normal so we live in a time
of specialized generalism and that is to
say the highest paid individuals are the
ones that use the creative ability of
their mind to focus on a specific
profitable problem to deliver above
average results the more skills that you
acquire and the more personal interests
that you research the more awareness you
have at the intersection of those
domains so you can pull from experience
to laser in on a problem related to any
of those skills interests or the
intersections or combinations of both
right like if I were to
study Fitness and study business and
then I want to solve a problem in the
Middle where I create a fitness system
for busy people or busy businessmen then
that's a bit more specific and a bit
more profitable than just like okay uh
here's a fitness program and since I
have an awareness of both of those
domains I'm able to craft such a more
compelling marketing campaign especially
if I have experience in those things if
I've upped my fitness and I've upped my
business then I know exactly how to
combine those two into something that is
going to work because the typical advice
is to Target a profitable Niche which is
good and so if you target something like
Fitness and then you go into it trying
to offer a business service but you
don't you don't have experience in
either you haven't improved your Fitness
yourself and you haven't
self-experimented with a bunch of
different diets and a bunch of different
training philosophies you're going in
blind so all of this stuff whether it be
self-educating or acquiring all of these
skills right rapidly being able to
acquire skills rapidly and practice them
immediately with internet tools it has
only become a possibility over the last
decade thanks to the development of the
Internet history repeats itself and we
are cycling back through a time where
creatives Visionaries and strategists
have the resources available to them to
thrive like they would in the
Renaissance times so we've already
discussed the next two things that we're
going to go over in the one million
dollar skill Stack video but it's it's
worth reiterating these because uh
people need to be reminded more than
they need something new so to keep this
brief make it your purpose to obsess
over Marketing sales writing and
speaking preferably writing because then
you can accurately practice marketing
and sales via your writing and that's
what makes writing good anyways is human
psychology marketing and sales are just
conceptual ways of structuring human
psychology into a way that leads to
a better exchange of goods so all of
those skills Marketing sales writing and
speaking Evergreen skills remember those
they will never go out of fashion they
will never get replaced no matter what
chat GPT makes you think it's just not
going to happen if you were a true
writer speaker marketer or salesman so
they all intersect but they are
necessary for any form of independent
income generation you absolutely need
these skills there is no way around them
this is why artists coders and anyone
else who does not start with learning
these skills fail because they think
they can just put their fancy fancy art
in front of people and expect it to do
good right and some do succeed but
that's only because they were able to
Intuit the principles of Marketing sales
and writing they may not be aware of it
because it's unconscious competence at
that point but they understand
how to speak to a human being in order
to receive something from the value that
they're giving them so to become a
digital renaissance man you will be
learning a variety of skills and
interests that pique your curiosity
right you just are endlessly learning if
you don't have a educational habit
already if you aren't learning something
on a daily or weekly basis whether it be
new skills New Opportunities uh new
interests you weren't watching YouTube
videos on like Fitness or personal
development or whatever it may be and
even then that alone
primes your mind to receive
opportunities in those domains but if
you aren't doing those things and you
aren't practicing skills if you aren't
if you don't set aside time for both
theory and practice every single day
you're not going to win in this economy
why are you watching this video if you
want to become a digital renaissance man
then it's very apparent that you're
going to have to acquire many many
skills and interests in order to
differentiate yourself from everyone
else and if you aren't doing that it's
going to take years to do that so you
might as well start now especially if
you're going to be doing it for the rest
of your life why aren't you doing it now
if you're going to be doing it for the
rest of your life regardless of whether
you're paid or not that's that's the
difference in consistency you do what
you want to do in your future now and
you slowly increase the time you're
allowed to spend on doing those things
and the money that you are acquiring
doing those things those are what
increase with consistency and so the
Evergreen skills Marketing sales writing
and speaking are what allow you to
package up those skills and interests
that you have been learning on your own
into something that is profitable and so
a few YouTube videos will suffice for
learning the the principles and
fundamentals of these things right
Marketing sales writing speaking comes
last and is based off of writing but you
get the point don't don't ask me for
recommendations that that's against the
point that's not hunting you have to
lean into your your psyches nature of
wanting to hunt for ideas and knowledge
and information in order to reap that
good dopamine and make it a sustainable
habit don't Outsource your curiosity to
me now of course if you want to learn
these things in a structured manner you
can either join modern Mastery for five
bucks which is a community and strategy
library or you can check out to our
writer which is marketing and sales
applied to writing in a practical format
online so you can build a name for
yourself and potentially sell a product
or service down the road by being a
digital renaissance man and of course
digital economics is a good option as
well but that has to our writer in it I
would recommend starting with to our
writer and so courses aren't necessary
if you make the time to study and
practice but they are obviously helpful
for those that understand what their
goals are know that the course aligns
with their goals and the course is
streamlined enough but still emphasizes
free and critical thinking in order to
reach that goal so after Evergreen
skills is personal interests what seems
to be the only difference between the
successful and mediocre in this age is
choice of consumption in one camp we
have the distracted they scroll without
intention no goals or focused effort and
then in the other camp we have the
obsessed and the obsessed they research
their interests in alignment with their
future goals and we're going to talk
about self-experimentation and launching
into a season of obsession in the next
video and so the purpose behind this and
learning and researching constantly
interests and alignment with your goals
is that if you want to become let's say
a health expert the help every health
expert online anyone worth following
anyways has a constant finger on the
pulse of the Health Market they're
staying up to date on studies they're
staying up to date on what people are
talking about they're immersed in that
market the same with business the same
with anything if you want to Branch into
a domain or an industry then you need to
be up to date and consistently studying
and learning from the people in that
industry and this is not limited to
social media this is books podcasts
everything now we talked about those
before and as I said we talked about
these in a previous one million dollar
skill Stack video but I want to
walk everyone through a thought
experiment on Creative problem solving
and how important this can get and how
it truly makes you Irreplaceable and now
a lot of you like this little saying in
one of the last videos but one percent
of 50 years is six months and most
people can't last two weeks so all of
this takes time A lot of time and you
have to broaden your time Horizon and
you have to actually think about things
right if we go back to the point that I
Illustrated earlier about school taking
four to twelve years to actually
complete another five to ten years of
self-education to actually uh increase
your salary from that job and climb up
the ladder if you can just stick out
forging your own path for two to four
years you're way ahead of the Curve
two you're able to monetize along the
way you're not just like putting things
off for four to twelve years just to get
through college while giving them money
like weigh the pros and cons and call
yourself out on your own so as
you are pushing the boundary of the
known here's the graphic about
fulfillment you have to push the
boundary of the known you have to
acquire skills in order to match a
challenge therefore you have to be
consistently learning and practicing on
challenges that present themselves in
pursuit of your goals and finding
fulfillment in those challenging
problems because they are intrinsically
aligned with you and as you're doing
that you're shining the light of
awareness on what used to be the unknown
and so by doing this you increase the
volume of your domain of Mastery or the
things that the the field that you were
able to solve creative problems in or if
we consider the unknown the market and
the known your Niche then your Niche
slowly expands and the skills that you
require along those ways a on along the
way allows you to Target a problem
within the niche so here's the thought
experiment there are four small circles
that form the outline of a square right
so in the each of the corner Each corner
there's a circle this first set of
circles represents the Eternal markets
health wealth relationships and
happiness these are where all burning
and profitable problems exist this is
what you should start with if you are
just starting a business you shouldn't
think about starting a new software for
creativity or creating this art like you
can create art yes but you have to
position it into one of these Eternal
markets because you don't have leverage
yet to create whatever you want and what
I mean by that is you need to create art
that hits and implies the problems or
pains within the health wealth
relationships market and you can narrow
those down even further if you'd like to
and now as you develop yourself Within
These domains just just to reiterate who
I talk to in my videos it's for self
improvers people that improve their mind
Body Spirit business right so as you're
improving yourself in these Eternal
markets health wealth relationships
happiness you are solving your own
problems in these areas and as you do
that the circles that we drew earlier
they are expanding until they get to the
point of overlap and then you start
making connections within those things
and that's where you can start to solve
problems all right so let's set those
aside for a second those circles and
let's create a new set but this time the
circles at the corner of the square are
the Evergreen skills so Marketing sales
writing speaking and as you develop and
practice those skills the same thing
happens the circles expand until you
understand that they all work together
and now you apply the same thing to the
modern skills that we mentioned earlier
that you would learn to Aid in this
right Marketing sales writing and
speaking those are evergreen they've
been around forever because humans have
been around forever well kind of but
modern skills are things that people
keep telling you to learn first which
doesn't make sense so they're telling
you to learn like email marketing
Facebook ads Google ads web design SEO
the things that have recently emerged
and that are useful modalities for
applying Marketing sales writing and
speaking and the Eternal markets then
that makes sense so you have to learn
these as well and you don't have to
learn four but you can learn one or two
and you get the same idea all those
circles expand and eventually cross over
so now we have three sets of overlapping
circles and the last piece of the puzzle
is personal interests so let's take me
for example I like uh
philosophy epistemology spirituality and
psychology right so those are my four
that I would put in those circles same
thing as I learned more about those I
researched them over time we're talking
like one two three years here right you
don't need all of these at once you
don't need to study all of these at once
I'm just painting an end goal for you
that you can work towards over the years
so as those circles expand and overlap
the same thing happens but now we have
four sets of those overlapping circles
that we can take and piece together with
four it'll fit into like a pyramid right
it'll go boom boom boom and then a
triangle on the bottom and it doesn't
really work that way but imagine they
all mesh together into some form of a
cube or some form of a pyramid and then
once you place a problem in the middle
of that pyramid or cube then you have
all of this skill and experience that
you can kind of like navigate around the
surface of and then pull from your
experience to solve that problem in a
very unique way this is difficult to
explain because very few people actually
reach this point and this is what it
takes to even build a huge company but
hopefully I'm trying to get people ahead
of the curve here where technology is
allowing the one-person business to
emerge and actually make a substantial
contribution to mankind right before you
need a massive company with a bunch of
different departments that are experts
in all of the things we just talked
about that would form the square right
or the cube and that Cube would normally
be a company and all of the teams work
on solving a profitable Problem by
creating a product or service but the
human mind of one individual can do this
now and they will only be able to do it
more in the future especially when
courses and other things are like zip
files of knowledge now it's such
condensed and specific information to
the point of getting results much much
quicker at least much faster than we
used to be able to and so I I want to
reiterate the per the principle of
nothing happens and then everything
happens right the purpose of me
illustrating those circles expanding
until they overlap is that you're not
going to understand like how those
things connect until you develop
yourself within those areas enough and
then once you do and once they overlap
it's like putting that final piece into
the puzzle and then a messy image turns
into a clear image in your head
technically and so this is the path of
the digital renaissance man they replace
distraction with education and while
sustaining that habit make focused
effort toward helping others as you
develop those skills you can do this for
free for paid in public or in private
freelancing coaching content creation or
whatever method you want to use to get
your abilities in front of the world now
I'd recommend uh watching the one-person
business how to productize yourself to
understand like how to package these
things up more I have an entire playlist
on it on my profile but also remember
that skills must be tested with
challenge if you're bored along this
path it's because you're not challenged
if you're anxious it's because you're
aiming for a challenge too high and your
skill hasn't matched that yet remember
that you have to go through phases
beginner intermediate advanced
so we talked about comparison possibly
being a good thing previously but that's
only if you understand that there is a
gap between you and the other person if
you look at me or look at someone you
admire and think oh wow look at him he's
an overnight success because I simply
can't comprehend that there's a gap
between me and him but that's just the
thing is
be careful when comparing yourself and
be sure to
make a positive assumption assumption
can also be very bad but making a
positive Assumption of okay this guy did
this this and this to get there so I'm
gonna follow that path because I like
our goals align right so in that case
it's not comparison but connection and
so that's the thing skill and challenge
have to match if you do not make an
actual effort to create with your skills
or practice in the real world with your
skills then you are not acquiring skills
you're acquiring knowledge and both are
useful but knowledge without skill is
absolutely worthless because you have to
be able to take what's in your mind and
then use your hands to actually build
something tangible that's what humans do
alright that's it learn act repeat and
don't let your mind get trapped in a
thought Loop of things that don't matter
