the most profitable Niche is you I
realized this after years of pain
excruciating pain caused by the first
piece of advice you'll hear when you
first embark on your journey to become a
free individual Niche down just like the
social Matrix there is a business Matrix
the social Matrix is a groundless web of
ideas that allows Society to operate
cohesively the government and culture
influence the school system the school
system creates resources for students to
learn from the students don't question
what they're taught the students go on
to be parents the parents teach their
children what they know and send them to
school the children make friends and
conform further to fit in the children
grow up get jobs become teachers become
parents become politicians and create
the knowledge and resources online and
Offline that influence culture the
parents students and children vote and
the cycle continues to create the
society we live in the business Matrix
is the same web of ideas that allows
businesses to operate how their they're
supposed to you are a human you learn by
being exposed to beginner level
knowledge then intermediate and advanced
the thing is who questioned this
beginner level Knowledge from the start
are we absolutely sure it is the best
way to go about things is it the most
conducive to results or does it cause
more confusion that makes people quit
too early those that break free of the
Matrix can do whatever they want but you
can't break free in an instant you have
to understand the rules of the game and
acquire enough experience before you can
start playing your own game when I began
my business journey I started with
freelancing I thought it was the most
beginner-friendly option because all I
had to do was learn a skill sell a skill
that's what people told me to do so I
decided to try my hand at freelancing
with almost every skill you can think
video editing graphic design SEO content
marketing Facebook ads and web design I
called myself an agency at this time
because it sounded cooler than being a
freelancer but it was just me so I
wasn't wasn't an agency I was a
freelancer and so are you if you don't
have employees and by the way people
don't care whether you are an agency or
a freelancer my pain point during this
time was always picking a niche I
download free guides and run endless
Google searches on the top 100 niches to
Target I targeted dentists gyms
construction companies and the rest but
what are the problems with this approach
first I don't care about these people I
would and did hate working with them
this isn't a sustainable approach to
something as important as your life's
work you're starting a business for a
reason and it isn't just to have a new
boss second is I don't have experience
with their business most businesses fail
because they try to solve a problem they
have an experienced remember that and
feel free to come back to me when you
ignore this and fail third it
prioritizes finding not attracting or
becoming you learn a skill for someone
else you search endlessly for people to
reach out to and end up spending more
time on lead generation than building
leverage it's no wonder people don't
stick to building a business the
business ideology circling the space
have dominated for too long they are
shallow and lack regard for human nature
psychology and fulfillment I will give
you a better way to go about creating a
niche of one a way that is intuitive
profitable and sustainable now a few
lessons that will spare you a lot of
pain one is that the strong desire to
find the best Niche is a blatant sign
pointing to the fact that you don't
understand business from a big picture
principles versus tactics and finding
the best Niche is a tactic two is build
a product or service that you would
actually buy use and benefit from there
aren't many shortcuts in business but
this is one of them those two lessons
are what changed everything for me now
we're going to talk about my saying the
most profitable Niche is you or how to
productize your mind build a product
that you would buy use and benefit from
write the words that you would stop read
and act on when you know yourself you
get to skip ahead of the 99% of failed
businesses that haven't experience the
problems they're trying to solve most
people don't realize that they belong to
a very specific Niche you follow broad
amount of people with various interests
that have created who you are this is
mistake number one when creating your
Niche if your job is to Target a
specific person and you are a specific
person why are you narrowing in on one
specific interest that you want to sell
a product or service around no it won't
make you more authoritative no people
won't trust you more at best you'll look
like a glorified search engine of
actionable advice at worst you limit
your audience growth and can't leverage
a wider network if someone only talked
about the niche they chose like training
programs for entrepreneurs and
Executives they would only attract those
people this isn't bad but it's such a
small sample size and this isn't paid
ads where you can pinpoint ad placements
to get in front of these people so when
they only talk to that Niche they have
more difficulty at the start fewer
people share their content they can't
get in front of the right people and
they may grow to 5,000 followers in a
year when someone who Incorporated their
interest can grow to 20,000 in a year
after 3 years the first gets to 30,000
followers and the second gets to 300,000
because of the compounding effect and I
hear you saying but Dan those 300,000
followers don't care about my product or
service they're not hot leads they
aren't going to buy from me right away
they're useless
there is a lot to unpack with that
statement first if those 300,000
followers each know three to five people
that they can refer to you that's a
900,000 to 1.5 million follower audience
thanks to the network effect all while
the 30,000 follower hyper Niche down guy
is struggling to have enough leverage to
get out of manual client work second
they're not supposed to buy from you
right away that's the entire purpose of
an education brand you help them go from
beginner content to Advanced product
with time third nobody is a useless
follower you are just so narrow-minded
and indoctrinated with outdated business
Dogma that you don't understand that
people can learn something new that
improves their life by the way I teach
all of this in my digital economics
course now let's break down what a niche
actually is a niche is a worldview or
perspective become a nobody become
everything become a designer writer
marketer socializer Runner bodybuilder
philosopher scientist psychologist and
polymath who knows how to sustain your
obsessive curiosity the universe rewards
those who don't impose their own limits
so let's break down what a niche
actually is and when you are the niche
and who you are is constantly changing
you are nich lless you don't box
yourself into skills or interests that
you will outgrow because you are human
why are you told to Niche down in the
first place so you can understand the
mind of your readers and customers your
told to create a customer Avatar
identify a burning problem they face and
position a solution toward them this
solution is often the same as any other
product with small changes the point is
to make it perceived as valuable to a
specific person by understanding them so
here's a hack is to recreate what
already exists but better and don't over
complicate it so why don't we skip all
of that and treat ourselves as the
customer Avatar solve problems that
we've actually experienced and build a
solution that actually benefits our
lives this eliminates 99% of the guess
work with making money and you don't end
up working with people you don't like in
essence a customer Avatar is the mind
worldview or perspective of someone you
are creating for or marketing toward
from a structural standpoint a worldview
or perspective is composed of three
things the first is goals the conscious
or unconscious goals that influence
every single action you take like taking
one step forward or going to the gym
self-generated goals put you in control
of your life goals frame how you
interpret situations a person with the
assigned goal of society to retire at 60
years old will see fewer business
opportunities as opportunities than the
person with the self-generated goal of
Financial Freedom by 25 years old goals
also frame how you or your readers
interpret books and content two people
with different goals will have radically
different highlights of the books and
content they will notice the things that
Aid in their goals whether they are
aware of it or not so the second thing
that composes a niche or worldview is
problems the conscious or unconscious
problems that prevent you from reaching
your goals or ideal Lifestyle the
foundation of marketing is to raise your
reader level of awareness surrounding
their problems over time if you've
solved your own problems and are helping
your audience do the same you are in a
great position the five levels of
awareness are one unaware they're
unaware of their problem and how it is
hurting their quality of life two is
problem aware they're aware of their
problem but don't know how to solve Sol
it three is solution aware so they're
aware of their problem and know there is
a solution education or knowledge to
solve it fourth is product aware they're
aware of their problem and know there is
a streamlined path or system to solve it
and then fifth is most aware they are
ready to change they just need the right
why that changes Behavior instantly like
when you read an idea in the book and it
changes your entire outlook on life when
your worldview is your Niche your job is
to write in a creative fashion that
increases people's awareness of their
problems that way they act on a solution
toward reaching their goals so the third
thing that composes a niche or worldview
or perspective is potential paths so the
last piece of the worldview puzzle is
Clarity when people don't have Clarity
on their next steps they feel anxious
overwhelmed or bored this is what causes
arguments in relationships dissonance in
business and battles between political
parties people who don't share the same
worldview are missing pieces of the
other party's path narrative or system
that allows them to make sense of that
situation so when you are the niche your
job is to create a holistic step-by-step
path that you can share with readers who
have your same worldview usually in the
form of a product or service that you
can be paid for that way they are more
likely to get results and understand you
there's a reason why my philosophical
musings bring a load of new people into
business because I make it make more
sense than the shallow business gurus
you see everywhere Beyond goals problems
and potential pasts there are multiple
aspects of the human psyche that
influence how people perceive and act on
goals and problems prior experiences
firm and loose beliefs and skill level
across all domains of life all of the
above can be conscious unconscious known
or unknown your entire job as an
education brand is to raise the
consciousness of your audience make them
conscious of their goals and problems
expose them to unknown potentials of
their life and educate them to the point
of it being known your Niche is the
frame of big goals and burning problems
that compose your worldview your job is
to program the minds of your audience to
adopt this Frame or worldview pursue
those goals and solve those problems
this is a massive yet fulfilling
undertaking to live a life of purpose it
demands that you develop yourself for
life and evolve with the responsibility
of guiding a community under you niches
are supposed to be specific and what is
more specific than this a desirable goal
that will change your life and your
readers a burning problem that will ease
your suffering and your readers a clear
path system or solution to bring you
Clarity and your readers these goals and
problems will almost always be similar
to someone else's everyone has the same
goals and problems in the Eternal
markets which are health wealth
relationships and happiness but the path
the path is singular to you everyone
wants Financial Freedom but two people
have to take different paths to get
there you may go the social media media
and online business route with
e-commerce and the unique skills mindset
and experience associated with that
another may go the investing and real
estate route with another unique
combination of skills and interests
remember that every other interest you
learn also plays a role in how you
perceive situations if journaling going
on a walk or playing video games were
included on that path no matter how
direct to achieving your goal they still
played a role in you achieving your goal
the path is what creates who you are all
of the beliefs skills and billions of
bits of information you process along
the way toward achieving your goals is
the most unique niche in the world if
you can illustrate your path across your
hundreds of posts newsletters products
and interactions that is how you create
a niche of one your job is to document
your life on the internet and let the
rewards of authenticity work their magic
your job is to attract a specific group
of people you do this by writing ideas
in a way that makes sense to you from
your worldview from your point of view
the specific group of people are those
with your same personality that's how
you set yourself up to create a product
for yourself that sells without market
research so now to make this more
practical we're going to create the book
of your life this is going to be treated
as your niche of one this is how you
create your niche of one when you
document your life on the internet you
create your niche of one the mindset and
skill set of your past present and
future self should be Illustrated in a
persuasive manner to attract those with
a similar personality but are a few
steps behind you so you can actually
help them you're going to outline the
structure of a book you would write
about your life this will be used for
pattern recognition and content creation
use this outline to notice ideas as you
consume information also use it as a
Content plan to write newsletters
threads or carousels and short form
posts over the course of 6 to 12 months
that is how long it will take to get
your audience truly familiar with you
with that fill out the book structure
below as if you were writing to those
one to three steps behind you you can
use this book outline along with my
two-hour writer course to write content
that actually leads to readership growth
so first is the book introduction which
is your story because your story is your
brand it is important that you get clear
on what your story is so you can use it
to frame content from a unique angle you
can start almost any writing with a
personal experience that alone makes it
unique and not like the rest of shallow
writing where did you start out what
struggles did you go through what was
the climax of your journey what did you
achieve that is desirable to others what
topics interests or skills helped you
get there so section one of your book is
going to be dedicated to your philosophy
you need to get people on the same Pages
you your philosophy is your answer to
the question how does one live the good
life you must constantly illustrate the
importance of what you believe and do in
a way that leads toward your ideal
future or avoids the enemy of of your
brand describe your ideal future and
lifestyle in detail what goals are you
leading your followers toward describe
the enemy what is the future and
lifestyle you want to avoid like the
plague what are beliefs you have that
others would consider extreme or
offensive that one is incredibly
important that's like if you can nail
that your beliefs that other people
think are extreme or offensive from you
but you think are just normal like me
getting up at 5: or me going on a walk
in the morning or me walking 15,000
steps like it doesn't have to be crazy
extreme it can just be something like
that where other people see it as like
oh you're crazy like they're kind of
joking with you those are the tweets
content Etc that will make your brand
grow more than anything else that's it
that's like the foundation that's life
hack that's content hack 101 what is the
importance of each topic interest or
skill you've learned to help you on the
way towards your ideal lifestyle take
your time with this the outline will be
pretty dang big the answers to these
questions will form the major majority
of your content ideas that lead to a lot
of growth so section two of your book is
education this is how you build
Authority your job is to educate people
on the skills or interests that lead to
your version of The Good Life so what
are those skills or interest literally
teach them the skill or interest and how
you learned it there is only so much
that can be said about this you aren't
creating anything new you are simply
creating a library of information under
your brand that way people can learn
from you don't fall into the Trap of
they can just learn this information
somewhere else online because you have
to assume they don't have the drive to
learn anywhere else and that you have to
give them the information because as we
will discuss in the next section people
remember those who first taught them the
knowledge that is useful to them be that
person for more people section three of
your book is practice you create
step-by-step systems and practices that
your readers can use to get better at
your skills and interests as a bonus
slap your own name on these systems or
processes if you want to create
something like the Eisenhower Matrix for
productivity do it but don't teach that
concept or model take it and create your
own in a way that may get better results
so as an example I've read the book The
Art of impossible or just other books
and in terms of like achieving your
goals I'm going to talk about this in
the next letter it's called the Mastery
method I took that from steps and
systems that other people have used and
I created my own steps and my own
systems and I tested them in my life I
created my own name for the concept so
that people can register it as mine and
label me as the person that taught them
how to get those results from that
step-by-step system Behavior change is
the driver of authority and recognition
when you write your own book with time
on social media you build a brand that
blows past 99% of people lastly let's
talk about the psychology of interests
or how to talk about whatever you want
and still get paid cuz this is a big
problem that I see with a lot of people
since I've started changing the online
business landscape I get this question
almost daily I want to talk about more
of my interests but what if it gets low
engagement or my audience doesn't like
it first understand the separation
between content and product people think
that content is all about promotions
they think they should only write
content that leads to sales and leads
this is just like wrong this is the
worst way to go about it they think they
should Niche down everything they write
about rather than having a specific and
compelling landing page for a product
that establishes a Authority in one go
so you don't have to talk about it all
the time in your content test ideas here
and there for selling your product in
your content then use those ideas to
form the landing page that lives ath
static content forever that you link to
your landing page Etc I see this way too
often all people post are images or
updates of their product or they just
like make a post that's talking about
their product they never show that they
are human they never educate entertain
or inspire you know the things that
people actually follow and show up for
on social media these people they only
sell and nobody follows Company accounts
people follow Educators entertainers and
inspirers Red Bull has a massive
following because they don't have a
single picture of their product on their
Instagram it is all inspirational
content about the lifestyle people are
living because of Red Bull if all you do
is talk about your product that is a
great way to never grow your brand have
engaged readers or see exponential
growth in Revenue a personal brand is
the most potent traffic source for your
business business product or service so
let's start by flipping this on its head
what happens if you only talk about your
skill that makes you money you get low
engagement if your content doesn't get
shared how are you going to grow so that
you have more people to promote to
second is that you don't build trust or
authority stop thinking like you have to
monetize right now and start thinking
that you're going to monetize in 12
months and you'll monetize faster now by
doing so third is that people don't like
you if you ever want to Pivot and sell
something else you won't be able to
you're trapped into whatever Niche you
always sell to people have multiple
interests people can adopt new interests
is shocking I know like people I guess
don't realize in their content that
people can gain some interest in
something new it's like they don't know
that they gained interest in the
interest that they're talking about they
weren't just born with it they learned
about it they were made aware of its
importance and then they tried it in
their life and then they got somewhat
obsessed with it and now it's a part of
who they are this is what you're doing
when you're introducing people to your
interests you're trying to show them the
importance of it and why it impacts
their life this is why I always say
pains and benefits you're not writing
about the topic itself you're writing it
about an idea in a way that implies or
illustrates the pain or benefit of the
interest that you're trying to introduce
them to you can make your interests
interesting so people become interested
in them this is what turns viewers into
fans into super fans someone may follow
you for one interest like how you would
follow follow Dwayne The Rock Johnson
after watching a movie he starred in now
they're a viewer the person following
Dwayne the Rock is a viewer then you
either share another interest of theirs
or get introduced to something new like
how the rock posts about Fitness and
Nutrition now they're a fan then they
discover the beliefs or values that
compose their mindset like how the rock
values gratitude and hard work now
they're a Super Fan like do do you not
see what I'm talking about here it's
like if the rock only talked to he can't
only talk about Fitness you can't only
talk about your one skill it's
impossible you just need to be okay with
talking about the things that make you
you like we talked about in the book
outline that we did and by the way
everyone should include mindset in their
content that is what attracts a broad
audience because it applies to almost
everyone talking about more than one
interest is how you become Irreplaceable
the best personal brands do this without
trying they just post whatever they deem
important to them and attempt to
illustrate that importance to you so
here's how you can begin doing this one
is focus on education adopt the mind of
your past self an absolute beginner how
would they get to where you are now in a
better way two is focus on understanding
zoom out and identify the gaps in your
followers knowledge what do they need to
know to get on the same page as you
three is focus on importance analyze
your life and realize why you do what
you do why do you only have why do you
only have those select skills and
beliefs rather than the millions of
others you could have why did you take
take the path you did over another one
so now let's kind of discuss how to
actually Niche down you need a broad
brand in specific product don't mistake
brand for product your brand and content
is not your product brand is brand
content is content product is product
you're niching down your product so you
may be asking Dan how am I going to sell
anything if I'm not writing anything
related to what I sell first you're
writing about it occasionally just so
people know what you do and two you
don't have a solid understanding of what
marketing actually is here you are
almost never directly talking about the
skill you sell you are talking about how
it will change their life how it will
spark a transformation how it will
bridge the gap between where they are
and their ideal future you are
illustrating the life they want making
them aware of the problem they are
facing and presenting a product as a
solution with that think about niching
down like this your brand is a broad
attractor of similar people your content
is a modality of making people aware of
desirable goals and buring problems in
their life your first and foundational
product is the bridge between those you
don't have to consistently write about
your product because you have something
called a landing page that picks up
where your content left off a landing
page is static digital real estate that
doesn't disappear like content does so
become a mad scientist for a bit map out
a newsletter free guide low ticket
product and high ticket service which is
optional if you are building a large not
Niche audience your newsletters should
all be hosted on a Blog so you can plug
the best ones for interested readers to
read this is important because a
newsletter is technically a landing page
within itself if you're plugging your
products or services and it's a lead
magnet to get on your newsletter if you
allow them to opt in on your blog this
is how I make 99% of my sales and get
99% of my newsletter subscribers I plug
my blogs almost every day under my
social media content and when I write
the newsletters which turn into these
YouTube scripts the promotions are in
there and so people buy and they get on
the email list it's that simple that's
my entire funnel now your free guide
landing page and content educates people
toward becoming customers for your
product this is Catered toward a more
specific problem in your audience than
let's say the newsletter your product
landing page picks up from where you
left off and makes people aware that
they can solve their problem faster that
is how you Niche down you deploy digital
real estate write world viw based
content and consistently guide people
every day toward your newsletter free
guide and product in that order so now
let's talk talk about the evolution of
your Niche brand and products solve your
own problems and sell the solution not
once but forever your brand content and
products will evolve as you reach New
Heights in your life you will be forced
to create new products as the old ones
lose their punch this isn't a bad thing
it actually allows you to sustain and
increase your yearly Revenue I have
launched something new almost every
quarter since I started 4 years ago from
web design and freelancing to marketing
Consulting to a physical productivity
planner to social media growth to
self-improvement to writing to a
business Master Class to short cohorts
to a book and a new software from the
systems I've created that almost nobody
can replicate because their path isn't
the same as mine you have to experiment
and iterate that is the only way you
will prevent brand entropy and not die a
slow death to the nature of social media
you must evolve that's it for this video
I hope it helped a lot of people like
this in the newsletter version so if you
want to be on the newsletter to get
these videos in written form beforehand
