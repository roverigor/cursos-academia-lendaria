the greatest skill of the 21st century
is not email marketing it is not graphic
design it is not web design it is not
artificial intelligence it is not
personal branding it is not videography
or photography or video editing or photo
editing it is the base layer of all of
the skills that I just mentioned so the
greatest skill of the 21st century is
persuasive communication but that
doesn't make sense when I just say
persuasive communication and nobody
really tells you to learn that specific
skill instead they tell you to learn
things like copywriting or marketing or
sales they're all somewhat synonymous
but I want you to understand the
framework the structure of how all of
those things work and how they impact
human psychology because why are we
learning skills in the first place it's
to give value and therefore acquire
value so that exchange between two
individuals means that you have to
understand the other individual if value
is perception and other people can't
perceive what you have to offer as
valuable then you're not going to get
the value that you want to receive and
in most cases that is going to be money
so if you do not know how to persuade or
understand the psychology of the person
you're trying to exchange value with
whether it's in a relationship or just
in business whether you're approaching
someone at a bar or you're approaching
someone in the DMS it's all the same
thing you have cultivated value to offer
you need to persuade the other person to
see that value so that they can give you
the value that you want in return and in
the context that we talk about a lot for
like online writing or becoming a
Creator or starting a onep person
business persuasive communication comes
into play in everything if with your
writing it has to be persuasive if you
want it to be shared if it's not
persuasive it's not going to resonate or
be seen as valuable to other people so
that they exchange the value of them
sharing the content that's what you want
from them when you're posting content
right and when you're posting let's say
a landing page or literally anything
that you post online whether it's a DM
or even a text to a friend or a tweet
that you post or an Instagram post or a
YouTube video or whatever it has to
follow a general persuasive structure
and just as a bonus there is a PDF link
to the PDF in the description that goes
over my 10 commandments of Engagement
that's Commandments and 32 post
structures that you can emulate if you
want to increase the power of your
writing there's no pitch in there
there's no nothing is just download the
PDF use it have it open alongside while
you write content or literally anything
so let let's finally dive in people
don't remember what you say they
remember how you make them feel this is
worth repeating humans are emotional
beings not logical 99% of the population
have not developed themselves to the
point of being free from or in control
of their ego that is the foundation of
capturing and holding attention poking
your reader ego you can feed it or make
them feel good or you can starve it or
make them feel bad if you can take
people on an emotional journey of love
hate excitement deceit calmness and any
other emotion that eventually ends in a
benefit for their life you have mastered
the art of content creation life is
story song is story the universe or
Universe one song architecture music
plant life and everything else follow
the universal principles of highs and
lows creation and destruction growth and
death Etc humans make sense of the world
in stories your job is to use the power
of word to make people feel something
stories mimic the natural highs and lows
of emotion I have an entire chapter
dedicated to the universe which is very
big picture understanding of what truth
is in my book The Art of focus and then
every other chapter that's one of the
primary chapters that helps you frame
business and the the new economy how to
acquire skills how to understand
yourself how to reinvent yourself it all
mimics Universal patterns and once you
understand that you master yourself and
then you can Master the world so if you
want to pre-order the book go to the
first link in the description the
keepsake box is still live and there are
only 2,000 copies of that that we are
printing before the paperback goes out
early next year so if you want to be the
first to read it you get instant access
to the digital version when you do
pre-order the keepsake box so we
understand the importance and kind of
how to persuade by mimicking the
patterns of the universe the highs and
lows the emotions that give people
meaning and feeling in this life because
if you if you're just happy all the time
this is why happiness is kind of a false
metric to pursue is because when you're
happy all the time that's that's not
happiness like you're just kind of stuck
there it's normal equilibrium
homeostasis eventually it balances out
to what is normal or boring so if you're
at this level of Happiness all the time
then your Baseline increases to that and
you are no longer happy so you have to
pursue more and more and more that's all
to say that human understanding is based
on the highs and lows of life and we
need to understand how to bake that into
whatever we write speak or communicate
to another person in Life or business so
as you're scrolling on social media this
is a great way to learn is rather than
consuming information research
information so when you're scrolling try
to understand okay what caught my
attention why am I still reading this
how are they holding my attention try to
pay attention to these 10 Commandments
on the timeline as you were scrolling so
that you can notice them pattern
recognition helps with learning you'll
feel that increase in dopamine you'll be
like oh that's what Dan was talking
about okay I'm going to remember that
and use it in my own content creation or
writing or speaking so there are many
ways to capture attention but I've found
these to be the most replicable and
practical with number eight being the
most potent commandment number one is
number three my Lord number one is
specific numbers using numbers in Your
Hooks headlines or tweets will make
people stop to see what the numbers
relate to these can be in the form of
one statistics like there are 7 billion
people on this Earth two dollar amounts
like Apple's new
$1,175 iPhone has this new feature three
metrics like I sent 322 cold emails or
after 293 days blah blah blah four lists
so seven bad habits that are preventing
you from blah blah blah the more
specific a number is the more it catches
people's attention and if you can't make
a number Super specific like in your
headline or in a hook it's okay don't
stress it there this is only one tactic
of many you're supposed to use these as
tools like in your tool box that you
piece together into something that is
persuasive and attention grabbing so
here's one example and this was actually
a thread that led to a lot of people
joining my masterclass digital economics
when it launched so this is the hook of
a thread how I turn one piece of content
per week into a $ 45,2 se5 a month
creative income and 340,000 followers in
2 hours a day in five simple steps so
you can see the specific numbers
obviously there number two is pattern
interrupts a pattern interrupt is
something that breaks people out of
their normal conditioned patterns if
someone is scrolling on social media and
is used to a lot of political commentary
a well-formatted list tweet will make
them stop their scroll most of the
things in this list of Commandments are
pattern interrupts number three is the
negativity bias the human brain is wired
to notice and pay attention to
negativity like this is why you find
yourself trapped in the comments or on
Reddit just going down this feed of
drama it's because that's what we're
most attracted to it's why we watch
scary movies on Halloween today is
Halloween I'm going to watch a scary
movie there's probably a lot to do with
survival baked into this and us paying
attention to things that threaten our
survival which is usually negative and
since humans survive on a conceptual
level and survive the identity that we
attach to or consider who we are which
we're not an idea but that's what we do
and so once that idea of who we are is
threatened we feel threatened I also
talk about that in my book so if you're
trying to say something positive a lot
of people do this in headlines or
YouTube video titles Etc spin it as a
negative so instead of saying you're
going to achieve great things change it
to you will never hit rock bottom again
the second is a lot more potent because
it's more negative but the message is
the same right this doesn't mean that
you need to change your entire YouTube
video to be absolutely negative it's a
way of catching attention so that people
see the value you have to offer for
something that is overwhelmingly
positive number four is a group call out
so this one's simple is just call out
the specific person that you're talking
to so examples like if you were in your
20s calling all creators coaches and
Freelancers and fathers are a gift to
humankind even if your audience doesn't
fall into the specific group you're are
calling out it will allow them to pick a
side and compare themselves to what you
were saying so in this post I talked
about bodybuilders and even if they
don't consider themselves one it helps
paint a picture of what they can relate
to so the Tweet was a bodybuilder is
happier than the average person when
eating Bland chicken and rice every day
because he is progressing towards a
meaningful goal things that are often
boring and monotonous become enjoyable
when you have a reason to pursue
fulfillment over pleasure if someone
talks about being a father I can still
relate because maybe I'll be one one day
but it's still going to attract more
fathers it's just a better way to
capture attention rather than talking to
everyone but you're not really
alienating anyone right when you Niche
down smart you're not necessarily
alienating people from your Niche
instead you're just making what you say
more potent and Rel
so all of these can be used when you're
actually promoting something like if
you're promoting a product or a service
or something this is one of those things
that is very potent is just calling out
who your product is for number five is
the problem call out so if you're if
you're in digital economics or like in
any of my courses or um just have listen
to anything I talk about relating to
marketing and sales I'm so big on pains
and benefits people always come back to
me and they're like man I really need to
remind myself to just remember pains and
 benefits or problems and
benefits whatever it is because pains
and problems that people are
experiencing when you talk about them it
makes the people aware of them right A
lot of people aren't walking around with
their problems just top of mind they're
distracted they're scrolling on their
phone but if they're not getting
anywhere in life and that's kind of just
lower in their subconscious mind and you
bring it to their conscious mind and you
understand the levels of awareness in
marketing where your job in order to
sell a product or service or make any
kind of money or even catch attention
you have to hit on a problem make people
aware of it make people aware of a
solution make people aware of how that
solution benefits their lives over the
course of either a landing page or a
Year's worth of content or a YouTube
video or whatever it may be until
they're ready to buy your product you
create customers by educating them on
their problems how to solve it and you
providing a better solution or a more
streamlined efficient and aggregated
solution and so here's just an example
by the way all of these tweets that I
listed are very high engaging like these
are tweets that I Cur curated because
they did so well so this is me calling
out a pain point of helping them feel
better you feel terrible because your
subconscious knows that you could be
doing better I actually ended up turning
this into a thread the other day and it
got like 20,000 likes on Twitter which
is pretty dang good for Twitter so that
just goes to show that it does catch
attention and it does work number six is
potential benefit so this is the
opposite where problem is is more potent
because of the negativity bias that we
talked about but potential benefit you
have to create the transfer when you're
selling a transformation you talk about
where they are now and where they're
going to be and then the Curiosity gap
between those two makes them want to
learn more from you on how to achieve
that transformation so uh potential
benefit like in a YouTube video
thumbnail when you have like a before
picture of a fitness transformation and
an after picture of a fitness
transformation those are very attention
grabbing and make people want to click
and watch because they're like okay how
did he achieve that I relate to that I
want that potential benefit I'm going to
watch this video because it's going to
show me how he did it now number seven
seventh commandment of Engagement or
attention capture is social proof so
again social proof is authoritative and
implies an information Gap or a
curiosity Gap when you flex your results
or credentials people automatically
assume that you know more than them they
will take your content more seriously
and read to find the information they
are missing this works a 100 times
better when it's not viewed as a flex
I'm sure we all have that negative
connotation or negative feeling when we
see something on like YouTube where it's
like I made a billion dollars in a day
here's how I did it well that's actually
not that bad but there's ones that are
more like cocky right you can feel it
you know what I'm talking about here so
Justin Welsh in my eyes is the current
king of this of like the humble Flex so
here's a post from him sometimes you
need to ask people to buy your product
if you don't you're missing out on 12x
days simple as that and then you just
has a screenshot of his Revenue with a
thing at the top so you use social proof
to illustrate a point point that you're
trying to make number eight by far the
most important one is confidence and
conviction you can create highly
impactful posts with confidence alone it
allows other aspects of attention
grabbing to fall into place you are
right about everything at this very
point in time in relation to your goals
Visions beliefs values and everything
else that forms your perspective of
reality this is what you're doing when
you're writing or creating content
you're painting a picture of your
perspective and what you believe right
now and if you're so wishy-washy in all
these beliefs and goals and values of
yours then one it's safe to say that
you're not really making any progress
you don't trust yourself and you aren't
taking action in alignment with your
goals but aside from that your job is to
have confidence and convictions in your
beliefs and a credible or clear argument
to back them up if you have to back them
up this is the thing is if you have a
certain perspective and it's not
educated you haven't learned and created
your own philosophy or worldview just
through education of studying smart
people outside of the school through
self-education online and following
leaders and then filtering their ideas
and seeing what is true to you or not
then that's step one you have to do that
like just for General quality of life or
to not be a clone of someone else or of
society everyone is on social media to
be told what to do in a confident way
nobody is secure in their actions
choices and beliefs they are looking for
someone to confirm them with confidence
and give them the clarity to act so this
is a life hack all around is that one
you're uncertain in a lot of things so
are other people like it's okay to be
confident and if you're presented with
uh feedback or an argument that
challenges your worldview and you agree
with it then be okay with that change
it's like boom change it right there
okay I'll do better next time what is
there to do but by like restricting
yourself from saying what you believe
you're restricting yourself from
progress because you're just not certain
in the actions that you're going to take
and you're never going to like fail
forward you're never going to be
confident enough to just go in and make
the mistake and learn right so if you
aren't confident right now in the
beliefs that you have it's going to be
very difficult to become more confident
in the future and actually be able to
learn more so here are some tools you
can use to sound more confident one is
eliminate words that imply uncertainty
two speak in absolutes when possible
three exaggerate your point to add
energy of course do not abuse these for
the sake of Engagement so rather than
saying it may be wise if someone
developed their skill set say it is
crucial that everyone on planet Earth
develops their skill set just by being
confident my words flow clearer and the
writing is more impactful and the thing
here is is like oh what if you're
putting out false information well at
least it's confident to the point of
allowing giving someone else certainty
to act like if I'm just wishy-washy all
day my content isn't doing anything if
I'm angry and I'm exaggerating a point
and I'm being very direct with what I'm
saying then I give people the confidence
in their own lives to go and make
mistakes and learn from them if they
blame me for them making a mistake in
life life then I don't know that's just
like that's just a bad like outlook on
life in general is blaming other people
for the mistakes you made rather than
seeing that you made a mistake and
that's one of the best things you can do
in life so here's an example of me being
confident in what I'm saying the
greatest skill one can develop is
decreasing the time between idea and
execution so this tweet surprisingly got
a lot of controversy because people were
just like that's not the greatest skill
this is the greatest skill and so I
think it's funny that I'm including the
title of this as the greatest skill of
the 21st century because it it's the
point across like I could rant all day
about metaphorical versus literal
interpretation of life and how it'll
change your life in many ways than one
because people read literally and
they're like it just like makes their
brain explode for some reason but if you
interpret metaphorically and understand
the essence of what I'm trying to say
and understand that I'm adding impact by
saying it that way you don't take it
literally you're not like oh this is the
greatest skill so this is the only skill
that I'm going to learn and how do you
even learn that skill decreasing the gap
between idea and execution you get the
point that's the exact thing is getting
the point getting the point will change
your life like Words point to something
they aren't the words themselves so
here's another example which is a bit
more extreme but this one has just
worked time and time again for me
because it's relatable and the people
that get it they get it how to get ahead
of 99% of people go quiet for 3 months
laser in on one big goal self-educate
like mad apply everything you learn fail
as much as possible every month take a
break and have some fun birst of
intensity are how you blow past everyone
else so this brings me a lot of
followers on all platforms when I like
integrate this occasionally I actually
had like that's my most popular video on
YouTube and then right after everyone
just swiped the title and used it to get
millions of views so whatever if if you
want to use the title just do the same
thing how to get ahead of 99% of people
and be unoriginal I'm just kidding it
doesn't really matter that much it's
kind of the name of the game so number
nine is active voice active voice
implies that there is a story it eases
people into what you were saying passive
voice is often boring and gives away the
mini story too early there's no
anticipation that makes people want to
figure out what happened next when
you're practicing writing posts look up
an article on active voice and use it to
edit until you get the hang of it this
also helps with being perceived as
confident number 10 is warnings and
cautionary advice so what should people
be looking out for when they're trying
to achieve something preferably within
your brand or worldview cuz your brand
has goals you're obviously like if
you're selling a product or you have a
service then there's a goal behind that
that you're leading people towards or
else you wouldn't attract followers if
you weren't a leader so can you warn
them about something that they're going
to encounter as they're trying to reach
where you are now so this is best
Illustrated with a tweet that I wrote
that also got a lot of Engagement but I
hit on a high engaging topic like
dopamine and warn them of another Hot
Topic so this sparked a lot of
controversy I'm assuming you can guess
why but let's just read the Tweet be
careful telling people about your goals
it releases dopamine similar to
achieving them skip the instant
gratification go go quiet and build so
if I were to come back and just like
listen to my own advice of when I'm
given feedback from being confident and
refining my worldview what I would say
or what I would go back to rewrite this
tweet as or at least add Nuance to it
would be don't tell people about your
goals tell people about what you're
doing it's like what if you don't tell
people about your goals and then no one
can help you well what I'm saying here
is one you're missing the point what I'm
saying here is that most people tell
people about their goals and then they
do nothing about it they aren't doing
anything so if you tell people about
what you're doing then you can still
work with people people can still help
you etc etc see through the literal
interpretation of words here get the
point so those are the Ten Commandments
and now we need to understand what holds
attention cuz we captured attention now
we need to hold it once the Curiosity
Loop is open the Mind feels committed to
figuring out the rest of the story that
is what holds attention crafting a
compelling story stories are layers of
metaphors Concepts perspectives and
experiences that take people on a
journey people want to understand the
entire story they want to know what came
before during and after any given
argument from capturing attention but I
also want to say here that a story is
also metaphorical a story is not uh I
woke up this morning and then I went to
make coffee and then I got on like it's
not just a string of things what I'm
talking about here is structure
structure versus content in all of this
structure of a story is highs and lows
you're walking people through problem
like think of it like the story where
it's setting problem rising action
climax uh falling action resolution and
you can paint a picture of that that's
what a landing page is a landing page is
a story even if it's just like education
on like oh how to start a copyrighting
business it's all guiding people through
a story with problems benefits Solutions
purpose path priority another chapter in
my book that's a universal principle or
you can think of it as goal what people
want to achieve and uh things associate
CED with that the benefits problem where
people are now and what how it's ruining
their lives and then path in between or
system or plan how are they going to
reach the next step that's a story so
the there's two things you need to
understand about this one is just
structure we aren't in high school
anymore long professional paragraphs
don't matter and reduce readability
especially on X or social media people
log on to that platform to escape the
professional world so how do you improve
the structure of all of your content
first is bullet l so use numbers lists
and other tactics that help you break
apart what you were saying these lists
create a story in themselves second is
line breaks so use LINE breaks whenever
possible but don't just add line breaks
for the sake of it be creative use LINE
breaks to emphasize specific sentences
and help your writing flow three is
starting short and concise so use
shorter sentences or paragraphs at the
start of your content capture attention
with short and Punchy statements then
let loose and get creative with how your
sentences flow four is just break apart
sentences so use parentheses
and M dashes over commas this sentence
is too long open parenthesis until I
make people want to know what are in
these parentheses close parenthesis I
use this all the time in my content and
in my YouTube titles I use parentheses a
lot cuz it's it's okay what's next I
broke it down so it's more readable so
here's an example of all of the above in
a hook most people suck at DMS Hi how
are you please follow back will probably
get you blocked more than it gets
responses let me make DMS easy for you
in seven steps okay I didn't include
parenthesis there but I could have put
in seven steps in parenthesis number two
is novel perspectives this novel
perspectives requires you to get the
bulk of your ideas from long form
newsletters articles podcasts books Etc
or talks short form it's more difficult
to actually create a novel perspective
because it's so short you're not getting
the entire perspective novelty increases
dopamine levels in the the brain and it
brings more clarity to an idea that has
been talked about over and over if
you're getting all of your content from
Twitter while trying to grow on Twitter
you will probably end up with the same
perspective as everyone else metaphors
personal experiences and creating new
Concepts is how you achieve this so I
was reading an article and I learned
about how a glass of water creates an
acre of fog and I'm like that's a unique
perspective how can I tie this into what
I'm doing cuz it had nothing to do with
like mindfulness or business or uh human
potential the things that I talk about
but I wrote this tweet the amount of
water needed to create an acre of fog is
one drinking glass remember this the
next time your mind is fogged with worry
but in reality the problem is as
insignificant as a glass of water
content consumption or research is as
important as creation you need you need
a a research of 100 to create a content
of one so that's how you hold attention
but what creates engagement remember
people don't remember what you say they
remember how you make them feel Alan
Watts may have been an alcoholic in his
later years and died because of it
although in the art of focus Community
someone brought up that that may be a
scop or he thinks it's a scop I could
very well see that so who knows if alen
Watts was actually an alcoholic but
regardless of if he is or not his work
has changed my life for good I'm not
going to eliminate or or restrict myself
from listening to his message just
because he may be a person with values
that don't align with mine when the
message can truly change the way I see
the world this is another thing I mean
I'm similar in a lot of ways there's
like people that I don't really like and
I don't consume their content but this
is a good reminder for all of us that
even the people like that we don't like
their click baity titles or thumbnails
or whatever we're missing out like by
not watching them we're missing out on
so much information that could radically
change our lives if the one idea that
would change our lives was in those
videos and we watched it so Food For
Thought back tal and w is that I may
remember some quotes of his but the
reason I remember them is because of the
clarity they gave me the feeling of
having zero worries in the world when I
want to experience that again I throw on
in Alan watt's lecture you are but a
humble messenger of a life-changing
message so the first thing that creates
engagement is the feelings that come
from education or learning learning
something new or gaining Clarity on some
aspect of your life raises dopamine
levels in the brain you create clarity
through novel perspectives metaphors
stories personal experiences and other
parts of your life that will help others
understand what you're saying speaking
of those things those are actually
elements in our corote system for cortex
the app is not out yet the software is
not done but we're going to
revolutionize writing and creating for
the entire Creator economy by making
this so seamless this entire process
your job is to make sense to a specific
group of people you do this by sharing
how certain topics make sense to you
that's it you read something oh okay I I
get that I like that idea how does it
make sense to me I'm going to share that
with other people simple as that the
second thing that creates engagement is
the feeling that comes from inspiration
inspiration is different from motivation
you're helping people connect the dots
on their own giving them the clarity to
make their own decisions and change
their behavior people feel good when
they think they came up with the answer
themselves but will still attribute that
feeling to you the third thing that
creates engagement is the feeling that
comes with entertainment can you throw
in a joke meme or interesting point of
view when you watch a movie you are
entertained through humor drama
emotional parts of the story and battles
that spark excitement in you
entertainment education and inspiration
are the main goals of your content
that's what you are as a content creator
is a mixture of an Entertainer an
educator and an inspiring person so
that's it for this one I hope you
enjoyed it this one was very practical
but you have to actually practice the
theory so remember the PDF is available
to download in the description also the
art of focus keepsake box or just the
art of focus book in general uh both

the same thing everyone writes everyone
needs to communicate value everyone
wants to do their own thing so if you
want to do that regardless of whether
it's like labeled as a social media
influencer or not just write online if
you want to do that to our writer the
course Link in the description other
