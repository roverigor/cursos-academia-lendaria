you have been copying people since you
were born that's how you learn how to
operate within society and this can lead
you down two different paths the first
is the path of the NPC or the non-player
character if you don't know what an NPC
is it's anyone in a game that is
programmed to execute specific things so
it's not an actual player character that
requires conscious input like you aren't
controlling the character in the game
it's just someone that you interact with
and they have pre-programmed beliefs or
ideas or scripts that they say to you to
allow the conscious individual to play
the game better so the NPC or the
non-player character in real life are
the people that are a slave to their
programming they never question their
beliefs or the thoughts in their head or
just what they're saying they don't
become aware of what they're saying what
they're doing and what kind of impact it
has on their own life and other people's
lives so they don't question their
beliefs and those beliefs are the ones
that were projected onto them and that
they accepted without a fight they never
seek to change the default path of going
to school getting a job and retiring at
65 are the only big goals that they have
they never Branch into the unknown so
their life becomes boring mechanical and
animalistic they never discover new
potentials for their life and even if
they do that just scares them back into
their comfortable whole and so the
second path is the path of the main
character a main character is an
individual with a Clear Vision for the
future self-generated goals to actualize
it and non-negotiable actions they must
take on a daily basis they are aware
that the conventional School career
retirement path leads to the same
mediocre lifestyle that you can just
observe in 99 of the population they
understand that they must take control
of their lives they understand that they
are not entitled to anything they
understand that they must create their
own success whether the odds are for or
against them now before we dive then as
you know solopreneur Sprint starts on

both links in the description if you're
interested in business at least read the
landing page see if it's a fit for you
join if you feel like it or if you don't
you are a perspective vessel in a
subjective reality reality is
perspective and you are a perspective
vessel that can expand and collect New
Perspectives for it like lenses of a
camera for how you perceive the world so
spirituality is a lens that is composed
of some form of a belief system that
shapes how you perceive certain
situations so is Christianity so are
other religious belief systems so are
certain business models and how you
perceive business problems and so are
certain relationship ideologies and
advice they're all lenses from which you
can view situations from and they are
not meant to become Static or a part of
you they are meant to be used and shed
and you are supposed to be a
shapeshifter in reality to be able to
bend it to your will not necessarily
bend it to your will but to be able to
be at one with reality rather than
allowing your expectations to clash with
reality which is what creates negative
emotions inside you the NPC and the main
character move through reality in the
way that they do because of their
perspective and your perspective is
forged through time through conditioning
or programming conditioning equals the
information you process with your mind
repeated over time until those thought
processes are automatic so you think of
conditioning for your mind you think of
conditioning for your body it's
repetition to get stronger and more
efficient at lifting that specific
weight so the more you go through a
certain situation the more you kind of
unconsciously learn how to navigate that
situation right it becomes more normal
to you from what used to be
uncomfortable and then you learn and
eventually your your path the direction
you are heading just becomes more
automatic that's why habit formation is
a great thing if it is intentional and
in alignment with a specific
self-generated goal not a goal that was
assigned to you like going to school
getting a job retiring because then that
will set you on a specific Direction and
then you live life on autopilot because
your programming is set for you to reach
that goal so perspective and identity
are very very closely tied and Joe
dispenza has a saying your personality
creates your personal reality so your
identity or your sense of who you are or
your self-image or your concept of self
they're all synonymous influences three
major things it influences your
perspective or your world view it
influences how you perceive situations
from that perspective and it influences
the choices you make because of both so
your identity and the choices you make
are very closely tied so the NPC
perspective is very narrow and
closed-minded and lasered on a goal that
was projected on them by society and
because of their Average Joe identity
they will be pulled to do the things
that align with that identity so they
will make similar friends they'll change
their external appearance to fit into
whatever kind of Click they feel like
they belong to they consume movies media
and information that reinforces that
identity all of which narrow their mind
through conditioning on specific
problems and potentialities that they
have access to with their awareness or
conscious mind and so for the NPC the
the problems that circulate in the
information that they consume involves
something like paying the bills or not
having enough money to go out and eat or
get food getting a better job or saving
a few bucks here and there for
retirement or getting a girlfriend or
whatever the flavor of the day drama is
in the news like oh are you vaccinated
are you not vaccinated are you this are
you that and so the more you're exposed
close to this information that you
willingly choose to go and consume
shapes how you make choices in the world
so if you are not a successful person it
usually is because you haven't fixed the
foundation filtering the negative
information that goes into your head
getting rid of it and replacing it with
the information that is conducive to a
positive future and pretty much making
success inevitable the most dangerous
threat to society is someone who isn't
reliant on it so from the condition
perspective of the NPC they will
interpret situations and opportunities
in that way so if someone straight up
hands them a business opportunity it's
like hey you can do this like in my case
it's like hey you can start a personal
brand you can talk about your interests
and you can monetize your interest by
solving your own problems many people
the people like that don't watch these
videos and then come to it and they hear
that for the first time they're like it
doesn't it just goes right through their
brain they don't even understand it they
don't know what's going on but if it
does register in their brain and they
sense something that they don't like or
that challenges their identity it
threatens their conceptual survival of
who they are then their mind will flood
with excuses and defense mechanisms that
were programmed into them by the belief
systems that they adopted as their own
where it's like oh but but I feel so
much more secure if I just go and I I go
to these four years of college that's
been the plan the entire time I haven't
even thought of anything outside of it
oh let's what what about getting a job I
want to get a job at this place and then
work there for 40 years and uh just
enjoy life along the two hours I have at
night to myself I want to make the most
of and they they don't want to break out
of that they don't realize that the
magic or the discovery or the zest of
Life comes from the unknown from the
uncertain and you going into that you
exposing yourself to chaos and creating
Clarity from it right that's what
creativity is being in a chaotic State
making sense of it creating order being
okay calming down zooming out Gathering
the pieces and putting them back
together into a tool or resource that
you can use to launch yourself into the
future and so when someone encourages an
NPC to say improve their health because
the benefits are obvious they
attack it with whatever narrative they
have going on in their mind right now
where it's like oh I can't go to the gym
right now I don't have this that another
they they make all the excuses in the
world to fix the foundational problem in
their life or they just completely write
it off and adopt another narrative like
the the fat acceptance stuff or whatever
is going on there it's just all over the
place man it is your job to become aware
of your mental programming and work to
reverse it this is how you become the
main character of your own story and
we're going to talk about this more in
depth in next Sunday's video It's called
The Art of self-architecture I'm proud
of that name changing who you are is
difficult it takes intention and effort
and nobody nobody can do it for you so
let's talk about becoming the main
character through what I call
intelligent imitation because at the
very the very first sentence of this
video was that you have been copying
people since you were born right so what
we need to do is we need to copy or we
need to imitate because that's how you
learn that's how you learn how to do
something you see someone else do it you
try it you practice you get better at it
but you need to do it with a conscious
mind right you need a filter you need
self-reflection so that you aren't
heading in the wrong direction in life
so to begin conditioning your mind for
Success you must set new goals for a
higher quality of life immerse yourself
in the information that will condition A
New Perspective make progress and notice
the positive outcome it has on your life
so start with what matters the most we
keep coming back to this Your Mind Body
Spirit and finances or in business we
bring in the one-person business
philosophy where Mind Body Spirit
finances right solve your own problems
flip it eternal markets in marketing in
business where you find the most burning
profitable problems are health wealth
relationships happiness same exact thing
so you solve your own problems you
create a solution for yourself you sell
the solution to other people in the form
of information or in the form of
coaching freelancing whatever it may be
you build build build stack Resources
with that very low cost business model
that I teach and then you go on to do
whatever you want if you want to start
an e-commerce brand feel free if you
want to start a software feel free if
you want to go and open a gym like I
plan to do in the future feel free you
need resources first though and you need
to become high value by fixing the four
pillars of you so to illustrate an
example of what I mean by identity and
perspective being closely linked we look
at a bodybuilder they are somebody who
values Fitness and they will make
choices that lead to a higher quality of
life because of that because they value
Fitness it's important to them they care
about it they don't just write it off
and adopts something else as to why they
can't fix their health the higher
quality of life is baked in into the
identity because they will eat healthy
they're in pursuit of a goal right and
so they're able to perceive situations
from the lens of that goal so when a
problem comes up where it's like oh
we're going out to eat junk food do I
stay home or am I able to look at the
menu and see if there's healthier food
there so they eat healthier food they
move they're more active and a lot of
the times they will choose to avoid
situations that are detrimental to their
progress and so the same holds true for
someone that values building a business
and you have to understand here that
valuing something or finding importance
in something or being passionate about
something doesn't come from not doing it
you have to start you have to get over
the first hump because then you will
find the reason and when you
self-reflect and you realize oh this
actually made my life better I want to
continue doing this I care about this
now then you're going to continue doing
it so for someone that values a business
they value providing value to others and
in order to do that they have to
increase their own skill they have to
develop themselves and they have to have
a mind that is attractive and able to
actually spark positive behavior change
through business and so the choices they
make in alignment with business lead to
more energy so they have higher output
less Financial stress because they're
making more money and a deeper
satisfaction for from intellectual
development that comes with like writing
or content creation or something like
that because well here's the thing most
people think they should stop trying to
copy imitate or just like emulate
someone else impossible right and now
I've actually talked about this on
Twitter recently about people like
copying my stuff literally word for word
like I'm not being overly dramatic when
I say three to five people a day send me
DMS of other people copying my stuff
like even website design literally
ripping my reels
it's like whatever you aren't going to
make it it doesn't matter you're just
giving more traffic and more money to me
thank you but at the same time it's like
you have to take ideas you have to get
ideas somewhere right you have to be
able to take them in contemplate throw
them into the mix of the chaos in your
head and then come back with something
new and distribute that and so the the
NPC is not aware they're unconscious of
how they are imitating people and that
goes on to create who they are and what
they do in life but the main character
is someone who is conscious or aware of
how they are imitating other people and
what they are doing with that
information are they creating with it
are they doing good with it and they're
able to reflect on their decisions see
what went right or wrong see if they're
heading in the right direction and
correct their path
accordingly finally let's talk about
step one for how to begin this
intelligent imitation process so step
one is to create a perspective that you
can grow into this is by far one of the
most impactful lessons that you can hold
in your mind and use to move throughout
reality think of it like as this
expanding and Contracting thing which
determines your open-mindedness or your
closed-mindedness right open Focus or
narrow Focus stressful or creative and
happy and when when you open your
perspective like the the highest
perspective you can adopt is that of God
or the universe or tail or what
everything this right and so when you
expand either to my my favorite way of
thinking about is you can expand to two
different things that are the most
conducive right right now you can expand
your perspective to your ideal self your
ideal future self or you can expand it
to that of the universe when you attempt
and you become conscious of like okay
I'm facing a problem right now you you
zoom out you open your perspective and
you train your mind to do this so that
you can hold a wider perspective for a
longer period of time because when
you're focused on something a problem
like oh no my girlfriend broke up with
me I'm 16 and I don't have any
perspective and so I'm crying in my room
and then you open it up to that of the
universe and you realize oh okay and a
thousand years from now I'm gonna be
dead nobody's gonna know who I am in one
year from now I'm not gonna care I'm
going to be in a completely different
grade I may even move different state
there are billions of other women on
this Earth that this 16 year old could
go out and try to find especially in
their entire lifespan and this is only
like
in this weird situation in business if
you lose a hundred thousand dollars yeah
that's a problem that sucks but
at the same time What can you do can you
make it back like zoom out and think
these through to yourself seriously
today when you encounter a problem when
you feel stressed or you feel negative
or you feel you have a problem zoom out
first what would your ideal self do or
how would they interpret the situation
so let's say 10 20 years from now how
would you interpret that situation
second that of the universe just zoom
out Beyond everything right stop caring
and see what happens and so to help
understand or practice this further and
grow into the perspective of your ideal
self you want to do it consciously and
you want to ask yourself these questions
so that you can have like anchors so
what does my ideal day look like what do
I want to do as my life's work how do I
want to impact people's lives what do I
want to look and feel like what values
and habits will I have to adopt to bring
those to life and from there practice
putting on your new perspective as you
go about your days so step two 2 of the
intelligent imitation process is to
choose three to five mentors that you
aspire to be like you become what you
consume so consume in accordance with
who you want to become so make this
process Easy by writing down the three
to five names of the people that changed
your perspective what is your favorite
book that you recommend to everyone
write down that author's name who is the
YouTuber podcaster or blogger that you
can't stop watching or reading or even
the social media account where they make
you stop and think like wow how did they
say that so perfectly I want to
articulate myself like that because
that's the thing right nobody else
thinks that everyone watching this video
is thinking of three to five different
people so the the combination and
connection of the ideas that you pull
from each of these three to five mentors
that help shape who you are is going to
be incredibly unique and that is
authentic because the three to five
people are your choice and the
information that you consciously
interpret and pick up and make your own
from them
is your conscious choice and nobody can
replicate that to just make this easy
right re-read the first chapter of your
favorite book and see if it changes your
perspective again step three two
becoming the main character is to become
a mad scientist the good life is a
series of experiments you can't copy it
from someone else you have to try fail
and collect the pieces that make your
individual life great the NPC takes what
was put in front of them the main
character leans into the trial and error
that reflects in nature toward Evolution
and growth so as you're immersing
yourself in the information that you
pick up from your mentors it is wise to
keep the scientific method at the top of
your mind to help with trial and error
and overcoming that the first step is to
research you don't mindlessly consume
content you gather it and apply it to
your goals next is you test don't take
advice or information as law test if it
works for your situation this is called
critical thinking next is experiment
don't be Dogma attic about one method
try different diets business models and
religious ideologies until the truth of
each blurs in the middle then you
discover so you note patterns that get
results in alignment with your goals and
you document you write down what gets
you results this is the valuable
information that you can sell or
leverage or just use in your life and
help other people with when you treat
your life as a project it becomes
profitable when you turn it into a
product and so a personal brand is just
discovering yourself in public and
getting paid for the research that you
do and step four two becoming the main
character is create or be created
because the primary difference between
the NPC and the main character is
creation the NPC is created through
years of conditioning the main character
creates themselves through years of
conscious conditioning they choose their
inputs and nobody escapes conditioning
it's happening all around you this video
is is conditioning you hopefully in a
good way and so the modern world is
create or be created you have to create
yourself or you will be created you have
to create or you will be given something
created to give the choice is yours
