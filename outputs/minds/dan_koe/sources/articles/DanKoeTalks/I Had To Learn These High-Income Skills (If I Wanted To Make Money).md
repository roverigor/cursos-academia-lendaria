my business Journey was simple I tried
everything and failed but as we all know
here failure is a blessing it is a data
point that reveals what can be improved
those that don't fail don't succeed it
just doesn't make sense when you think
about it to expect success without
failure when success only exists from a
reference point of failure if you were
successful since the day you were born
which you were in many ways would you
see it as success or would you see it as
normal life you must set a new goal as a
high Embrace massive failure as a low
and dance through the struggle to marry
the meaningful contrast this brings up
an important point which is
self-reliance rich kids as an example
aren't self-reliant because they didn't
teach themselves to be success is normal
to them so much so that they don't have
new potentials to discover in their life
they don't have that journey to go on
they don't have a goal of making a
thousand dollars a month doing their own
thing and embracing the one emotional
labor that comes along with that and
learning from that and increasing your
emotional tolerance and second just all
of the failures that come along that
that lead to nuanced understanding and
experience that when you achieve that
goal of let's say making a thousand
dollars then the next one that reveals
itself is that the aim of your life it's
what gives you meaning is to
consistently make progress and not all
rich kids are depressed and socially
inept but many many are because they
didn't have a reason to cultivate a
skill set that would allow them to reach
a self-generated goal nobody can teach
you self-reliance otherwise it's not
self-reliance to become self-reliant in
any domain from money to relationships
to health you need the skills that
bridge the gap between where you are and
what you want most people don't know
what they want and even more don't see
where they are as a problem notice the
word need in that paragraph before there
are skills that you need to learn in
order to achieve self-reliance they
aren't optional I repeat these are not
optional skills these are fundamental
and they are something that you should
at least have a big picture
understanding of and learn first so that
when you learn any other skill set or
let's say you want to learn Photoshop
you need to learn the skills that we're
going to talk about in order to maximize
the effects of Photoshop these are the
meta skills that umbrella every other
modern skill that changes every 10 years
that you will learn and these are also
the skills that you should have a big
picture understanding of regardless of
what kind of company or business you are
building if you're building a one-person
business like I recommend then you're
going to have to understand all of them
but even if you're going to hire out
something or eventually hire on a team
you need to understand how to get
results for that business in the first
place I feel like you should have a big
picture understanding of the skills that
you're going to hire for so you can hire
correctly so I failed at seven ish
different business models and the reason
that I failed with them is because I
didn't understand the skills that led to
success with any business model because
business has a specific skill set
attached to it that applies no matter
what technicality you go into like if
you're doing email marketing freelancing
or doing graphic design freelancing or
you're doing something else what is the
glue that makes those business models
work and so once you understand what
we're going to talk about in this video
through your own study I can't give you
I can't give you 50 to 100 hours worth
of information in a 30 minute video it's
not how it works and so once you truly
understand these skills and practice
them and gain experience in them and see
results then you can really make money
whenever you want so let's talk about
the Evergreen skills and to frame this I
am building a software company right now
and I have no idea what I'm doing I have
some idea of what I'm doing but I'm
figuring it out along the way because
hiring for a company and actually
structuring it like a company is
different from one person business or
self employment or freelancing where
it's just you you don't really need
anything crazy for it but when it comes
to hiring and legal compliance and all
this other stuff these are things that
you can learn on the go and that I am
learning on the go and I'm talking to
people and understanding it and starting
to learn but all of the other skills
that make the business work aren't
something that every single person can
figure out and learn just step by step
on the Fly that's the point that's the
perspective I'm trying to paint here is
that there's actually starting and
running a business and then there's what
allows you to make sales and money so
what I'm saying is that the technical
skills that you learn to start a
business are different from the
Evergreen skills that allow you that
require creativity and experience
something that can't be outsourced is
something that must be cultivated those
are the drivers of business success so
the first two skills that we really need
to understand and harp on here is
marketing and sales they require
creativity experience and big picture
understanding of your industry to make
work marketing in sales are the
differentiating factor between those
that make money and those that don't so
let's take a tax startup for example and
why it's always weird saying like why
all I will be so far ahead of other
startups is that most startups or even
just most coders let's take developers
coders programmers as an example where
they're like I'm gonna build an app and
it's like that's awesome I'm gonna make
a billion dollars doing so it's like
okay you're a little delusional there
because you don't understand Marketing
sales you don't have the experience you
don't have distribution so they build an
app they launch it in crickets and then
they can't sustain their life's work
simply because they haven't studied
marketing and sales and have given
attention to the content side of things
because on the internet there's code
content you need both in order to create
product and attract people and all of
that fun stuff so for me when I'm
building a tech startup I'm going to
make a video going over my entire
strategy of how I'm going to make it
work I have three to four million
followers that have built up over the
last four to five years years I have
sold products and services that have
changed the lives of people that I will
sell the product to they understand my
value they understand the power in the
systems that I can offer and me turning
that into a software to make their lives
easier the marketing strategy is already
tested validated laid out for me I
already know it's going to sell because
I made millions of dollars already
selling it in a different medium that
isn't software so as an example I have a
course which took me zero dollars to
create and making millions from it
taking the system from that course and
just turning it into a software which
takes me a bit more money now that I
have it in order to create that so I
already know the software is going to
sell because it's sold before so with
developers or coders they don't have an
audience that trusts them they don't
have promotions that catch the attention
of their target market they don't solve
a specific burning problem they don't
plan to raise problem awareness over
time they don't create their own
customers through content they don't
have any of the Firepower in place that
would allow them to write good content
ads and turn viewers into customers so
with that marketing and sales paired
with writing and speaking is how you
create value marketing and sales are the
psychological kind of Cortex or meta
structure of what you're going to write
or speak so that it is impactful and
persuasive and valuable because
marketing is perception value is
perception so you saying something and
being able to use marketing principles
or psychology to frame what you're
saying to catch attention hold attention
and May make what you're saying valuable
and understandable that is the most
valuable skill because I'm not you're
not on think about this like actually
think it through right I'm not saying
Marketing sales writing and speaking so
you go and start a social media brand
how that is important right that's a
very good thing to practice this thing
on I'm speaking to you here I wrote the
script for this before this but what
about everything else when I'm selling a
course do you think all of that
knowledge just goes out the window and
my curriculum is just a load of an
unorganized mess what about texting or
messaging high-level business people and
getting what I want from them in
exchange for something else a value
exchange what about every single [ __ ]
thing you do because communication is
writing or speaking and if you don't
know how to do that correctly from any
medium even if it's just a software or
selling the software whatever it may be
you need to understand these skills if
you want to see any form of success
because if you want money someone else
has the money that you don't have and
you need to be able to persuade them to
give it to you in exchange for something
valuable that you created called a
product or service and whether that's
just in a social situation where you're
not exchanging for money but you're
exchanging the value you have to offer
packaged up in your head distributed via
words in order to get them to do
whatever you're doing because you're a
survival based creature and you're
manipulating your environment at any
given moment I'm manipulating you guys
right now not in a hopefully negative
way in a positive way Mutual benefit and
that's what you're doing in any
situation I'm tired of saying marketing
speaking writing a sales is are the
skills to learn and then someone else
comes in and they're like oh email email
marketing will make you ten thousand
dollars a month it's like first that's
writing and speaking and marketing and
sales two email marketing is such a
myopic way of viewing the skill set that
comes along with those and you're going
to fail because you think I only have to
learn this specific tactic how to write
emails and land clients in order to make
money when that business model is going
to go to the ground in the next five or
ten years you're not not stacking the
skills that allow you to make money in
any situation because you understand the
root of all being so I'm dragging on
let's summarize the principles of
Marketing sales writing and speaking
first you need a desired outcome and
then you need a burning problem that
stands in the way a proven path to reach
that outcome unique to your experience
the level of awareness of the person you
are targeting how aware are they of
their problem an angle to talk about
that problem based on the eight human
desires a list of benefits and how
solving the problem impacts their life
proof from yourself or previous
customers that you can solve that
problem a big idea that catches
attention in the sea of Internet noise
and a risk reversal or guarantee that
tips them over the edge and so you may
have seen those before like if you study
copywriting or Marketing sales whatever
I've also talked about them in the value
creation video It's called value
creation colon the single skill That
Built My one-person business because all
of those things are like Legos they're
Legos for your writing and speaking so
that you can do it in a a persuasive way
so as I said you're using these skills
whenever you're selling anything selling
is synonymous with exchanging value or
selling what you have to offer and
persuading someone that it is valuable
right you're doing that in any situation
it's not just in exchange for money when
you're talking to a girl or a guy or a
friend you're selling your ideas and
world view so that they want to be with
you so remember how we discuss
self-reliance because the rest is on you
you have to go and study those things
and frame your mind in a way that allows
you to get results this isn't a
marketing and sales course if you want
that get to our writer or digital
economics this video just is to make you
aware of what you actually need to be
studying so next what you need to
understand is the Evergreen vessels so
we talked about the Evergreen skills
which is about communicating value and
getting what you want but most people
fail to make money because they don't
understand how business works you need a
good product which has a host of skills
involved in making and you need people
to send to that product so that they
purchase it and they purchase it because
one you led them to the product with
writing speaking marketing and sales and
when they saw the product that's writing
speaking marketing and sales and when
they got into the product in order to
spark positive behavior change and make
it so they actually use the product
that's writing speaking marketing and
sales so let's run through a scenario I
want to sell a planner so I experiment
on myself first why because you need
experience and results most businesses
fail because they're trying to sell to
people that have a problem they've never
experienced so I buy four to five best
selling planners on Amazon I buy
productivity books and courses I drown
myself in podcast social media accounts
and videos on productivity hacks I
structured my days map out my work and
put what I've learned to work by this
point I have an idea of how to improve
the planner I want to sell or do
something entirely new based on what I
discovered with my research I've also
exposed myself to the entirety of what
makes that business work I've listened
to high performing social media content
that I can recreate to promote my
planner and build a following without
ads I've purchased the planner books and
core courses from people that make a
living from them so I can reverse
engineer their marketing and web pages
I've gotten results so that I have
direct experience of the problem desired
outcome and system to get there which
composes my marketing strategy it's all
right in front of you but you aren't
paying attention if you want to make
money outside of your job you need
distribution and a product if you want
to do it as one person without the
Restriction of a physical location then
you need code and content code is the
back end of the internet content is the
front end of the internet code is how
you host content content is how you
capture attention you don't need to
learn how to code because technology has
advanced to the point where you're at
now what used to take 10 employees to
build a membership site can now be done
by one person who purchases a software
you can hit post on social media have
one big account see that post share it
and get hundreds of thousands of views
without ever posting before you can
build a readership that allows you to do
anything you want with your life you
aren't bound to one static Niche all in
all I'm saying that content is not
optional anymore it was a few years ago
but markets evolve here is a tweet from
cold email Wizard or Daniel Fazio says
sales Cycles are getting longer
prospects are investigating you more
Whoever has the most and best content
will win and specifically long form
content like YouTube videos and podcasts
that allow you to actually prove the
value you have to offer and show that
you are experienced and can get results
and are an expert and can actually make
sense with what you're saying cold email
Wizard or Daniel Fazio he's also on
YouTube good content he's a good dude so
content is how you distribute your
product marketing and sales are how you
create products that are actually valued
by the market those are the main skills
that you need to learn no matter what
else you learn you see where I'm saying
content which is writing and speaking
it's a vessel either visual or written
to distribute the value that you have to
offer that is crafted by marketing and
sales or psychological principles so if
content doesn't make sense to you then
check out to our writer or 70 genius
ideas which is a
free like note taking and journaling
thing but it has a lot of these
principles in there it may help you if
you don't actually want to just buy a
course right now so let's talk about the
modern career path because I like
philosophizing about the future of work
but we see here at the top you have you
or your topics interests and Curiosities
it branches off into code and content so
on the code side you have websites
membership software funnels automation
AI these are like either no code or
something that you can learn to program
then on the content there's writing and
speaking which involves social media
video email design branding those both
Branch into marketing and sales which
are psychology mechanics attention and
awareness and then that pulls you in an
audience and to the audience you sell
the offer and that's where you make
money and that's just like one offer
right there's more you can create a
funnel you can create upsells down sales
offer Stacks cross promoting whatever it
may be we're just focused on like one
offer or make some money then you
already know what to do next so I have
faith in the Creator economy even when
people don't see it I see it as Nature's
Way of correcting what went wrong in the
industrial revolution schooling is
decentralized with content and courses
students can pursue their curiosity and
adapt to the times fast eight hour work
days in wage slavery come to an end for
individuals that self-educate and
acquire skills to work for other
creators and eventually themselves I
mentioned wage slavery there if you
haven't already watched my video on how
to escape wage slavery highly recommend
it so here's the career path for both
the present and the future first code
and content code and media are
permissionless leverage they're The
Leverage behind the newly Rich you can
create software and media that works for
you while you sleep Naval popular I'm
supposed to be a professional forget
that I said popular so most people will
have to start with either code or
content so you either become a
programmer or a Content marketer you can
learn both with time and this is one of
the most potent skill Stacks is both
code and content that's a full stack
Creator the programmer can work for
creators startups and really any modern
job they can freelance or be employed by
all of the above the content marketer
can do the exact same everyone has a
Content Marketing sales or any form of
media team businesses need content
businesses also need programming
depending on the business so that is
where you're going to find jobs and just
work and customers for your business in
the future and now is online on the
internet in the collective Consciousness
where we're documenting our mind and
we're slowly becoming more and more
virtual we're transcending to the mental
plane of existence through the Internet
you may not see it but that's the next
phase of evolution we are automating our
physical bodies to the point of being
able to interact with much less
restriction than we can in the physical
world like even just imagine being able
to read someone else's thoughts like
there's going to be some laws imposed
there but I'm I'm just excited to live
to the point to see if like one this
will actually happen or what will happen
when we solve the hard problem of
Consciousness and can literally hack the
material world with the underlying
fabric that allows
that to be there I wouldn't say material
world but relative world so your
personal brand is your online character
or your online avatar and if you choose
that you don't want to learn to code
that's perfectly fine because all of the
tools available to you you can build a
website you can build membership
dashboard you can use zapier to hook
literally everything together you're
fine so number two marketing and sales
so you go the code or the content route
and then you have to learn both
marketing and sales that's second step
that's fundamental learn to sell learn
to build if you can do both you will be
unstoppable so both pass code and
content will converge into the need to
learn marketing and sales and it's
better to learn them from the start
simply because then you're framing
everything else you learn if you learn
any new skill that will go away in five
to ten years because of how rapidly
technology is evolving but if you learn
a modern skill like graphic design or
email marketing then you're doing so
from the lens of marketing and sales so
that from the get-go the first
iterations of whatever you create is
just more valuable than the person who's
going around and doing absolutely
nothing thinking about how the other
person will perceive it most software
companies and coders fail because they
can build a product but they can't sell
it the same goes for Content creators
they can build an audience with good
writing but when it comes to creating a
product that people actually want they
fall short if you want to survive
outside of a job that inevitably loses
its shine and change you to a paycheck
marketing and sales are your weapons on
the entrepreneurial hunt so step three
is to build distribution build
distribution then build whatever you
want it's a quote from Jack butcher
distribution is the most important
concept you can understand in the
digital race to riches and distribution
methods vary in leverage Freelancers
agencies local businesses and even
startups often focus on low leverage
instantly gratifying distribution
methods like cold email paid ads and
direct messages now these are still
viable methods to acquire customers but
you are often left with nothing if you
stop putting effort into you are better
off building long-term distribution
while mixing the other methods to see
profit quickly so like building an
audience like a 100 000 follower X or
Twitter audience promoting to your
network like having a 100 000 follower
internet friend to promote your network
so not your 100 000 followers but theirs
and renting others audiences like
newsletter or YouTube sponsorships to
get in front of millions of interested
people you must learn social media as
the skill to tap into the global
distribution Network and so as you write
content and build an audience so you
have you're building that high leverage
distribution it takes time so along the
way you can still set aside time to do
the low leverage but quicker results
ones like cold email DMS Etc so for
perspective I get around 12 million
impressions per month on X alone with
other platforms it's probably quadruple
that number and from a Google search I
don't know how accurate this is but a
low CPM is around three dollars for paid
ads which is per 1 1000 Impressions
every month on X or Twitter alone I get
what would cost me thirty six thousand
dollars a month worth of Impressions if
your content and ads are profitable you
should be able to make well over a
hundred thousand dollars from that each
month you see what I'm saying here is
that you can either pay thirty six
thousand dollars a month on ads to get
the same amount of Impressions that I
get after building an audience for three
to four years it's Instant versus long
term but that doesn't invalidate either
one it's do both but aim for the long
term and to stress that point again
that's only from Twitter Twitter is one
of my smallest audiences now so I
probably get 100 to 150 000 worth of AD
spend just from The Impressions that I
get on all social media and if I can't
out make that 150 000 a month in ad
spend then I'm not getting an Roi so
even if I make 150 000 a month with my
own content for free that's bonus but
and since I'm not only nurturing the
audience but them being with me the
entire time and understanding what I
talk about and being more likely to
purchase my products or Services I
should be able to out earn most Roi I
should be able to make three four five
six hundred thousand dollars a month as
one person with the distribution that
continues to grow and grow and grow so
step number four is just the shift from
employable to unemployable because there
comes a point
through experience and skill acquisition
that you just can never become employed
again it's impossible you have too much
of a network to fall back on if you need
an opportunity let's say my business
dies today I message five people I
guarantee I will at least be able to
cover let's say ten to twenty thousand
dollars a month based on my skill set
and how I can help them at least for a
short period of time they can make room
for me simply because I have that
Network and at this point your skills
compound to the point where you know how
to make money in any given environment
or situation no matter where the
market's at right if I know marketing
and sales like truly not the basic udemy
course of oh you need a opt-in page you
need to build an email list you need a
Facebook page with a good bio I'm
talking real marketing and sales a deep
understanding of them all studying them
for one two three years with practice
along the way and experience in trying
to get results and failing multiple
times with that
I can spin up an offer figure out a
distribution Channel and launch it
within two weeks and make however much
money I want depending on the methods
that I choose so the progression that I
would follow is this is start learning
the skills that all brands need
Marketing sales branding content design
social media Etc apply for jobs or work
for a Creator to get real world
experience and earn some money this can
be freelance or employment you're gonna
have to reach out to people and talk to
people online oh no dedicate one hour
minimum each day to building your own
thing write content iterate until you
are growing and promote your offer as
your audience grows start to transition
into doing your own thing expand your
product stack to Target more people in
your audience this way you're making it
near impossible to not secure your
future and if you have subpar marketing
skills a good audience can still make up
for that you can't do that with ads
because writing the ad itself is
marketing and sales right you're gonna
have to have all of that in place with
an audience people just trust you and
they like your thoughts and they're like
oh this guy has a product I'm gonna buy
marketing and sales is like a little
boost to that so the fifth Point here is
just iterative products because most
creators fail because they treat
monetization as a one and done type of
deal your products and services evolve
as you do they build off of each other
you can't create a better product if you
never launch the first stagnation equals
Death my web design service evolved into
funnels my funnel knowledge evolved into
three digital products those digital
products evolved into a community my
experience along the way created two
more digital products my 10 plus lead
magnets evolved into a planner which is
now being relaunched with my book in
late September all of the above are
evolving into the software that I'm
building it never ends that's what makes
it meaningful it should be obvious that
if something isn't selling you have a
product or service like freelance or
just a course or something and it isn't
selling it's your problem it's not the
markets if you kept learning and
refining your skill set beyond that you
would see the opportunity to improve
your products all of this business stuff
is just persistence and iteration for
life and that is it for this video I
hope you enjoyed it to our writer if you
want to learn high impact digital
writing digital economics if you want to
productize yourself or turn yourself
into the business both of those are in
