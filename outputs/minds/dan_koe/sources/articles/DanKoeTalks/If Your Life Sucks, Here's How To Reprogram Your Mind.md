I think often about one of the darkest
periods of my life the funny thing is at
the time I didn't know it was one of the
darkest periods it was just a normal
phase of my life it was my standard and
my good days then are my terrible days
now so many people have no idea how much
better they could feel they don't
realize that their normal state is
bottom of the barrel I would start my
days at 10 a.m. I would drive straight
to the McDonald's grab two sausage and
Egg McMuffins and a large iced coffee
with cream sugar all of it I would
instantly feel like garbage and I would
just lay back down and binge watch
episodes of the office and I did that
until I got hungry again and then I
would either go somewhere to eat and
just eat way too much food again or I'd
cook at home and just again eat way too
much food again like frozen burritos and
all of the stuff where it just doesn't
require any effort to make and this was
in college I was taking online classes
at the time and I just didn't know how
to manage myself I saw the freedom of
online classes as an excuse to adopt
self-destructive habits I barely did any
of my schoolwork and I would log on last
minute to just complete the assignments
and I still passed with A and B's so
that says a lot about the education
system at night I would spend 5 to 7
hours playing League of Legends and this
was with or without friends and at this
point I was just numbing my mind to
escape the whatever I was hiding from
and this is all to illustrate one point
the difference between video games in
real life is fake risk and real risk
real pain real fear real sacrifice the
things that allow pleasure love and
results to exist in a video game you can
fail without repercussion you can die
and you respawn in life you can't just
hide behind your screen and hope that
there won't be any kind of failure that
is necessary to grow in a video game we
trick our minds into thinking that we're
making progress we increase our level we
acquire skills we acquire traits we
unlock certain things like dungeon
and new quests and it triggers the
reward system in our brain and we start
to enjoy the comfort and security of
diving into the fake unknown in a video
game to give us that false reward and
it's just all backwards I was doing this
same thing in my life I was hiding from
the necessary failure and pushing into
the unknown that will bring true
progress and reward into my life I had
to get my reward from something
external I had to get my reward from
video games and food rather than
pursuing my goals and making progress
the sleeping in fast food and Netflix
binges kept me in a drip fed dopamine
sedation so that I didn't feel the need
to pursue anything greater everything
was fine because I let it be fine my
life sucked because I let it suck before
we begin I am once again asking you to
pre-order my new book The Art of focus
it's more than just a book it comes in a
keepsake box the price actually will
increase inrease in 2 days and there's
only 2,000 total copies available uh 25%

video goes out there's only 2 days and I
upload weekly so this is the final
update you're actually going to see on
YouTube before the price actually
increases so go and click the first link
in the description to actually check out
what's inside you don't have to buy

reader and of course the annual event
the future of work event with total of
five to six speakers that we already
have that's going to happen in Q3 of
2024 and all Keepsake holders the people
that purchase the Box get a private
invitation to that let's get back into
it your life sucks because of the
thousands of tiny choices you made over
the past year you didn't make the
choices that led to a purposeful career
you didn't make the choices that led to
fulfilling relationships you didn't make
the choices that led to a healthy and
aesthetic body but Dan what about my
genetics and where I was born and the
job that doesn't give me the time to
blah blah blah blah blah yeah those
things obviously play a role but you
just made another choice to close your
mind off to the potential choice that
you could make to slowly get yourself
out of that situation so that you can
free up more time or move environments
or whatever to make better choices
choices come after choices you don't
just make the choice to quit your job
without making the prior choices that
allow you to do that the ability to
choose can be taken away or even given
away it can only be forgotten that is a
quote from Greg Macau from his book
essentialism it's not difficult to look
around and see that you're not a special
case there are thousands of individuals
if not hundreds of thousands or millions
that were in a relatively similar
situation as you that made the choices
that allowed them to get out of that
situation what I'm saying is is that
there is a way out of whatever it is if
your business isn't growing that's your
fault you haven't zoomed out or
developed the mental capacity or skill
to be able to even register what the
problem is in your business so that you
can solve that problem and let it
continue growing same goes with your
relationships or just your life
situation in general you have to push
into the unknown in order to discover
the skill mindset or whatever that
allows you to then from a higher level
of mind come back to that situation and
solve the problem the quote from
Einstein you cannot solve a problem from
the same mind that created it so
increasing your mental capacity comes
first increasing your mental capacity
comes from pushing into the unknown
cultivating new skills understanding new
knowledge and getting out of the known
the comfortable routine and cycle that
you have dug yourself into the quality
of your life one year from now will
depend on the tiny choices that compound
into that life you don't have to make
perfect choices it's actually better if
you make mistakes the greatest risk is
no risk at all because how else would
you fail without failure Improvement is
is literally impossible without
Improvement you don't have an aim for
your life without an aim for your life
everything becomes meaningless becoming
a better person is how you live with
purpose that was about tiny choices and
now we need to understand big standards
broke people are okay with being broke
until something catastrophic happens and
it is much more likely for a
catastrophic event to happen to them
their car blows up because it's old and
unmaintained someone breaks into their
house or their car because they live in
a bad neighborhood their parents get
sick and they can't help because they
have a low income and of course they you
have the motivation to make money at
this point when something catastrophic
happens but most people think it's too
late when the catastrophic event
actually happens so they don't do
anything about it and then they just
wait for the next catastrophic event
they didn't prepare they didn't have the
foresight or vision for that
catastrophic event they couldn't break
out of the narrow mind that they have
adopted because of the narrow routine
that they are stuck in so they get
trapped in an infinite cycle of I should
have started sooner and eventually
things equalize right so they the the
event happens like someone breaks into
their car and then the stress slowly
comes down and then it becomes normal
and then they're comfortable again and
it's like I don't have to do anything I
feel just fine my survival isn't at
stake and they just wait for another one
to happen they don't do anything to
prevent it they don't do anything to
reverse entropy successful people use
these events to change who they are and
who they are determines their standards
and values and their standards and
values determine the tiny choices that
they make if you're okay with having $5
in your bank account you won't see that
as a problem if you're okay with having
$100,000 in your bank account you will
see anything less than that as a problem
that needs to be fixed problems frame
your perception I have an entire chapter
on this in my book when your mind is
open and has the intelligent limitations
or the standards that allow you to
create smart problems that require
creativity then you begin to notice more
let's say money-making opportunities in
these situations where if you have $5 in
your bank account you don't see that as
a problem right so you're not going to
notice any opportunities that help fix
that because it's not on your mind it's
not framing your perception and when you
are not okay with anything less than
$100,000 then even if you have $50,000
your survival is at stake you're going
to see that as a problem it's going to
break bring a you stress to your life
which is a good kind of stress and then
things the universe starts to conspire
in your favor but this is just like The
Logical outcome of having a problem on
your mind that you want to solve
creatively you start absorbing
information without even really being
aware of it your Google searches change
to things like how to make an extra
$1,000 a month you start having
conversations about money with your
friends all of these tiny choices begin
to compound into results you rewire your
thinking patterns based Bas on your
intentional search for specific
information relating to the problem you
are facing the information you consume
highly influences your identity and thus
your standards so if you are in let's
say a social media space or you're
reading books or you're immers your
conditioning programming training your
mind like I talk about in the video
about mental bodybuilding you're slowly
allowing these standards to form over
time if you're surrounded by a group of
Internet Hustlers no matter what you
think of them that keep saying oh you
need to make this much a month to be
successful there's goods and bads about
that but if you adopt that as a standard
the likelihood of you actually reaching
that point is a thousand times higher
than someone who does not have that
standard in their mind they're just not
receiving and storing and memorizing and
being able to use the information that
crosses their mind they just get stuck
in this cycle of
scrolling all day long if you surround
yourself with people physical or digital
that make it seem like it's okay to be
100 lb overweight have zero money work a
job you hate stay stay with a partner
you despise get drunk every night and
the rest how do you think your life will
end up if your standards require you to
eat from Whole Foods you are going to
look at McDonald's in disgust if you
don't then those aren't hard standards
in your head and this is also how
standards intertwine with identity a
bodybuilder is naturally going to
gravitate towards certain types of food
and see other Foods as disgusting and
the only way a bodybuilder becomes a
bodybuilder is through the education
pushing into the known seeing progress
in progress in the practice of
bodybuilding and adopting the actions
that are necessary to become one and the
standards to become one or else they
don't get results and this is in more
than just bodybuilding if you're not
interested in bodybuilding okay whatever
if you're interested in making money or
changing your life then you're
interested in adopting the identity of
the person that is going to reach that
ideal future if your standards require
you to work like a CEO you will see
low-level gruntwork as a problem that
needs to be outsourced or automated or
taken over by a software this explains
the majority of like Ai and automation
coming into take away those jobs it's
because the people with those jobs don't
have the standards that allow them to
bridge their understanding and action to
a higher identity now you obviously
can't solve all of the problems in your
life immediately you can't escape your
situation right now you need a plan you
need an aim and by sticking to this plan
I can promise that the journey will be
more enjoyable than the outcome of that
thing as nche would say happiness is the
feeling that power increases that
resistance is being overcome so now tiny
choices and big standards we've covered
those and how they connect with each
other now a good way to adopt higher
standards is to adopt the standards of
the person you want to become or the
ideal version of yourself most people
take the bare minimum approach to life
quick money quick sex quick pleasure no
commitment no depth no failure the
easier you try to make your life the
harder it's going to be the way out of
mindless living is to adopt the
standards of who you want to become how
much money do you want to make what kind
of work will bring you fulfillment what
is your ideal relationship for friends
or a partner how do you want to look and
feel you must go beyond the bare minimum
of survival commit to having a reason
behind your actions if you don't know
why you're doing something why are you
doing it and if you do know why why are
you ignoring it are you advancing
Humanity by handing out 40 quadruple
pumped caramel macchiato at Starbucks or
are you making Humanity sick and
overweight why haven't you begun
pursuing a more purposeful career or
starting a business do you know why you
are putting that food in your mouth are
you aware of it do you understand how
each nutrient interacts and creates a
healthy state in your body why haven't
you begun educating yourself on
nutrition and training if you live in
your body it should be your full-time
job to learn about it do you know why
you're going going through the motions
with a partner that was easy to get with
do you see yourself with them for 40
more years why haven't you improved your
social skills and your personal
development to the point of being able
to attract a better partner because in
this case most people just become what's
I don't even what's the word incel they
become an incel because as what we
talked about earlier they don't see the
tiny choices that they can make to reach
an ideal outcome and then as I said
earlier they close their mind off and
that's the choice they decide to make
it's cliche but you only have one shot
at the Thing Called Life the only person
that can stop you from living a
meaningless existence is yourself let's
break down what creates better choices
learning is the fundamental human drive
at Birth you are an information sponge
your parents friends Society teachers
and bosses all project their world viiew
on you where did they get their
worldview from the same people unless
they question it they got it from their
parents friends Society teachers and
bosses this is all that you know when
you reach the age of let's say 12 to 18
and if we could put a number on it you
know less than 1% of the information
available in the world I would even say
it's less than
0.1% and that is the same .1% that every
single other person knows because it was
passed down by every single other person
that's what the Matrix is it's a web of
expectations and those web of
expectations create your identity which
is the same as everyone else and they
get locked in into the same routines the
same Cycles they get locked into the
known and they become slaves to it your
ident limits what information you notice
because you've only learned so much you
won't notice certain things if you
haven't learned the information that
Bridges what it is with what you know
you won't understand intermediate
information if you haven't learned
beginner information you can't advance
from level one to three you are missing
out on 99% of life for this reason it's
because oh I don't want to do that thing
when it's the exact thing that will lead
to you doing what you want if I was
exposed to the environment and
information that made me a a goth I
would notice certain likes and dislikes
in music People clothing work
opportunities outlooks on the future and
I would have a a a certain cycle of
emotional states that I go through if I
drown myself in information that would
lead to the identity that I want over
time I would spot opportunities related
to that identity this brings up the
power of the internet you can tend a
digital Garden or be thrust into a
digital swamp we've never had access to
so much information
and I find it hard to believe that it
isn't creating identities for the worse
and very rapidly when you log on to
social media the default action is to
follow entertainment and meme accounts
rather than value creators almost all of
them subject your mind to unwanted
tenants that party like it's a frat
house when the parents come down they're
devastated by what they see your
awareness is the parents coming down to
see the swamp that you've created in
your mind become aware of this now one
unfollow anyone who does not serve the
conditioning of better standards in your
life even if it doesn't seem like it and
no matter how much you justify it the
people you follow suddenly influence
your actions slowly then all at once you
become someone you may hate two take
your time to follow valuable accounts
valuable accounts challenge your
worldview make you think outside the box
and educate you on the skills necessary
to reach a higher quality of life this
is not an overnight process again you
may not find the information useful at
first it takes time time to bridge
specific ideas that lead to
understanding you will probably find it
boring until it's one of the most
interesting things in the world follow
One account let the algorithm do its
work follow accounts that reply to the
first accounts post with time you will
create an environment that is conducive
to your growth the only difference
between you and the person more
successful than you is the consistent
intention behind the information they
consume but what about taking action
you're acting every day why because your
mind is programmed with the information
conducive to those actions your identity
is forged by the information you've been
fed and that alone determines what you
perceive as an opportunity to act
surround yourself with the right people
and you can achieve anything you want
now let's talk about becoming a value
Creator or the path of the value Creator
which I've done in two videos the most
recent one is the value Creator
something something something why do
people keep doing things they hate I've
always wondered this not like I'm a
special Little Flower that never got
stuck in that trap but one who feels
like he's a escaped and can view the
situation from a higher place on the
mountain until he inevitably falls back
down after crossing the peak praying for
the weekend dreading Monday morning
hiding who you are to make conversation
with people you don't like working with
using the internet as an escape
scrolling clicking shutting your mind
off for just a bit longer because when
it's on you don't like what it's doing
this is the life of the consumer the
person who is used by the internet
rather than the one who uses it there's
no escaping this new world you can fight
with with it or flow with it and while
the internet is a big problem it's also
the solution you do not have to use the
internet to do this but I don't see a
reason not to every time someone emails
me and it's like oh I want to do this
but do I have to do it on social media
like isn't social media bad for your
mind and it's like yes if you let it be
if you can't control yourself and the
people you follow other than that it's
like just the greatest way to make
friends in the world like I I it doesn't
make sense it's like it's like saying
that social media and subjecting your
mind to those bad experiences is like
going to a bar and acting like you have
to stay there because you don't like the
people like you're free to go to a bar
at any time but on social media you can
go to a bar on the other side of the
world the last reason your life sucks is
because you don't contribute to humanity
you don't contribute to humanity because
you don't have something so valuable
that you can't help but share it you
don't have something valuable to offer
because you are ignoring the problems in
your life that beg a solution to be
created you IGN ignoring the problems in
your life because you don't have Clarity
on how to achieve the goal that will
solve them you don't have Clarity on how
to achieve a goal because you have
nothing to build nothing to frame and
guide your learning A value Creator is
someone who has intention behind their
inputs and outputs they treat their life
like a science project and it it's funny
that like I'm writing this and it's
crazy how I've conditioned my mind to
think in my book because everything that
we're listing here is like chapter by
chapter it's kind of a summary of what's
inside the book really like your science
project building something how to learn
it's all in there so they treat their
life like a science project and they
identify problems in their life they
educate themselves with the infinite
resources available to them on the
Internet they test the solution on
themselves and distribute their
experiences with writing if you want to
learn writing go watch the digital
writer series or the oneperson business
series playlist they package up the most
helpful and streamlined Solutions in the
form of a product or service that is how
they make a living by living with
purpose becoming a Creator is the cure
for overc consumption writing is the
vessel for Distributing value I write on
all platforms I don't care to compete
with designs or images YouTube is the
only place that I actually have videos
aside from the animations but I rarely
do those anymore and this is just a
written script it's all writing I just
stand up here and talk and go over the
points of my script I gain a deep sense
of fulfillment by using the internet as
a place to curate good thoughts but to
organize and share them with others with
the ultimate upside of doing what I
enjoy joy to make a living something
that's in my control this isn't about
becoming famous this isn't about
building a mass of following although
those things can happen this is about
Distributing the value you have to offer
in a place that can reach anyone with
the opportunities that will change your
life and career you don't need a
step-by-step course to join the online
party write what you want to write talk
to who you want to talk to get your name
in front of people by not being a ghost
get eyes on your writing so it can
spread more with time I just talked
about that in the last video how to grow
how to actually grow on social media if
you really need the extra push just look
at the people that you have followed for
a long time observe what they write
about observe how they write it observe
who they interact with observe what they
sell to make a living piece the dots
together and begin emulating them if you
don't have an answer look it up you
won't get all of the answers in an
instant be okay with that if you know
you are meant for more start acting like
it you don't have to write but I've
tried it all with writing being the
fundamental mode of communication that
has survived throughout human existence
it's a great starting point to discover
what you truly want to do enjoy the rest
of your week my friends Link in the
description for the art of focus box
