my friends the time is almost here it
actually may be here by the time you
watch this video but the art of focus
box Keepsake Edition is going to be
available for pre-order very soon so if
you're interested in that it's just this
is the only way you're going to get the
hard cover copy along with the bonuses
that are inside the Box itself it's a
pretty big box with a bunch of other
things in there and then we're launching
the paperback after so if you're not
interested in the box that also comes
with a hint private invitation to annual
events only for Keepsake holders to
potentially get it signed if you want to
come or just we're probably going to hit
the gym we're going to do some cool
stuff together in real life in person
and finally get to meet so that would be
sick but either way I won't shamelessly
promote for too long you can check the
first link in the bio and let's just get
into the video so in this video we are
going to start the digital writer series
so we've had the one person business
series we've had the lifestyle design
it's just a playlist on YouTube to be
honest where I'm going to start filling
it with videos on being a digital writer
of course spaced out with other harsh
truths and rants about self-improvement
and other things like that but I want to
start talking about this because it's
very helpful and writing has changed my
life for the better and if you're
interested in the onep person business
then you're interested in writing
because as we'll see in this video
writing is the foundation of everything
to get into it I always been a creative
at heart I wanted to achieve the dream
lifestyle that most people had or that
you just saw on TV or the internet where
everyone's on the beach working from
their laptop or just not working at all
and you're like okay how do I do what
they do or I would also see artists and
graphic designers and web designers and
I'm like I could actually see myself
doing that as a job or I could see
myself doing that as a way to get out of
a job because that's what it seemed like
the people I was following were doing
right that just may be me the people
that I was following and I was
conditioning myself to eventually do
that or want to do that but it seemed
like a way out it seemed like a good way
of living just being able to do
something creative from my laptop from
anywhere in the world so naturally I
studied things like graphic design film
Photoshop illustrator Premiere video
editing all of that stuff and I also
knew that I had to learn something a
skill that was valued by the market but
I didn't want to give up my Creative
Edge and so this is when I took web
development class in my fourth year of
college and it's safe to say that I
became obsessed I went to the first
class I went to the second class I
started learning on my own and studying
because I didn't really understand the
curriculum and then things started to
click and I'm like this is really cool
I'm actually pretty good at this as a
beginner and so after school I would go
to the library and I would just
self-study all day long I would buy
courses I would go on free code Camp I
would watch YouTube videos and I would
just learn to code and code along with
the tutorials day in day out for like 6
hours a day after school the other thing
here is that the tech industry or just
coding in general had the promise of
getting a job without a degree and so
this enticed me and the other thing that
enticed me is that if I went into
front-end web development so what you
see on the internet that wouldn't take
away my Creative Edge and so I'm like I
found it this is the one thing that
allows me to both be creative earn a
high income and potentially freelance or
build a software there was so many
different opportunities that were
opening to me that it just made sense to
learn this skill I have always wanted to
do my own thing I don't know what caused
it maybe it was just my childhood but i'
that's all I've wanted to do I wanted to
do my own thing I wanted to be an
entrepreneur I wanted to be a Creator I
wanted to be what I am now and that's
what led to me being it and along with
this that meant that getting a job was
the bane of my existence it wasn't
difficult to observe society and just
see that many people weren't happy with
where they are they were Mis miserable
and when I say miserable I mean their
life is so dull it's so flat and
predictable and Mindless where they may
not be miserable they may be happy in
some cases but they aren't experiencing
the high highs and low lows that that
contrast that actually brings meaning to
life that alone is miserable it's a
dangerous trap to fall in because you
don't think you're miserable you're
comfortable but you are so much more
miserable than the people that look
miserable in the low lows but that is
what allows them to have the high highs
you can't have a high high without a low
low just it's just a universal principle
when you pluck a string Bing it goes up
and it goes down but if you don't pluck
the string if you don't add risk or
stress or throw yourself into the
unknown that event that traumatic event
that causes growth then you're not going
to live a meaningful life and it's it's
everywhere this principle is everywhere
in music the highs the lows the chorus
the melody the universe universe one
song every everything happening in
harmony the lows that are supposed to be
there and the subsequent highs or the
climaxes of a story it's everywhere
games stories everything you see is
pointing at meaning and that dull
robotic mechanical mediocre existence is
not meaningful long story short I was
never able to monetize my creative
ability and it wasn't because I wasn't
skilled enough I had the skill in
graphic design coding the creative stuff
but I didn't have the skill stack that
made that thing monetizable I didn't
shift my focus because everyone tells
you to focus on one thing oh just focus
on coding and you'll do absolutely
amazing no if you don't learn Marketing
sales writing speaking the Evergreen
skills that I talk about then you're not
going to see your own success with that
thing there are specific Evergreen
skills that you have to learn in order
to build your own thing and so because
of this I had to swallow my pride and
get a job at some point I'll go over my
full story in a few videos from now like
complete breakdown of everything that's
happened in my life especially related
to business but I fail that so many
different we're skipping like five six
years here where I'm failing failing
failing at multiple different creative
Endeavors and it finally not working to
the point of me giving up and being like
I have to get a job just in order to
survive the lesson here is that you
don't need to go to school to get a
high-paying job but that job can be used
as a Launchpad for building your own
thing cuz I talk about jobs a lot
but I'm I'm not against them I had one I
see them for what they are and what they
are as a stepping stone because if
anything is more robotic and mechanical
and Mindless and unmeaningful than a job
it's a job that didn't make sense but
you get the point you have you're either
going to have to break out eventually to
live that uncertain and chaotic life
that brings meaning or you're going to
be stuck in the job and slowly making
progress up this corporate ladder that
others assign to you so let's get into
the topic of the video because I love
just running on and ranting and not
making any sense but we're here to learn
how to make $1 million as a writer per
year so I worked at a web design agency
that's the job I got for a year and this
was a blessing to me because it showed
me exactly what was missing in my
previous freelancing businesses the
agency that I worked for had a marketing
department a sales department and
operations department and then the
creative the the designer so marketing
and sales got the customers operations
did whatever they do and gave them to me
so then I could create something for
them so I realized okay for my freelance
one person business I have to become all
of those things I have to be the media
company I have to be the marketing
department I have to be the sales
department I have to be the operations
department but there is technology and
software now that has allowed one person
to do that well social media is for your
marketing and sales to attract clients
then there's software like cartra or
even clickfunnels or some crms that
allow you to manage those project
management softwares as well so the
whole thing about building your own
thing is you need technical knoow and
you need the creative skill and match
the two together in order to make it
work so this led to me learning skills
like copywriting Sales Direct response
marketing and all the other skills that
people tell you to learn but nobody
actually learns because they're so
focused on learning the creative skills
and not doing anything that actually
generates customers so you can build
your website all day but if you don't
know how to send people to that website
it doesn't matter and then
there's always the objection of oh I
don't want to learn those things I just
want to do design well think bigger like
zoom out and think what do you actually
want in your future do you want that
because if you want that then you want
to do the things that are going to take
you there otherwise you're just thinking
too small and lying to yourself because
then that's when your mind gravitates to
the surface level pleasures and
distractions that you succumb to and
then you get absolutely nowhere which do
you not want more so at my job I would
spend all of my free time trying to land
clients because I knew that was the key
that I was missing so I tried everything
under the sun like cold email cold calls
cold DMS Facebook group networking paid
Facebook and Google ads walking into
local businesses and talking to the
manager and writing down the phone
numbers of service businesses from their
vehicle graphics so like when a car
would pass me and I'd see the vehicle
graphic and it's like call this number
for pest control or to get your glass
replaced I would literally write it down
or take a picture then I would email
them or call them later and I started
Landing a few clients and eventually
referral started to kick in and over the
coming months I started to see some
results and things started to flow a lot
smoothly and I started making good money
money but it wasn't as much as I wanted
and don't get me wrong this allowed me
to replace my income and quit my job but
I didn't just want to replace my income
because at this time I was getting close
to the glorified $100,000 a year mark
but a few things happened at this point
and they could only happen at this point
why because I wouldn't understand them
without my prior experiences or failures
the first thing is I began to understand
the power of social media a huge problem
in my business is just Why was I doing
so much manual work to land clients that
was taking me more time than the actual
client work why didn't I realize that
posting content and building a Following
over time and understanding social media
allowed me to have unlimited clients at
my fingertips think about it like I
don't even need the audience if I can
write a post that is good and persuasive
and plugs my product or service and then
through networking or even paid growth I
can have someone share that post to
Their audience of let's say 100,000 to a
million people they see they click
through I know how to capture and guide
attention and without me even having an
audience I can generate leads 10 times
faster and easier than just a manual
effort but if I could build an audience
myself over time that would save me 10
to 20 hours a week just on client
acquisition and then if I built my
following large enough like past 10,000
past 50,000 people then I knew that I
would be able to Pivot out of client
work and that would save me even more
time people ask like popular videos of
mine are the 4-Hour Work Day day and
they're like you don't work that little
and it's like I do because I noticed
what was taking up my time and then used
the thing that is called creativity to
create a solution to the problem so that
it could work less like you call
yourself an entrepreneur but you can't
spot a problem and solve it in your life
the second thing is that I had the
experience to grow on X centuries ago
there was a social media app called
Twitter and I never really cared for it
but for some reason I was scrolling one
day and I saw a post and it was
self-improvement post I've talked about
this story so many times before but in
short I followed one person likeed their
content followed another followed
another like content started showing up
on my feed I started to like Twitter
more and more I saw that this guy was
selling Web Design Services and I'm like
okay why can't I do the same thing if
he's making a full-time income with that
as his way of generating clients for his
freelance services and his products web
design products why can't I do the same
thing so I started emulating their
content structure and posting the ideas
in my head because with my background
now in Marketing sales copyrighting all
that stuff I could notice the patterns
I'm like oh they're using a hook in that
piece of content I wasn't reading it
like a consumer I was reading it like a
researcher where I would see the content
and I'd be like that's a hook okay this
is leading people down the page this is
where it delivers value this is the
conclusion or call to action that
actually leads to engagement I'm going
to take these pieces and put my own
thoughts related to my own interest in
them
and it should work for the content side
of things but that's not all there is to
content you need to get eyes on your
content and we'll talk about that in the
next video which is going to be called
how to actually grow on social media
what they don't tell you so in my first
year I gained around 10,000 followers in
my second year that jumped to 50,000 in
my third year another jump to 100,000
then I use my validated ideas to post to
other platforms like Instagram LinkedIn
and YouTube I knew they would get
engagement because I had so much data
from writing on Twitter today 4 years
later I have around 2,800,000 followers
across all platforms so narcissism aside
that is a testament to exponential
growth and consistency the third thing I
realized is that everything pointed to
writing writing on Twitter made me
realize one thing is that I wasn't just
writing on Twitter I was writing emails
newsletters landing pages promotions
video scripts direct messages course
curriculums product material everything
it wasn't too long until I just
considered myself a writer people would
ask me what do you do and I'd be like oh
well I kind of like sell Web Design
Services but I'm also on social media
and have a good amount of followers it
eventually just got too complicated to
the point where I'm like I'm just a
writer right I couldn't box myself in to
Any Given thing because when you
actually tap into and understand what a
content creator is not as a job but as a
way of life of capturing ideas and
distributing the valuable ones to people
like you and then solving your own
problems and selling the solution to the
people like you that have the same
problems it's just like the most natural
business model there is it's much deeper
than oh I just want to be a YouTuber and
and that's the thing I did every single
morning even if I had web designed
clients to like fulfill like that took
an hour or two maybe more like a day but
I was writing every single morning that
was the driver of my business that's
what allowed my business to survive and
so this is how 2hour writer was birthed
and that's my course where I teach my
entire writing ecosystem because
everything you do in business no matter
what it is starts with writing and so
here's the thing is that most writers
that probably clicked on this video if
you're a writer then you'll understand
this if you're not a writer then we're
going to talk about what a writer
actually is most writers try to sell
their services on social media most
writers try to just sell their writing
and they can with something like a paid
blog or newsletter or community but but
that's so limiting writing is both the
traffic mechanism and the means to
create an information product or to
create the education and the marketing
around whatever product you want to sell
even if it's like a physical product
you're still a writer and this is where
writers miss out is they think that they
have to monetize their writing rather
than create a solution to the problems
that they're talking about in their
writing because any good writer knows
that writing starts with a problem and
creates steps and value you to get to a
solution and so when you have that the
topics that you're talking about why
don't you sell a product that the people
that are interested in those interests
are already buying rather than trying to
sell your writing when you know how to
write market and sell you can earn an
income writing about whatever you want
and that's just the thing is that
writers or creatives in general don't
know how to Market and sell the fourth
thing that I realize is that my income
grew with my readership a few years ago
I read a post that said I could make 50
cents to $1 per follower per month and
the caveat here is that this is only
possible with your own product or
service this is not possible with
banking on the algorithm or using
something like AdSense you need to
create an independent source of income
you need to take control of your income
and not rely on the algorithm or AdSense
as your boss like you would a job that
you're that's the complete opposite of
why you're doing this you don't want
another boss just this monolith or megal
whatever the the word is of a
corporation to determine your income
based on your views
and how much you cater to them so this
50 cents to a dollar per follower per
month held true for me to a point from
years one to three I made about $1 per
follower per month so 10,000 then 50,000
then 100,000 per month I made $800,000
in my third year and this past year I
passed my follower account in income
around $3.1 million so far in revenue
generated this year with writing so the
the last year maybe I've just gotten
lazy with how I promote I don't know but
I don't think I could see myself with
2.8 million followers across platforms
making $2.8 million a month then again
that could very well be a limiting
belief so there are a lot of technical
details here but one thing holds true if
you slowly build a decent readership
launch a new product and get 80% of the
things right I find it hard to believe
that you couldn't make a million dollars
like it it just doesn't make sense like
if you have control of the product and
you have control of the traffic and you
are consistently growing the traffic
that is being sent to the product that
bar can go up Forever at a job you
aren't in control of this and you aren't
in control of this you're in between and
you're just being given a set amount the
main trap I see is people playing
short-term money games blasting Their
audience with promotions on a crappy
product and never improving what they
offer this is a huge trap it's just
evolve over time evolve what you write
about diversify platforms create new
products do what you have to do now we
can discuss the principles of monetizing
your writing I don't want to give you
tactics and hacks this is a a very
long-term game this is preferably
something that you're doing for life I
would argue that every single person is
a writer not that you have to label
yourself as a writer but whatever you do
in business you're going to have to
write and you should get good at it
you're going to have to write almost
every single day if not however you
create your schedule but I I I want to
give you the principles to focus on
these will be the main drivers in
monetizing your writing the first is
distribution so choosing a platform
distribution is how you BRD product and
people for writers social media is how
you are going to do that you don't need
to start on a writing platform but why
wouldn't you you don't need to post
pictures of your body you can prioritize
learning and idea generation you don't
need to design Graphics or edit videos
it is a peaceful existence unless you
want to expand in the future so I
recommend X or Twitter as your starting
point and then you can develop and grow
in the future if you want because things
like medium.com or blog sites or even a
newsletter those take time to grow
Twitter to me is the only real short
form writing platform where you don't
have to post pictures you don't have to
do whatever you can tweet multiple times
a day and those serve as those ideas
that you post serve as data for any
other content that you create on any
other platform and in my eyes let's say
you want to become a YouTuber it's
easier to build an audience on something
like X and then move that audience over
to YouTube especially when you have
validated posts that you can then expand
on in YouTube videos and know that
they're going to perform well because
they already got high engagement so the
first lever or principle is distribution
so just having traffic the second is an
offer something to send the traffic to
that's how you monetize an audience and
the thing here is is that beginners tend
to see something like a YouTuber pulling
in big money from AdSense and think
that's the only way to monetize now more
people are coming out and being
transparent about how much they make as
a Creator uh with the the products that
they sell right that's the thing is that
the big people the huge people make a
ton of money with AdSense but if you're
it really depends I've talked to
YouTubers that make like 1,000 a month
5,000 a month 10,000 whatever but if you
want to make a million $10,000 a month
for a channel that has 250k to 500k
subscribers depending on your Niche it's
still not enough and if the thing holds
true where if 50 cents to a dollar per
follower per month then you're wasting a
ton of money rather than having $10,000
a month paid out with AdSense you can
create a product that sells iterate
until it sells and potentially make 250
to 500k per month but if you don't make
it that far let's say you create a
product that is 50% as good as perfect
let's consider the higher end 500k a
month perfect let's say you shoot for
the stars and land on the moon then
you're still making like 50 to 100K a
month rather than 10K a month from
relying on AdSense so in order to create
an offer first just go watch my one
person business playlist watch the best
business model to start in 2023 that'll
go over like offer creation I believe
but here's what I would do first thing
is start a freelance business you don't
have a large following at first so you
do more manual work to land writing
clients for a higher price than
something like a course this allows you
to make an income and you can sell
social media content copywriting emails
Etc just don't offer plain old writing
second is to wean off of manual Outreach
as your audience grows you can leverage
that for landing clients this frees up
time to start creating a product the
third is turn your freelance service
into a product so you can keep
freelancing but having a digital product
course or physical product allows you to
earn without manual labor the fourth is
do whatever you want at this point you
should have the mental and financial
resources to build and monetize whatever
you want enjoy the freedom that a proper
skill stack and experience provides one
last thing is that people create a
product and see Zero results most of the
time first I I'll just give you what to
do one study the people that you already
follow and that you know we selling the
product or service and that it's
actually selling create it take it make
it better under your own name sell
what's already selling stick your hand
in the money that's already flowing
that's how you make money don't try to
be clever don't try to create something
new at least for the first product just
create what you know is going to work
but if you want to take it a step
further then consider enrolling in
digital economics which is my higher
price course that has all of my
monetization systems it goes over all
the Evergreen skills writing speaking
Marketing sales it goes over branding it
goes over literally everything or if you
want something else go watch the video
on value creation it should be called
value creation the skill that built my
one person business the third principle
so we have distribution offer that's how
you make money the third is leverage and
scalability so if you don't prioritize
leverage and scalability you won't be
able to make a million dollars a year or
at least without hating your life
because you're spending so much time on
like freelancing clients like you could
technically go and land $25 to $50,000
clients once you get really good
at what you're doing 5 years down the
line and then land two clients a month
that's just that's a losers game like
that's hard and to me that's not worth
doing especially because I would argue
if you don't like working a job then
you're not going to like client work
because you're not doing your own thing
you're not doing what you really want to
do you're doing projects that are still
assigned to you by a client so the
internet and to the point where it's
developed now with all the resources and
software allows you to build a business
in scale without hiring an insane amount
of employees the software is now your
employee as you are writing and building
you have to continue to evolve the
products that you are creating the
obvious and priority thing to do is to
turn your service like freelancing into
a digital product like a course teaching
the same thing to a more beginner level
audience so if you're selling
copyrighting services to these clients
for $110,000 but you've attracted a
broad audience teaching about
copyrighting then don't turn the
freelance product into something that is
targeted at something super Niche just
create a basic copyrighting course teach
people the basics everyone's a beginner
90 however 90% of the market are
beginners you're going to be much better
off taking on fewer clients charging
more and building the base of your
income with a lower pric digital product
that allows you to scale so in my case I
was a freelance web designer so to free
up more time and take on less client
work I created two products in my first
year as a Creator as my audience was
growing the first was a freelancing
product so I just taught the principles
of freelancing the basics what I knew
under my name with everything that
helped me and how I just did it the
second was a web design product because
I understood that okay if people don't
have a skill to freelance with then I
need to give them a skill to freelance
with and teach them that skill so I
created a web design course on how to
create websites and landing pages in my
second year I stopped freelance web
design as a whole I had so much more
experience at this point it didn't make
sense to continue doing something less
profitable and more timec consuming so I
transitioned into marketing Consulting
for online businesses I had Direct
access to them on social media anyway it
just made sense and eventually I did the
same thing so I evolved one my previous
freelance into digital product and then
that the freelance service pivoted and
changed into something more valuable
with the experience that I had I wasn't
stuck to it or attached to it I just did
something new so after that I got rid of
the other digital products and I created
better ones from the service that I was
already offering the marketing
Consulting and brand Consulting so the
fourth and final principle is just
promotions which is the destroyer of
Brands so I've talked about my book The
Art of focus launching soon Link in the
description for close to 3 years now
because it's taken that long to actually
write it and the thing here is is that I
still have people message or comment
that they didn't know I was writing a
book even if they've been following me
for three years so just because someone
has followed you for a certain amount of
time does not mean that they know what
you sell or how they can pay you even if
they're a perfect fit you have to
promote promoting means that you're
telling people about your product or
service and sending them to a landing
page with a payment link so a simple
framework for promotions and you can
study copyrighting Frameworks in order
to learn more or to practice but this is
one you can just practice with now it's
called Pas problem amplify solution so
with the problem capture their attention
by talking about the problem they are
facing that your product solves quote
unquote if you struggle with is a great
place to start amplify is talking about
how the problem impacts their life and
why it needs to be solved solution is
positioning your offer as the solution
to the problem so they click and read
more you can plug your products services
or newsletter in the comments of your
post in your story or randomly in your
writing like I did above with the book
and whenever people come to me with
problems with their marketing it's it's
usually just a lack of promotion and
good promotion getting people to click
and then guiding them down the page and
they can't monetize consistently because
they don't promote consistently they
don't have a schedule or system in place
to promote every single day they don't
have that block on their calendar that
says go and make some money
because you're broke then that's what
allows you to make money is promoting
you don't have a marketing and sales
department like the job you work at you
are the marketing and sales department
so just to summarize how to make a
million dollar a year as a writer first
thing is that I wish I could tell you
that it's going to be easy but it's not
as anything worthwhile in life the
principles are pretty straight forward
they're set out for you use writing to
build a readership that grows infinitely
with the internet if you know how to
improve when you hit a stunt in growth
if you're as I said if you're an
entrepreneur then you have to be able to
identify problems in both your life and
your business and solve them if the
problem is there like oh I'm not making
enough money I'm not making the amount
of money that I want to make then you
have to change something you have to
create a solution you stick it out for
multiple years if not the rest of your
life entrepreneurship means you are in
full control of how much you make your
income is only limited by your
perspective beliefs skill set and real
