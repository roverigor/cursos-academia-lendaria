if you clicked on this video without
getting offended by the title then good
job if you got offended by the title
then you're you probably won't get
anything from this video your mind is
already made up on the subject and I
won't be able to change it if you're in
between where you're like hmm what does
he mean by that then I feel like he'll
get a lot out of this video on how to
escape wage slavery and how
entrepreneurship is Modern Survival now
I've talked about this multiple times in
the past I'm not anti-nine to five I'm
not anti-working a job I think it's very
useful I think it's an absolutely
incredible path to go down if you want
to climb up the ranks and get a
high-paying job and you love that job I
don't see anything wrong with that at
all right and I have the argument that
I'm going to present I also worked a
nine to five for a good amount of my
life just putting that out here I'm
providing a perspective that is rather
polarizing on how to escape wage slavery
and it always splits people into two
camps and you don't have to fall within
either of those camps you can agree with
both sides so let's
just dive in you are a slave and I'm a
slave and slaves don't know that they're
slaves if everyone else is too because
just because the slavery that everyone
knows and hates of the past isn't a
thing anymore doesn't mean that slavery
doesn't still exist I'm talking about
mental and financial slavery here slave
noun a person who is forced to work for
and Obey another and is considered to be
their property the key word in that
definition is force and force can have
many different definitions and contexts
so for the sake of this video we are
going to use this one force noun
strength or energy as an attribute of
physical action or movement in other
words there is something that is pushing
you to do one thing over another thing
and the stronger that something is that
is forcing you in the other direction
the more of a slave you are because a
slave of the past they could if they
knew they were slaves it was just normal
then they didn't really maybe they were
labeled as a slave but it was just thing
but they could if they wanted to run
away but they would be forced back
because of death they would run out of
shelter they would run out of food they
would run out of water they were slaves
not only because they were Chained and
held there by force but they were also
forced because it their survival
depended on it so with that said
survival plays a huge role in modern
slavery and as we've discussed earlier
human survival is not only physical the
physical survival that we experienced in
the past is mostly like automated now
it's a lot easier we're much more
comfortable in many parts of the world
but human survival is mostly conceptual
humans survive form self ego or Identity
or however you want to label a
distinction within Consciousness so
let's go over some examples the first is
political ideologies if you identify as
a Republican or a Democrat and your
beliefs are challenged then you will
feel a physical threat response because
of that your survival feels threatened
because you consider that idea or belief
system political belief system as a part
of who you are your concept of self it's
a psychic body it is not your physical
body it is an idea the next example is
sports teams have you ever noticed that
some people get visibly angry when their
sports team loses or someone says that
their sports team sucks especially if
they have money on the line because
that's also tied to their survival and
your team spirit for that team makes you
feel like you are a part of something
greater than yourself it is your
spirituality that is a very good thing
but it does not have to hurt your mental
health you can detach from it the next
example is your identity are you a
coffee snob are you a health expert are
you just a productive person that
studied like productivity tips and
tricks if someone tells you to stop
drinking coffee how do you feel if
someone tells you that the keto diet is
the best diet how do you feel do you
want to educate them on what you know is
best or that you have experience with
the ideology that you have attached to
your identity and feel the need to
survive even when you know that blanket
statements don't reply to every single
person on Earth across different
cultures with different resources and if
you're a productive person and you move
to a new location how do you feel your
routine just got destroyed out of
nowhere you were surviving the form that
is your routine through effort energy
and habit you need a week or two to
acclimate to the new location yeah and
this is where I'm often a slave is to my
routines or getting into a structure or
a flow in life and then something
threatening that and me feeling not very
good because of it and I sometimes
choose to stay inside and do my own
thing rather than go and experience
something that I know would be good for
me so the last example here is just
religious ideologies because even if
people say that they don't want to
convert you to their belief system they
are still going to do it unconsciously
because they're conditioned to reproduce
their identity reproduction is a part of
survival and if we survive on the
conceptual level then any form of
communication is trying to reproduce who
we are with the ideas that form our
concept of self that's how you create
other human beings your parents did not
only birth you physically but they
created you mentally with the ideas that
they shared and communicated to you do
you start to see why I am so big on the
Creator economy and understanding that
is because you're creating selves you're
creating selves around the world and
that changes human behavior and what
people do with their lives and that's
what leads to evolution in a positive
direction this is also why I'm very big
on education self-education skill
acquisition all this it goes much
much much deeper than just oh you can
make ten thousand dollars a month and
this is also why there are bad parts of
the crater economy because mental phone
slaves often end up unsuccessful because
all of the ideas that they're consumed
assuming creates who they are so if
they're watching all of this degenerate
information and memes that tell them
they hate their lives and they can only
afford certain foods or that oh like
it's so funny I have 10 cents in my bank
account I can't afford chicken nuggets
and so they think they that's the
standard that they set for themselves in
their in their mind for who they are
because they program themselves to be
that way rather than surrounding
themselves with the digital people that
they want to become like so with that we
now need to understand how Society is a
pyramid scheme of attention so if
something is not given attention it does
not exist and if it does not exist it
must be given attention and should be
able to be given attention in order to
not only come to life but to survive so
if you stop paying attention to who you
are and feeding those thoughts then
you'd experience death ego death that's
what you hear if you're familiar with
spiritual teachings and meditation
that's what they're saying stop giving
life to the negative aspects of what you
don't want to pay attention to and so
this brings two realizations the first
is that you are contributing to
unconscious destruction because how do
Mega corporations grow and Thrive they
start small and they form a power
hierarchy over time fewer people with
more power at the top and more people
with less power at the bottom the top
tier of the hierarchy which is the
company itself and the executives and
the board and all of that stuff they can
only do what they do because a plethora
of people are giving attention to the
tasks visions and values from the bottom
up there is a pyramid of attention going
on here that allows the people at the
top to not have to do or pay attention
to any of the things under at least from
like the detail the technical details
they can pay attention to the big
picture and help manage it but at the
end of the day like they're not in there
doing the work and so these Mega
corporations would not be able to
survive if the attention that's the root
of it right you could say oh they're
just workers what what do you have to do
first in order to work it's pay
attention attention is the root of all
of it so the company would collapse if
there was no attention to build that
company or Focus get my book Thor to
focus when it comes out end of September
and so often people aren't paying
attention to what they're actually
paying attention to they don't see the
depth behind their actions because at
the bottom of the pyramid it's low skill
grunt work like a cash here at
McDonald's and by Nature it is
impossible for every single person that
is at the bottom to rise up to higher
and higher levels simply because there's
less people you there has to be the
attention Filled from under and so this
is why I see many nine to five jobs as a
stepping stone to doing what you want or
even job hopping until you get to where
you want and so the problem is that the
people at the bottom are unconscious of
what they're actually contributing to
like how McDonald's workers probably
don't understand or care that they are
poisoning millions of people across
across the country because the cashiers
they probably aren't giving attention to
the nutrition knowledge to educate
themselves on what it actually takes to
be a healthy individual and if they did
have that education or health knowledge
then they probably wouldn't be working
at the McDonald's there they would be
doing their own thing working as a
nutrition coach or working under a
nutrition coach or whatever other jobs
fall within the Health and Fitness
domain they could go after that with the
knowledge that they have because they
paid attention to the things that gave
them that knowledge another example is
how military programmers write the code
that kills millions of people on the
other side of the planet or even a web
designer that creates websites for a
person that scams people and of course
there's a quote for this where it's just
forgive them for they know not what they
do so that was the first point is that
you are contributing to unconscious
destruction the second point is that you
can bring a conscious Vision into
reality the only way to escape is to
build your own thing but this is
increasingly difficult because most
people are more than just wage slaves
they're slaves to many different things
in their lives whether it be addictions
their phone and other things like that
it's taken you 20 30 and even 40 years
to dig yourself into where you are now
it's going to take some time to dig you
back out so the way out is to become a
value Creator which I've talked about
before in the value Creator video
because True Value is creative and
creativity allows for change in
emergence it allows for new levels of
the hierarchy to be created and for you
to create your own hierarchy to advance
within if you don't understand this
whole hierarchy thing that I'm talking
about go and watch niching down is
terrible advice for smart people and so
if the only value that you have to
provide is physical and not creative
then you will get stuck in manual labor
jobs if you are not creating anything
with your mind that is because that's
what all the people at the top are doing
they're creative and they're using the
power of their mind to create things
that are valuable and distribute that to
other people so as we always talk about
you have to push the boundaries of the
unknown learn and discover new
potentials along the way acquire the
skills necessary to build a purposeful
product solve your own problems so you
create a solution of True Value and
start a business as a vessel to
actualize your vision for the future I
talk about this a lot in the one-person
business model series so with this whole
slavery thing I'm tired of both sides of
the argument one side is like all nine
to five workers are slaves and then the
other side is like no no it's okay
you're not a slave don't worry you're
perfect the way you are both are wrong
and both are right in some cases because
when people say this online both are
trying to maximize the engagement they
get they don't zoom out and think if
people are actually slaves and most
people don't want to face that reality a
published idea without depth is a
disservice to humanity so the fact of
the matter is that 95 percent of nine to
five workers are slaves and your
feelings do not matter here if you do
feel threatened by someone talking to
you through a screen then maybe there is
some truth to what I'm saying you would
only feel threatened if your survival
were at stake so look inward to see what
you're hiding from because most workers
are the literal definition of a slave if
you cannot stop showing up to work for
your survival and have no skills to open
other options immediately and you are
the property or employee of a certain
company that's a slave now this doesn't
mean that you can't be happy everyone is
a slave in one way or another and we all
have waves of happiness in our life if
happiness is the feeling we get when our
attention is distracted from the vast
unhappiness in the world then slavery
may make some people happier than
non-slaves because you can be happy at
points in your life while being
unconscious of the problems in your life
that would make you unhappy until you
have to develop the skill to fix those
problems to become happy again and so
again I'm not here to demonize nine to
five jobs I see them as a stepping stone
I also see beginner level business
models as a stepping stone like
freelance work agents you work coaching
businesses and sometimes digital
products they're all a stepping stone in
your life's work and they can easily
enslave you not all people that do this
are slaves but the people that don't
pivot and evolve Beyond them start to
become slaves to them and so with this a
personal brand however like a Creator
the the topic of that the umbrella in my
eyes is not a business model it is it is
how you display your character in the
digital world so that you can distribute
your value through that character as if
you were in the physical world your
personal brand is you and you can get
enslaved by the business model that you
choose to operate from with that
personal brand so now with that covered
we need to talk about how
entrepreneurship is Modern Survival so
let's take a look at this graphic and
you can see here there are a few things
on the top there's the unknown which is
where you get good dopamine which is
uncomfortable on the bottom there's the
known which is just a site cycle of
cheap dopamine and comfort and in the
middle is where meaning and fulfillment
is found that's at the edge of the known
or the edge of the unknown and so the
white line is represents employment the
dotted line represents entrepreneurship
and so you can see that with employment
you get that initial good dopamine
because you're making progress but then
the work starts to become more and more
repetitive you know what you're doing
you probably won't get promoted you
don't Advance up the ladder and things
just remain the same for the rest of
your life and you quickly go into the
known and just a cycle of cheap dopamine
you become a monkey in a cubicle but
with entrepreneurship you go up and down
and up and down and you have much more
control over the balance in your life
the good dopamine to cheap dopamine and
the skill required to stay at the edge
and Find meaning and fulfillment because
your psyche is wired to hunt imagine our
ancestors walking by a bare Bush every
day it doesn't serve their future at
time but one day it grows new berries
somebody walks by it they notice and
that novelty causes excitement they
either gather the berries or remember
them later so they can survive longer
and so when you get stuck in a nine to
five or freelance work or agency work or
any of the new digital nine to fives you
start to live in the Eternal known you
can't make new discoveries in the known
you can't hunt you get bored depressed
and see life as meaningless because the
only dopamine you get is from
superficial sources you never take risks
push into the unknown and discover new
knowledge tools and potentials that
raise dopamine levels in your brain you
must evolve entrepreneurship is the path
of uncertainty like slashing your way
through the jungle you are required to
learn skills that aren't taught in
schools you are required to be okay with
failure rejection and slow progress
you're required to learn from your
mistakes show up again tomorrow and push
until you strike gold as an entrepreneur
you hunt for your Survival by gathering
knowledge creating a valuable product
and putting it in front of people that
could benefit from it and as I've
discussed my path for doing this is to
start a personal brand as the foundation
solve your own problems in the real
world which revolve around health wealth
and relationships distribute your
findings opinions and beliefs via
writing start with a freelance or
coaching service and get results sell a
physical or digital product that
requires less time invested once your
audience grows make a hefty income in
two to four years with persistence and
iteration and then finally expand your
vision for the future and build whatever
you want to get there which could be
software spaceships whatever you want
and this is the entire process that I
give with templates and education inside
of digital economics so now we have to
talk about the balance of skill and
opportunity because I'm a slave to many
things in my life but I would like to
believe that I've escaped wage slavery
because if my business got wiped from
the face of the earth I could still
create a product or service that someone
else needs call email advertise and
spread internet content to drive traffic
to that offer make 5 to 10K a month and
improve that the data I've gathered so
why can I do this but most people can't
it's because over the past 10 years I've
learned graphic design web development
digital art Photoshop illustrator
copywriting psychology Marketing sales
video editing audience building
advertising product design course
creation idea generation lifestyle
design bodybuilding nutrition social
media and more that most people struggle
with with zero dollars to my name I
could create a product or service and
sell it to someone else that I know that
needs it for example I could create a
service that teaches people how to build
landing pages that sell so I could
charge a thousand to twenty five hundred
for a four called boot camp depending on
how I want to structure that offer I
would Target new businesses that have a
full website because that isn't even
close to an optimal way to sell a
product or service or I would Target
students who want to learn a profitable
skill outside of employment or I would
Target creators that want the first step
in monetizing their brand outside of
platform Revenue I would spend three
hours in the morning dming people and
writing marketing content online and the
thing is that people will read this and
try to replicate it which I recommend
you do but you have to understand that
at this point me starting over again I
have 10 years of experience I know the
little nuances of all of this stuff so
when you go to school your mind is
narrowed on the select few skills that
will make you employable or replaceable
and with every skill that I learned
outside of school I can spot multiple
opportunities that allow me to make an
income outside of a job and this effect
compounds with the skills I've developed
I can create 50 different products that
I know will be profitable within the
first six months of my effort simply
because I've invested my attention in
myself so if you want to do this
yourself let's go over the steps for how
you're going to do that step one is
drown in new information to program your
mind because most people are drowning in
information that has nothing to do with
their goals they don't have a vision
goal or problem to interpret situations
through because the chances are is that
you've already read life-changing
information but it didn't register in
your awareness because you didn't have a
goal to apply it to you could have read
a book that was absolutely life-changing
to another person but then you go and
read it and you're like it was kind of a
good book it wasn't that good and so
with the goal of escaping wage slavery
at the top of your mind you can schedule
a minimum of 20 minutes dedicated to
consuming information that will help
with that goal you can buy books use
your audible credits save podcasts
follow new social accounts and add new
videos to your watch later on YouTube
you can get out of your house have a
Notes app open on your phone and write
down your discoveries as you immerse
yourself in the information you will
feel the dopamine in your brain on the
hunt for a better life now the second
thing you can do is study purposeful
businesses that you aspire to build so
now that you have a consumption habit of
gathering good information you need a
more practical goal to apply the
information that you're learning so what
business do you build to escape wage
slavery you take mental note of the apps
and activities you incorporate in your
life on a daily basis you look at who
you follow in the businesses they've
built you buy a book or course on a
specific business model that interests
you you must discover a business model
that you feel pulled to build one that
you can become obsessed with it doesn't
really matter which one it is an
emulation is what helped me build my
first successful business it helped me
identify blind spots before I even got
to them get in the habit of studying
people you want to be like downloading
and purchasing everything they have to
offer and making a mind map of
everything they have online social media
profiles websites landing pages email
sequences products Services lead magnets
books everything reverse engineer what
allows them to be successful if you
don't know what to do after that I do
not know what to tell you and step
number three is to become your own
dopamine dealer my friend and I were
having a discussion the other day and
I'll paraphrase what he said you know
it's wild I remember asking you why none
of your friends take action or follow in
your footsteps I get it now people are
dopamine junkies even businessmen the
people that don't take action don't know
how to replace the dopamine they are
getting from their current habits with
business so they either don't start or
quit after a week because they couldn't
get their hit and this made me think
back to realize what actually worked for
me I was constantly chasing the good old
dopamine but in the right direction so
here's my advice hold a loose idea of
what you want in life money success
peace fulfillment start building
something anything that will make that a
reality I would of course recommend a
one-person business because it is long
term learn what you want to learn the
most to help build it skills courses
websites logos whatever so you get your
dopamine hit don't be afraid to change
what you're doing if you get bored I
attribute my unique success to shiny
object syndrome I failed at seven
different businesses and learned even
more skills along the way just because
they sounded interesting to me and what
most don't see is that I wouldn't be
here without those failures I had to
become a modern renaissance man in order
to make this business model work the
skills I learned with each failure
compounded into better opportunities my
tweets wouldn't be the same without
copywriting my web pages wouldn't be be
the same without web design my profile
picture and branding wouldn't be the
same without Photoshop art the list goes
on replace the habits that keep you
enslaved with habits that will break you
free it won't happen immediately be okay
with that if you can stay on the path
you win that's it for this video I
appreciate you watching digital
economics if you want to productize
yourself to our writer if you want to
learn a valuable skill in the modern
Marketplace you can find links to both
of those in the description along with
free tools newsletters
Etc that's all I got have a good one
peace
