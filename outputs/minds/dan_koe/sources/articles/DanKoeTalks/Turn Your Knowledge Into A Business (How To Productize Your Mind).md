when I was young I made a crucial
observation I had to earn with my mind
not my time I made the distinction
between labor workers and creative
workers labor workers would try to
accomplish as much as their body could
handle and as much time as they had
creative workers would focus on solving
the problems that led to the most
results regardless of the time they
spent labor workers were locked into a
salary and schedule that paid them a
certain amount of money for their
efforts creative workers created their
own salary and schedule that paid them
according to the level of problem they
solved there's nothing wrong with labor
work understand that you are trading
time for money and your time is limited
doctors can be paid a great salary this
is obvious this is what most people or a
lot of people want to go into they want
to be a doctor they want to be an
engineer etc etc but a doctor is paid
the same amount whether they save a life
or just tell someone to take aspirin as
an example of a creative worker a writer
can be paid as much as they want
depending on what they write what their
product is and how far their writing
spreads the main difference between
labor workers and creative workers is
owning a business because business is
about solving creative problems and
developing a product that is valuable
and can sell at any time as soon as you
stop solving creative problems around
product and reach your income stagnates
and you become a slave to the work you
built yourself into now let's quickly
discuss my Evolution from time to mind
and we'll start off with this those that
monetize their mind unlock a luxury
unfathomable to those who monetize their
time when I first started in business
the first logical option was to
freelance with a skill it seemed
beginner friendly and it cost $0 to
start that was the promise that people
were saying online that were teaching
how to freelance and it's true with
years of manual effort the joy that I
got out of building the business slowly
declined as my responsibilities
increased I could only take on a
specific amount of clients I only had so
much time in the day and unless I wanted
to stay at my self-made 9o5 I had to
solve creative problems I had to evolve
creativity is dependent on the expansion
of your mind and this is why I always
say that personal growth equals business
growth because personal growth expanding
yourself is expanding your mind to allow
for the expansion of self so through
education and exposing myself to the
unknown I registered new opportunities
to solve my problem I wasn't going to be
able to solve the problem that I had
from the same mind that created it so I
had to explore new business
opportunities that I probably wouldn't
understand or even register as an
opportunity before I started because I
didn't see it possible to start a
business that required money or a
certain skill set because I hadn't had
that money or skill set and that's why I
started a freelance business to start so
for Freelancers out there here's an
early lesson is that if you're looking
for more then you have to break out of
the freelancer mindset by learning and
educating yourself on a potentially new
business model that you want to evolve
into that's the business model that
we're going to talk about in this video
I began writing online to attract new
clients this removed the time suck of
manually reaching out to potential
clients with cold email cold call and
cold messages I built a digital product
that could sell while I sleep this
removed my absolute dependence on client
work to survive I pivoted my freelance
offer into a Consulting offer this cut
my client work times in half I could
charge more and do less because I was
helping someone rather than doing it for
them during this time I made a discovery
that changed the direction of my life if
I could gain one reader I could gain 1
million and if I could gain one buyer I
could gain 1,000 2.8 million readers and
20,000 buyers later my Discovery held
true now my creative problem solving has
evolved Beyond a one-person business now
I'm focused on building cortex and that
requires a team in order for me to
achieve the goal related to that and
with starting anything new you're
usually you can't digest the information
you can't digest the workload until your
mental or work related metabolism can
catch up or you get used to that or you
build the muscle that allows you to lift
that emotional weight and so I'm
focusing on providing quality work of
course but then Outsourcing and
delegating so that I can kind of gain my
time back one lesson before we begin you
can't eradicate manual labor from your
life altogether it is a slow and painful
Evolution and sometimes you regress now
that I've taken on the responsibility of
starting a larger company my manual work
has increased substantially but iust
that I can lower it quickly with my
prior experience so here's what we're
going to discuss in this video One the
macronutrients of business two
Progressive overload of skill three time
under attention four how to re reinvent
yourself five documenting your mind on
the internet and six how to create a
brand content product and promotions
that make you money one more thing
before we start is that we've opened up
more spots for our VIP and Mastermind
which is under cortex as the software is
being developed so this is a chance
while we have the time and are actually
offering the services to work with
myself and Justin Scott and Joey Justice
to create a brand or independent income
source and learn to write online to
build digital leverage and sell whatever
it is that you want to sell based on
your interests or skills and if you're a
Founder that just wants to kind of bring
more leads and authority to the company
that you own then that is also an option
but you can apply with the cortex Link
in the description let's talk about the
parallels of bodybuilding and business
building when you deconstruct the mind
and body you can map patterns that
deepen your understanding across most
domains of life we will connect these
patterns to the Financial domain of Life
by starting a business and we can start
to think of our mind as a mental body
that you build like you would in
bodybuilding like we discussed in my
video on mental Aesthetics the video is
called how to reprogram your mind and
build your intelligence so we can think
of yourself as your mental body that you
can build like you would with
bodybuilding where you digest
information like you digest food you
acquire skill like you build muscle but
connecting that to business with a
personal brand which is arguably the
most potent lead generation just front
end of a business right now because
people follow humans they don't follow
Company accounts like how Red Bull
doesn't post any of their product
pictures like companies don't know how
to run social media they don't have
individuals being the face of the brand
so that's what building a business
nowadays is it's displaying your
character or yourself or the mental body
that you've built and constructed to be
valuable over time in order to create
content and a product that sell and make
you an independent income a business is
just that a vessel for Value exchange
personal growth is self-development
business growth is other development so
in nutrition there are four
macronutrients fat carbs protein alcohol
and in business there are four pillars
that will determine your success the
macronutrients of business which is
brand content product promotions we're
going to break these all down later in
nutrition there's a plethora of micro
nutrients that are vital for just bodily
function in business there are skills
interests experience knowledge
creativity and personality that
determine the potency of your efforts
your job is to fuel your business with
the proper Creative Nutrition to succeed
and now there is the option to opt for
the business keto diet which is like
removing carbs from your diet but it'd
be removing content from your business
and only going after ads but there are
many reasons I would advise solely
against that only doing doing that many
people go the direct response marketing
route and only use ads to fuel their
business but the benefits of content
make it an unreasonable approach
especially for beginners without money
to invest in making mistakes to learn
advertising now of course I'm not saying
this is bad it's a clearly a very viable
way of getting customers and growing
your business but by just having a daily
writing habit you can validate High
performing ideas as content to use in
your ads or promotions you get to keep
the audience you acquire you aren't
always burning through money to acquire
new customers and last you create
customers over time by writing content
for all levels of awareness we're going
to talk about this in future videos but
the problem is that marketers will go to
try and build a social media audience
and then their page is just promotions
they're just writing ads the entire time
that doesn't work you have to focus on
education you have to create customers
by having a broad personal brand where
you are the niche build trust and
educate them over time and then it
compounds until you have a let's say
YouTube following of 1 million people
every YouTube video is as powerful as a
webinar and if your webinar makes you
seven figures then do the math you can
spend hundreds of thousands of dollars a
year on ads or you can build a 100,000
follower audience over a year and get
the same amount of Impressions now
that's very good if you can build
100,000 followers in a year that's
extremely good that's for people that
have like a lot of experience and do it
well and almost near perfect so don't
expect that much but
aim big so that's the macronutrients of
business let's talk about Progressive
overload of skill and challenge so I've
used this graphic before but on the left
axis we have the challenge level on the
bottom axis we have the skill level so
when the challenge is too high but your
skill is too low you get anxious or
self-conscious you start thinking about
yourself and how you aren't good enough
and when the challenge is too low but
your skill is too high you get bored and
you become self-centered like oh what
what could I be doing better with my
time when you're bored at work all the
time because it's repetitive and you
don't realize that you need to evolve in
order to find fulfillment in life you
start thinking all day about better
things you could be doing and then the
Middle where skill and challenge match
that's when you get into the Flow State
so when you're just starting out it's
unwise to take on too much as a
oneperson business because you have to
become the Marketing sales operations
and media Department you are a media
company you're a marketing company
you're a sales company you're everything
you can't just focus on the one skill
that you want to sell and not learn how
to sell it and beyond that you can't not
learn how to fulfill a service after you
sell it to create a brand content
product and promotions you will need to
learn at least the fundamentals of
marketing and sales graphic design web
design copywriting content writing email
marketing social media this is a
blessing and a curse and this is also
why the people nowadays with the most
business failures like trying to start
businesses and failing like dropshipping
and faceb Facebook ads social media
marketing agency etc etc that's why they
eventually do so well is because they
stack so much lessons and skills from
their failures the next Endeavor just
makes sense because they have all of the
pieces so if you've never learned any
modern skills this is obviously going to
take a while you will get overwhelmed
and anxious at the thought of a future
you don't have the skill to create
Clarity with but the thing here is is
this business model that I always talk
about a Ju Just a personal brand with a
product you and a product that you would
personally buy and treating yourself as
the niche and using your content as
traffic to that product and making a
meaningful income that way it's that
simple beautiful thing about this social
media is the perfect vessel to build as
you learn and that's the only way to
truly learn something is to build with
your learning and so just an example of
what I mean by this is if you want to
learn graphic design then go and create
your profile picture and then create
your bio and create your banner and
create your website featured image and
create those things and learn via
specific tutorials as you go that's how
you learn what you actually need to
learn in order to help your own business
or then have a skill that you can help
another business because this is all
businesses are they're all media
companies nowadays if a company isn't a
media company then you need to turn them
into one because that's what your skill
is going to help them with with this
digital transformation everyone going
digital and huge Company accounts having
no idea how to create a social media
account in bodybuilding you
progressively over overload the muscle
by adding weight to the bar over time if
you ego lift and put on too much weight
you won't be able to lift it and you'll
probably look like an idiot start small
and build your skill stack with time do
not start learning until you start
building buy courses books and search
for Content that teaches how to do all
of this well as you are building create
one project set one goal learn one skill
get good at it so you have mental energy
for the next and repeat so first build
your profile study social media and
graphic design for your banner and
profile picture second start writing
content study copywriting content
writing marketing and post structures
third ideate a product study Marketing
sales and offer creation fourth learn to
promote study email marketing promotions
and copywriting again with all of this
don't get complacent if you don't seek a
higher challenge after you stop seeing
good results from the first you will get
bored boredom leads to thoughts of
quitting because you feel like there is
something better you could be doing with
your time so in the gym a great thing
you can do to learn this is how I mean
this is how you learn as a child as
you're learning to walk or speak or
whatever it is you go to the gym and You
observe what the advanced people are
doing and how they're lifting now some
people obviously are just training how
they like and they may not be using the
best form there's a lot to actually
distinguish here so watching them
observing them emulating them and then
also supplementing that style of
learning learning via something like
YouTube videos or something else to
actually figure out okay what's the best
form how do I eat the best etc etc
relating this to business you can pull
inspiration from the accounts you most
want to be like because that's who you
are anyways that's how your identity was
forged is you're following these people
online you're taking in their worldview
you like that worldview because of the
results that it's brought your life so
it is wise to this is what creativity is
is pulling from a bunch of different
sources in order to create your own
original one and that process repeats
itself as the universe evolves and
slowly things get better and better so
there's just one thing to understand
here is that not everyone is at the same
level if you go to my let's say like
Instagram profile and you look at my bio
that's just what I want to put there
I've gotten to the point where I've
played by the rules so much and I've
gotten good results with the rules that
it's like hey I'm not going to play by
the rules anymore so if you want to
create a bio that leads to better stuff
then you're probably not going to be
better you're not going to be well off
copying me you're going to be better off
learning from me when I actually had a
specific bio that was tailored to the
level that I was at and that's what I
teach in my courses because I don't
teach how to do what I do now because
that wouldn't apply to you I teach what
I did in order to get where I am so the
lesson is to just learn from people that
are slightly above your skill level
progressively overload now let's talk
about time under attention I finally
labeled this concept I created this
concept I'm so I'm proud of this time
under attention is the amount of
attention you hold with each piece of
content times the quantity of content
times the quality of content times how
often your ideas live in their head
times how much they spread your ideas
without effort equals the authority
profitability and power your brand holds
so in weight training there's a concept
called time under tension that's how
long your muscles are under tension of
the weight and some argue that it is a
main driver of muscle growth along with
Progressive overload but I'm here here
to argue the same thing with business
growth rather than it being time under
attention it's time under attention this
is arguably the most important thing
that you should pay attention to when
you're building your brand or writing
your content attention is the currency
of the third millennium the more people
pay attention to you the more power you
have authors podcasters and YouTubers
often have the most loyal audiences why
because information creates identity the
more attention you hold the more
information you deliver you program the
minds of your audience in a way that is
conducive to actually changing their
life and people attribute results to the
people that change their life you can
write short posts for social media all
day long but someone that has held more
attention than you is always going to
outperform you I always bring up the
example of James clear so we're going to
talk about this again hopefully this may
cause the click for you James Clear will
get more engagement and reach because
one people have adopted his worldview
two people quote him in their content
newsletters and podast podcast this is
extremely important I saw like growth of
50,000 subscribers over the past like 2
weeks and I had no idea where it was
coming from because my videos weren't
performing any better than usual and
then I started talking to people and
they're like yeah dude you're just being
mentioned everywhere like in other
people's YouTube videos and you're being
quoted and other things and so these
bigger accounts that are mentioning me
are just giving me more Authority
because I help them and third anytime
someone else posts a related idea to
clear the authority is given to him
because he comes to mind while reading
your content clear is still holding
their attention while they read others
content so he wrote the book Atomic
habits anytime someone's read Atomic
habits and then they go and read another
piece of content about habits James
Clear is sitting in the back of their
mind they're internally giving James CLE
more attention so if a tweet holds 30
seconds of attention a book that lives
in their head rentree has a lot more
attention than just 30 seconds or even
the the 5 hours it took to read that
book it could consume days weeks months
years of attention over their lifetime
depending on how well they resonated
with the long form time under attention
that came with the book Atomic habits or
any book you've read this is why I'm
writing a book even when books are like
the least profitable thing you can make
directly profitable now this does not
mean that short form posts on things
like X or Tik Tok or YouTube shorts or
Instagram or LinkedIn are useless
they're not it's the complete opposite
they have their use cases this isn't
black and white you have to think
holistically here I'm making a point
that time under attention is extremely
important like in bodybuilding that's
not the only driver of muscle growth
it's like yeah you can sit there and
hold a weit so your time under attention
is like increasing a bunch but if you're
not eating food like if you're just
sitting there starving not eating
anything are you going to build muscle
are you going to grow your brand no I
see short form platforms as a way to
attract a broad audience quicker to fuel
your long form platforms that are are
arguably more difficult to grow I almost
always recommend starting with short
form to build an audience build a
network and validate High performing
ideas that you can then turn into long
form videos newsletters or combine all
of them into a book and the longer you
do it the more attention you hold
quitting after 1 to 6 months is stupid
1% of 50 years is 6 months if this is
the work you see yourself doing for your
entire life don't quit during the
tutorial phase if I create 365 posts a
year on all platforms and those posts
hold attention for 30 seconds that's 3
hours of attention held per reader on
each platform over a year if I create
one long form post a week for newsletter
YouTube and podcast all being the same
and these posts hold 20 minutes of
attention that's 52 hours of attention
held per reader for all platforms
compared to 3 hours per reader for short
form so it's important that you treat
short form platforms for what they are a
way to build a broad audience faster
validate ideas and funnel people into
various products and long form content
for writers I always recommend using X
and a newsletter one short form and one
long form platform to start then when
you do this long enough and see enough
growth you can start to repurpose the
newsletter to YouTube podcast Etc and
you can start to repurpose your tweets
to uh LinkedIn YouTube Community posts
Instagram use them as scripts for reels
and shorts Etc this is what I teach into
our writer this is why writing is is the
most important and valuable skill you
can learn because it's the foundation of
all of this now let's turn yourself into
the business or understand mental
monetization brand is your character
content is your mindset and skill set
product is how you achieve a meaningful
goal promotions are why you achieve the
meaningful goal your self or identity is
your mental body the self is a web of
Concepts beliefs ideas experiences and
perceptions that allow you to navigate
the world the information you learn and
use since birth is what shapes the self
your identity shapes your perspective
and your perspective is the most
important thing you can understand and
expand your perspective is your reality
a perspective is a frame composed of
goals problems and skill to overcome
those problems to achieve those goals it
is also composed of beliefs knowledge
and experiences that either limit or Aid
in the achievement of goals solving of
problems and understanding of knowledge
when we aren't conscious of the goals
that compose our perspective we are not
choosing how we act the goals were
assigned to us if we don't have the
skill to overcome problems to achieve
goals we get anxious overwhelmed and
negative to the point of lashing out
when you don't seek to understand the
goal of someone else in life social
media politics religion or the rest it's
easy for us to misinterpret their
situation and think they are stupid for
doing what they do in reality we lack
perspective the reason I'm explaining
the importance of perspective is because
your perspective shapes the entirety of
your brand that is your Niche we're
going to talk about this in a video two
to three videos from now called The
anti- Niche or again talking about how
the most profitable Niche is you because
if you break down a perspective where
it's goal problem Clarity or path or
skill or knowledge to achieve that goal
that's all a brand is you're leading
people towards a goal you're helping
them with skill set and mindset with
content and you're giving them a system
or Clarity to achieve the goal with a
product that's turning yourself into the
business turning your mind or
perspective into the business that's
earning with your mind and it's just
human behavior in general once you peel
back to just what the foundation of life
is life and business becomes pretty
 easy let's break down the
macronutrients of business one brand is
your online character or identity the
front end of a business is a brand this
is what they display online to attract
the right people and illustrate their
digital identity since we are turning
yourself or identity into the business
your job job is to attract the people
you can help the most people that are
like you the people who share the same
goals and problems as your past or
present self but don't have the skill to
achieve and overcome them you already
have the knowledge experience and skills
to pass down to those who are one step
behind you that's all you need to start
a business so your job on your website
or landing page or social media profiles
or anywhere where you're trying to
explain and articulate your brand is
this imply a meaningful goal you help
people achieve imply a burning problem
you can help them solve imply the
interests or skills that you teach to
bridge the gap between problem and goal
this creates your digital reality this
is what people are doing they're
adopting your worldview by following you
it creates the frame that you and your
customers can perceive information
through so that you can exchange
knowledge and skill when you're having
an argument with your partner it's
usually because you aren't sharing the
same perspective you don't have the same
goal that is top of mind that you're
working towards you don't have the same
problem top of mind that you're trying
to solve you're perceiving the situation
differently all of this whether it be
marketing for a product or creating
content or whatever you're trying to
create a shared perspective with Goal
problem Clarity to achieve it so with
this when you're trying to imply these
things on your website or your landing
page or social media profile like your
bio you don't have to State them
explicitly this is where getting
creative and writing stories short
stories like single sentence stories
come into play your brand is created
with time under attention as people
learn more about you through your
content and products my brand slogan is
work less earn more enjoy life my bio
was occasionally I write about human
potential writing and mental Mastery so
you can do what you want I don't
recommend copying these because
obviously like different levels require
different things but you can see that
I'm implying something there even just
by saying I write about human potential
you can start to shape what problem I'm
solving and what goal I'm helping people
pursue so it just has to be implied
brand is very brand is built with time
don't worry about this too much but just
understand it number two content is your
mindset and skill set content is
extremely powerful so I'm going to try
to be as detailed as I can without just
taking up like hours of your time
content becomes a necessity when you
realize its power marketers know the
power of traffic a list of interested
customers and the power of long form
writing or video but many of them come
around to the content game late like my
myself they don't realize that the long
webinar that made you Millions can just
be a video on YouTube that gets hundreds
of thousands of views once you get the
hang of the social media game I
understand that like a webinar funnel or
whatever kind of marketing you're going
through is strategic and specific and it
may be more uh funneled than something
else but that doesn't rule out the other
benefits of content one is that you
enhance your thinking your ideas become
clear with time and it ripples into the
rest of your life you can't have a great
idea if you don't write a good idea
first your first content won't be that
good that's okay second is that it's
free most of the time you can grow
organically or you can move your ads
spend to paid growth by connecting with
and having big players share your posts
don't listen to anyone that tells you
this doesn't work they don't understand
it it doesn't work for them because
their brand and content strategy suck I
talk about this in the video how to
build an audience with zero followers
the way you grow on social media is by
leveraging people that already have the
audience there's two ways to go about it
be a slave to the algorithm or find
Network and potentially pay people that
have an audience that you want that's
what you're doing with ads anyways as
you're being like hey Facebook I want
you to Target this audience for me I'm
going to give you money to do so bypass
that pay less go to the people that have
your audience have them share your
content attract the followers in a way
where they actually want to read your
content and then you create them over
time customers over time and they're a
part of your audience they don't just
disappear after the ad disappears you
can sell anything to anyone when you
create that person because identities
are created through information AKA
content so that leads into number three
which is you create customers unlike ads
you keep your audience and can remarket
to them at any time as you create
educational content people become
customers because your information
shapes who they are and the fourth is
that you validate and test ideas fast
you can send out a tweet and if it does
better than usual I can turn that into a
sales page headline you title or entire
product that I know will sell I don't
have to split test newsletter headlines
or YouTube titles I can just write it as
a tweet and see if it does well and grow
an audience along the way so here is how
I help people that I work with in cortex
Link in the description to apply to work
with me to build their brand by
dissecting their mind and putting it on
the internet first we're going to answer
these questions it would be wise to pull
out a notebook or screenshot the
questions that come and fill it out
later or put it in like a Word document
or something question one what are 5 to
10 beliefs that are are seen as extreme
or crazy to other people but are normal
to you this is what differentiates you
and leads to the most growth example is
I believe entrepreneurship is for
everyone and have reasoning from
psychology mechanics history and
philosophy to back that number two is
what are five to 10 interests or skills
that help you create the lifestyle you
live and help your followers achieve
number three is why are those interests
or skills important what do they help
people avoid or gain in life number four
is what foundational knowledge do people
need to understand about those skills or
interests this keeps you from being too
advanced or high level so you actually
resonate with people now when you pair
these with the Ten Commandments of
Engagement content writing becomes
pretty seamless so if you go and watch
the video the greatest skill of the 21st
century which is just a few videos ago I
talk about the ten commandments of
Engagement and I have a PDF in that link
in that description that you can
download and write content with another
thing that you should understand is the
principles of value creation I made a
video on this it's called value creation
the single skill that built my solo
business and during this process
something that is very important is that
you write so that a fifth grader could
understand you you don't need to water
down your writing per se you just need
to write so that it's understandable to
the average reading level which is fifth
grade because that's just a huge problem
that I see in the space people over
complicate the wording that they're
using and they use these like Niche
phrases or they they were told to be
super specific with their audience so
they just talk to that audience the
entire time they don't give themselves
room to attract people that can become
interested in their interest so they can
create customers over time with the
content they're creating there is a way
you can word it to maintain the same
impact for more people to attract them
to your audience there isn't a reason
any measure to make your writing hyp
specific to only apply or register with
a specific amount of person you write
with specificity for impact because if
your content doesn't get spread then
you're not going to be exposed to new
audiences and you're not going to grow
cuz that's the thing is you aren't only
attracting people that are already
interested in what you do that's not
marketing you are making them interested
through persuasion and time under
attention lastly here are a few traps
that people fall into trap one they
focus way too much on promotions or
making sure they only talk about their
products talk about your beliefs
opinions and educate people on the
information necessary to become above
average in your interest and skills 80%
of the time promote sparingly it's like
cashing in Goodwill with your audience
trap two they don't understand the
importance of structure versus content
this goes far beyond writing content for
business it is a metaphysical principle
for now take your ideas and use high-
performing structures and Frameworks as
training wheels until you actually
develop your writing ability look at
quotes newsletter structures post
structures and the rest and try plugging
your ideas into them trap three is that
they don't research or use high
performing angles any idea can go viral
but only when it is positioned in an
attention grav way that entertains
educates or inspires you are a dopamine
dealer dopamine is not a bad thing if
you're doing it for Mindless pleasure
and entertainment sure and you're not
taking action sure that's not what
Educators do learning and dopamine
associated with that is good dopamine
you raise dopamine levels in your
readers brains by teaching them
something new giving them a new point of
view entertaining them or showing them
they are capable of more in life and
sparking Behavior change study your
favorite accounts most popular posts
Instagram posts YouTube videos and start
programming your mind to think in high
performing headlines the lesson of
content good content occurs when you
attempt to inject your mindset and skill
set into your readers over the course of
6 to 12 months not in one post and
number three product is how you achieved
a meaningful goal when you are the niche
people follow you because they want to
achieve the lifestyle that you have or
mindset or skill set that allowed you to
achieve that lifestyle they want to do
what you do or speak like you speak or
look like you look for Fitness people
it's like walking down the street you do
the same thing just it's online now
where you're walking down the street and
I'm like pretty cool shirt all black it
fits well I need to figure out what
brand that is and I'm going to buy it
and then I kind of become a piece of
that person or I integrate that piece to
create who I am so the thing here with
your lifestyle mindset skill set people
wanting to become like you you already
educating them on how to do it with your
content the difference between content
and product is convenient ience Clarity
and a replicable system that gets
results what is the most meaningful goal
you've achieved in your life up until
now these are questions that I'm asking
you in order to create a product my
example is that I earn a living writing
about my interests that's something
desirable that people want and it's
meaningful a potential example is I got
a six-pack without doing cardio another
example is I unlocked extreme Focus to
build my side business now next question
is what steps do people need to take to
get there my example is write build a
readership persuade and sell a potential
example is minimalist training and
intermittent fasting next question is
what do people need to learn to take
those steps my example is social media
copywriting content a potential example
is the principles of training and
nutrition the last question is what can
people practice and Implement in their
day to get results my example is the
2hour content ecosystem the potential
example is the executive training system
for busy people and I'm giving these
fancy names just because it's in my
nature as a marketer the are called
unique mechanisms so your system or
process or steps in order to achieve
your desired outcome when you slap a
compelling name on it that is a novel
thing that catches attention and it
makes people think oh this may finally
be the thing that solves my problems for
good so boom that is the outline of your
product I'll repeat the questions what
is the most meaningful goal you achieved
in your life what steps do people need
to take to get there what can those
people practice and Implement in their
day to get there and please note that
the examples I gave are not specific
they're kind of mediocre you can do a
lot better a meaningful goal that you
help people achieve is determined by
solving a burning problem within human
nature in the Eternal markets health
wealth relationships and happiness if
you haven't already achieved a
meaningful goal in a unique way I will
help you in another video on mastering
new skills fast until then set a goal in
one domain of your life drown yourself
in knowledge and education around it
document that knowledge as content
teaching is how you learn and identify
what you don't know so that you can
learn efficiently
this is crucial experiment with
different techniques like training
programs diets ways to make money Etc
fourth is identify the fundamentals
truths and principles between the
different techniques fifth is Achieve
the goal by creating your own way of
getting there then distribute it as a
digital product that sells while you
sleep with obscenely high profit margins
from there you have the resources which
is readership and income to build
whatever other businesses you desire now
lastly number four promotions are why
you achieve the goal people don't care
about features they care about benefits
assume that everyone is selfish because
they are even if that selfishness comes
from feeling good about themselves by
being selfless marketing is about
creating the most powerful why a why
implies a transformation Transformations
are what people want like how a physique
transformation always gets a lot of
views on YouTube or how life
Transformations get you emotionally
invested in another person a
transformation is a story and that's
what our minds are wired to be attracted
to trust and connected to so you need to
do one of two things one is tell people
why the product will change their life
two tell people why it changed your life
because they will read it as if they
were changing theirs I've been a
marketer technically for almost 6 years
now that means I've been marketing my
own products or services and here's all
you need to know in order to actually
make money a story or transformation is
composed of three things one is a
burning problem two is a desirable
outcome three is a clear solution we
talked about about this earlier this is
a perspective you're giving people a new
mind you're changing people's minds in
order to earn with your mind that's your
entire marketing campaign goal problem
path to get there in other words desired
outcome burning problem clear solution
you will have to test each one until you
strike gold with the right positioning
but then you are set for a while so for
each of those components write about
them non-stop in your short content in
order to test and validate the ideas and
then you know it will do well when you
turn it into a product or if you've
already written so much look for a high
performing goal in your content look for
a high performing problem in your
content look for a high performing
system in your content create a product
out of it it will sell those three
components will be used whenever you ask
someone to buy your product in your
emails landing page IG Story YouTube
promotion or the rest long form
promotions are like a full sales page
you have to fill up the Page by guiding
people through that structure go and
watch the introduction of this video if
you want to understand that so short
form promotions are like a call to
action in let's say an email if you've
tried the latest and greatest business
models without any success and are
considering accepting your fate at a day
job it's because you are falling for
tactics in digital economics I teach the
principles of building a purposeful
business brand content product and
promotion so you can talk about your
interests and earn a creative income you
see what I did there now when you're
writing promotions you need to
understand which part of your audience
you're talking to because if you attract
a broad audience you Niche down with
your product you don't Niche down far
with your audience you Niche down
further with your product to Target a
specific person you have to understand
how long they've been reading your
content and if they understand your
philosophy or worldview or the
importance of it because I see this
mistake often people have very high
level language like manifesting a life
of alignment to a peaceful being and
Their audience couldn't care less if you
haven't defined alignment or manifesting
to your beginner level audience which
everyone is 80% of the market are
beginners they don't understand it they
know what they know they don't know what
you're teaching them it's why you're
teaching it so if you haven't find it
then don't write it that way be
straightforward be simple be impactful
give people what they want don't give
people what you think they want that's
it for this video I hope you enjoyed
