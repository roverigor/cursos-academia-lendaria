I have a lot of
followers I love starting these videos
out with a bit of narcissism on a
serious note I I say this to frame the
conversation we're about to have because
one it's important that you learn how to
gain followers from someone that's
gained followers rather than someone who
has zero followers and you know theory
and practice you need both and you need
results as well and the thing here is I
didn't always have a large readership
and of course this is obvious but human
nature is human nature and people see
someone with a lot of followers or a lot
of Authority or just someone who we
idolize on social media or the authors
of the books that we read or just people
on TV and we assume that they've always
been like that that's who they are to us
we can't fill in the rest of the story
because most people don't have the
ability or haven't trained the ability
to zoom out and actually see that other
people are human my first attempt at
social media was as a photographer I
would post images on Instagram and just
spam hashtags and hope and pray that I
would someday gain 100,000 followers and
the reality of the situation was not
like that I posted my images I used the
hashtags I did what people told me to do
and I gained no followers and I thought
my images were at least decent compared
to the other people that were growing on
social media so obviously there was a
problem there but as shiny object
syndrome goes I eventually became more
interested in the editing side of things
right I enjoyed editing the photos more
than I enjoyed going out to take the
photos and so I spent my days binge
watching YouTube videos on tutorials for
Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Photoshop and
around this time is when I came across
this guy on Instagram named visuals of
Julius keep in mind this is like 5 years
ago and he would post these surreal
images just eye candy right something
that you love to look at it would stop
your scroll it was pictures of galaxies
and mountains and clouds that you would
never see before you knew that it was
Art right it wasn't a photo but it was
fairly realistic I wanted to do what he
did because clearly it was more like
photo editing and so my YouTube binges
continued and I borrowed some Aderall
from my roommate at the time and I would
just sit in my room with Photoshop open
just creating these images putting stock
images and my own images together
blending them I would spend 6 Seven 8
hours in my room forgetting to eat
obsessed with what I was creating and so
here's one of my favorites I'll go over
I'll show more pictures in my story
video which will be a few videos from
now I think two or three but this is
when things started to get real this is
when I started to understand how to
actually grow on social media my
beautiful images that I was now posting
meant absolutely nothing on their own I
couldn't just post and hope that our
Lord and savior the algorithm would save
me I had to get my content in front of
people I had to get my content shared by
people with larger audiences than me
when you zoom out this is the one and
only principle for social media growth
even if you're hosting X or Twitter
spaces or a podcast where someone else
is hosting you to share your spoken
content people people people eyeballs
eyeballs eyeballs I see this all the
time because I teach writing and
therefore I teach social media because
that's how you share your writing that's
how you get eyes on it kind of but you
can't just post post your writing this
is what I try to [ __ ] hammer in
people's heads is getting eyes on your
content your writing this just pisses me
off so much because people think they
can neglect that aspect there's writing
and there's people your writing will not
get seen without people and people think
they're so introverted that they can't
get in front of people you have to use
the strategies that get your writing in
front of people I just wrote something
in my notes because this came up earlier
in my head when I was at the gym and it
makes me so heated is that there are
three three things things that you need
for Success three things that you need
for Success are one what you do what do
you make what do you do is it valuable
two how many people know what you do
three is the thing that you do valuable
to the people that know what you do and
if it's not how do you make it valuable
to the people that know what you do
that's where marketing and sales comes
in and with consistency and effort and
improving the thing that you do and
increasing the amount of people that
know what you do that's
success back to the story in the digital
art world what I was making there are a
lot of curation accounts and you still
see this in like the business side of
things where it's like business mindset
on Instagram where they just share like
quotes and stuff but for Instagram art
Pages it was they were sharing other
people's art and they were growing the
page because of that and since they were
choosing the best art to post they grew
faster because they didn't really have
to create art they had a lot more
leverage to build an audience but that
doesn't necessarily equal monetization
unless the artists are paying them to
share their work and so you would only
have a chance at getting seen by these
accounts if you use their specific
hashtag like hashtag a game of tones was
an account on there or you consistently
commented on their account or you
networked with them you dm' them you Ed
strategies that I've talked about before
like the non- needing networking process
and so I was consistent at this for
around 2 months and if I remember
correctly my post got shared by a bunch
of small accounts that were trying to do
the same but maybe 10 to 20 times on
like big massive accounts that had 100K
to 500k followers that were all posting
digital art so in my first two months by
doing that and getting eyes on my
content I gained around 2500 followers
now this may not seem much like I have
now but if you've ever grown something
on social media from scratch you
understand that those first
however many followers are the hardest
you don't have any social proof you
don't have any Authority you don't have
any content built up and people just
don't like to follow people that have a
low follower count it's a heavy grind
that you have to overcome with certain
strategies when you go and look at a
person with 100 followers even if it's
the best content in the world you're
going to be like oh he probably hasn't
been doing this long enough maybe that
was a one-off post he only has 100
there's no like validation there it's
not he's not that important but when you
see someone with 100,000 they could post
something terrible and then they go to
their profile and they're like oh this
has 100,000 followers he must be
important and then they follow without
even questioning it so at this point in
my journey at500 followers I burnt out
and quit because it took so long to
create daily Photoshop composits and I
just didn't really have a vision for the
account and I didn't know marketing and
sales I didn't know how to create a
product if I would have just emulated
visuals of Julius the guy that I
originally inspired me to do this I
would have created a course just based
around my top images that I created and
showed people how to create them and
that alone wasn't would be enough to
monetize and expand from there and so
this is a lesson to artists is that when
you go and look at most artists they
usually just have a bank of tutorials
and premium tutorials as a course and
that's how they monetize and artists
think oh I have to monetize my music I
have to monetize this this and this just
start with the lwh hanging fruit like
get a product out there and monetize so
you can free up time to actually spend
refining and growing your business so
let's zoom out which is principal in my
book nice transition Dan I'm going to
promote to you guys now and sell you on
my book but the art of focus box um one
price is increasing on November 7th two
we only have 2,000 copies available now
this is a box this isn't your average
book launch it comes with the digital
version so you can you can read it only
2,000 people get to read it before it's
open to the public uh two you get cool
things like the fosy planner here's just
an example of the daily page pretty cool
Focus goals all that stuff that we talk
about in my productivity videos but
aside from that there's a lot of cool
things there's a private invitation to
annual events where Keepsake members or
Keepsake holders the people that buy the
book get to meet each other if you want
your book signed I still don't feel like
I'm cool enough to sign a book but I'll
sign your book so if you want the artof
focus box go to the first link in the
description it's just the artof focus
box.com read up on it it's expensive
obviously because there's I'm only
printing 2,000 annual events are $400
alone there's a lot in there but if you
just want the paperback hold off until
that launches after Keepsake sells out
back to the topic is that I no longer do
Photoshop art obviously I'm a writer now
and this video is a part of the digital
writer series if you haven't already
watched the last one go and watch the
last one on how to make a million
dollars as a digital writer so we will
be talking about social media growth
from that lens from the lens of writing
and if you want a primer on how to write
good content then go and watch one of
the videos in the the one person
business playlist that's called
something like how social media 101
something like that so by writing I mean
anything that is written on social media
captions Instagram posts with text on
the image tweets LinkedIn posts real
scripts YouTube scripts Etc just how you
can start writing on social media and
growing an audience without having to
post pictures of your body or images or
designs or whatever just writing social
media growth is so straightforward that
everyone over complicates it or they
don't pay attention to it at all Some
people post and post and post just to
get mad at the algorithm for not
spreading their content other people
know how to grow and they are
intelligent individuals but their posts
are like art pieces that never get
purchased the artist thinks they are the
best thing in the world but the market
couldn't care less and then there are
those that grow a bit but they don't
know how to double down on their best
ideas and continue that growth they
forget the levers that allowed them to
grow in the first place so step one from
a big picture to grow on social media is
to write persuasive content the key word
here is persuasive you have to capture
hold and deliver value on attention you
can't just write whatever you want and
expect it to capture hold and deliver
value on attention first is a hook be
mindful as to whether or not your first
sentence will grab their attention this
goes beyond just the words you use the
structure and design of the post can do
this even on X two a big problem imply
or state a problem that people can
relate to don't make it too high level
three a clear solution an actionable way
to overcome the problem preferably with
a unique way of doing so from personal
experience four is a big benefit imply
or state a desirable benefit that people
will receive from your advice five is
confidence or polarization stand firm in
your beliefs but be willing to change
them nobody wants to follow someone who
doesn't sound confident or can't choose
aside say what you want to say you will
get hate like everyone else number six
is a novel perspective or big idea this
is why reading or consuming content is
important if you can find a way of
explaining an idea that isn't normal it
will give your readers a dopamine hit
and Advance their understanding the best
way to solidify these as knowledge is to
screenshot that or save them or write
them down somewhere safe and when you
are writing make sure you check the box
of at least three to four of them at the
start and then you begin to develop the
skill and you can start to create your
own rules of the game in the next video
I'm going to be going over 10 strategies
to make your writing more engaging with
examples and a PDF but just if you
didn't know I teach all of this in to
our writer Link in the description to
check that out step number two from a
big picture to grow on social media is
to get eyes on your content so we've
discussed this and we'll discuss it more
in the next section we'll dive into the
technical details of it because it's
important but for now just nail it into
your head that your content is
meaningless unless you attempt and put
effort into getting eyes on your content
it's okay to write content into the void
for practice but eventually you have to
just get out there and start putting it
in front of of people step three is to
iterate on your ideas with data and you
can only Reach This step if you have
eyes on your content you don't know
which post of yours performs best unless
you've gotten it in front of people and
so with time month after month this is
going to take 6 months to a year as all
good things but every month review your
highest performing content just go
scroll through see which does the best
copy paste the link to another browser
or something like that and then start to
rewrite them from different angles make
some short make some long make some list
make some the big idea make a better
hook make a more clear big problem make
a certain actionable list things like
that and so this is how you gradually
sustain an increase in engagement over
time it's how you increase your Baseline
of the persuasiveness and impact of your
writing it's not about just writing
whatever you want it's about iterating
on the best ideas that your audience
actually likes that points to a product
that you should create with that
specific angle you can create whatever
product you want but you need the angle
that performs best in order to catch
attention and actually sell it and then
that's how you just do better and better
with your writing over time on social
media step four and this is down the
road a bit but you want to create depth
with your best ideas depth and span that
is you can do well on one platform like
X or Twitter or really anything but
eventually you either choose to become a
slave to that platform or you diversify
another thing here is that modern power
belongs to those who hold the most
attention in their lifetime this is
another lesson from my book in The
Vessel chapter where I talk about the
one person business just the shift in
education skill acquisition the best
skills to learn Etc a short post that
holds 10 seconds of attention is nothing
compared to a video podcast or
newsletter that holds 15 to 60 Minutes
of attention you must take your best
ideas from the last part and turn them
into longer form content this is how you
get your name spread without you trying
this is how you build the roots of your
brand deep into the collective psyche
this is how you build trust and
Authority orders of magnitude higher
than those who only post short content
this is why you will almost always
attribute the results in your life to a
book or an author who taught you how
rather than someone you saw post about
the same idea on Twitter when you see
someone post about habits on Twitter I
bet 90% of you that have read Atomic
Habits by James clear a good book will
think of James CLE you won't even
attribute the idea to the person that
wrote the short piece of content you're
giving the authority to someone else
because they chose to write long form
okay so now let's talk about actually
get getting eyes on your content AKA
traffic mechanisms of every single
social media so now that you're
hopefully writing and posting content it
helps to understand the mechanics of the
social media game when you understand
how these traffic mechanisms allow you
to grow just understanding social media
in general then you get to pick and
choose and create a strategy that works
best for your growth test them all and
see what works don't fall for the Trap
of social media gurus telling you one is
any better than the other because the
the algorithm changed that's always the
thing is that's the hot topic of the day
is always the algorithm the algorithm
the algorithm it's like dude I can post
the same [ __ ] content I I don't even
have to post reals anymore I don't have
to post anything because I understand
human nature I want I understand what's
going to capture or hold and generate
attention I don't need the algorithm to
share my content when I'm in direct
control of it and once you learn the
skills that allow you to be in direct
control of it you don't have to worry
about being a slave to the algorithm
always having to study the latest and
greatest tactics and never being able to
develop a system or feel to your brand
when you go to my Instagram page there's
an obvious feel other people that are
posting memes and then when you slide to
the Carousel and there's a video right
now there's nothing there you're not
really creating anything it just shows
that you're hopping on the bandwagon so
the first traffic mechanism to get eyes
on your content and profile so you can
actually grow is replies this is the
most obvious one that everyone does and
everyone tells you to do because it's
low hanging fruit and you have to do it
the the when you comment under
somebody's post there are people that go
and read the comments of that post and
if your comment captures holds and
delivers value on attention to the point
where they click on your profile see
what you do and follow you that's how
you can start to gain followers but
there are a few things that people miss
here one is that boring content doesn't
make people read the replies I see
people reply to boring posts all day
long and get a few Impressions on their
replies then they wonder what went wrong
think about this if you if you like a a
tweet can get 10 billion likes and only
100 people go into the replies because
there's nothing sparking controversy or
conversation so they're not going to go
into the replies you can reply to high
engaging tweets all day but since you
can't think deeper and you don't
understand social media you're not going
to grow and then you're going to be like
okay what's happening like I'm doing
what Dan told me to do and nothing's
happening number two is that boring
replies don't make people click on your
profile stop repeating what was said in
the original post talk about yourself
tell people how you've experienced the
same thing in your life talking about
yourself leads to the most profile
clicks number three is small accounts
get fewer Impressions overall it's good
to reply and network with Accounts at
your size but don't think it will help
you grow by much that's fine you should
still do it just be sure you are
replying to the bigger accounts with
interesting content now not only does
replies help you increase your followers
just Spam replies go reply to everyone
you need to get your name in people's
Mouse you need to get your name known
over the course of months this isn't a
one-day thing where you're going to gain
$100 followers this is compounding
nature where I see someone in the
replies multiple times over the course
of a month and I'm like oh there's that
guy again there's that guy again maybe I
should DM him maybe I should follow him
maybe oh he's replying to this other guy
that I really like too oh and then the
creators actually start to notice you if
they spend time in the replies and
things just get better when you reply
with a personal story so people trust
you more so traffic mechanism number two
is quote posts quote posts are when
someone reposts your content with some
form of commentary so on X this is
obvious the feature is called repost or
quote post and it it takes their post it
gives you somewhere to type above it and
then you write something you write a
tweet that's engaging that captures
holds delivers value on attention and
not only does the Creator see that and
can possibly retweet it which is or
repost it which is traffic to your
profile and the thing here is it's it's
the same on Instagram where someone can
share your post to their story or you
can share their post to your story with
commentary and tag them so they see it
but the thing here is is like you think
you can just post something and be like
oh this is great there there's no reason
for them to repost it and even if they
do just for validation to show that they
know what they're talking about to Their
audience other people aren't going to
click on your profile it's boring people
aren't going to read it there's nothing
of value there again talk about yourself
learn how to write persuasive content
and do not not write persuasive content
in every single situation you're in on
social media I don't care if you're in
the DMs I don't care if you're writing
your own post I don't care if you're in
the replies I don't care if you're in a
quot post I don't care if you're in an
email I don't care if you're in a
YouTube video I don't care if you're
[ __ ] anywhere be persuasive at any
given moment you have to transfer your
Consciousness to your reader and
understand are they going to read this
are they going to continue reading this
are they going to click off now there
are nuances with all of these this is
why I say test them all over the course
of 6 to 12 months because this one is
more like a numbers game and luck
because if you're aiming so big with
someone you're trying to repost quote
post someone on X with 500,000 followers
they're probably not going to see it and
if they do it's just by dumb luck and
then they may retweet it but you have to
be very conscious of what you're doing
on social media here if you're going to
do some quote posts make sure it's
targeted and actually worth your time so
the third traffic mechanism for growing
on social media is reposts so this is
obvious it's just repost on X or share
on YouTube or share on Facebook
or repost on Tik Tok I don't know how it
goes or on uh Instagram it's like you
can repost the actual post to your page
but it's usually just sharing to your
story and the thing here is is that your
content has to be good enough and
sharable enough for people to share to
their feed what does that mean one they
have to identify or resonate with what
you're actually posting so you need to
think when you're actually writing are
people going to retweet this or repost
this and why why would I repost this why
do you repost things self-awareness here
when I repost something it's usually
because I want my audience to see what
it is that I agree with or resonate with
right so if I'm just reading a post I'm
not going to share it to my feed because
my friends are going to see it right
someone's not going to retweet you if
they don't want their friends to see
what they like so that's the thing is
you have to just pay attention here to
what you're writing to make sure it's
relatable and it catches and holds
attention and it's something that they
want to spread it's something they want
to identify with or be known for so
always think before hitting post will
people share it why should they share it
do I identify with anything I'm saying
is it polarizing enough to spark
discussion and get comments and boost
engagement further the fourth traffic
mechanism is just manual DMS this one is
more difficult and slow but I highly
recommend networking in general to help
grow your account that's also a strategy
to get reposts and other things of that
nature we'll talk about that in a bit
but you can also go watch the non- needy
networking process video and of course
like DMS work best when you're not a
corporate robot like most people are on
LinkedIn nobody wants to receive a
message like hey great to connect I love
your stuff we should have a virtual
coffee and talk about the complexity of
Zap your automations to enhance the
overall experience of your loyal email
subscribers so that you can build an
incredible digital presence you can make
friends online to the point where
they're happy to just share whatever you
you ask them to share and another thing
here is that like I'm just teaching I'm
teaching this as a traffic mechanism
where like you can do lead generation in
the DMS for your products or services
but obviously there's diminishing
returns there where your effort is much
better spent when you're selling a high
ticket service when you're doing cold
Outreach because that's a lot of time
invested and the the payoff is a lot
better where if I can sell a $2,500
service with a decent amount of DMS it's
going to take a while
that's better than me sending that same
amount of DMS to sell like a $150
product and it's obviously better than
me sending the same amount of DMS for
one impression on my post if I treat my
post as my offer in the DMS because
technically a post is an offer that and
the conversion the conversion of that
offer is engagement but you get the
point so now let's get into how to
actually control your growth on any
platform if you are smart you can use
the traffic mechanisms that we just
discussed in a creative way to control
your growth those are literally the only
tools that you can use to grow your
following if you want actual followers
right so step one to controlling how you
grow is understanding short form to long
form this is like the main teaching of
2hour writer and how I teach to start
long form or even with a book like me
writing and outlining the book shaped
every single newsletter I wrote shaped
every single tweet I wrote etc etc but
short form platforms like X or Instagram
or LinkedIn are inherent cently more
easier to grow at least at the start
than something like YouTube or podcast
or medium that require some search
engine optimization and just a slow
buildup over time uh like on YouTube I
don't think people are going to really
care about you until you have at least
50 videos same goes with a podcast and
the search engine for a podcast is just
absolute trash so instead my strategy
was always this I failed at YouTube a
while ago like after the digital art
stuff and once I got on X or Twitter and
started writing it kind of just made
sense it's like okay this is a bit
easier to grow I'm more in control of
the traffic mechanisms here why don't I
build here and then transfer my audience
over to YouTube podcast Etc so I get
eyes on that content eyes again in your
audience's eyes and so this is a route
that actually makes sense one for people
that just don't have the resources or
equipment or speaking skills or whatever
to start YouTube and actually grow right
now you can practice that on the side
while you get good at writing and
actually grow an account and while I
said short form isn't as potent as long
form because it doesn't hold as much
attention that doesn't mean that you
neglect the benefits of a short form so
number two for taking control of your
social media growth is curation quotes
and remixing DJs and producers grow by
remixing popular songs so they can steal
the traffic from that popular song and
so you may see this on Instagram a bit I
see it all the time where a DJ will
remix a popular song like how Crank That
remixed uh I forget what song by Taylor
Swift and it just went viral and it
brought a lot of traffic to him because
he was banking off of the back of Taylor
Swift's Authority you see this on
YouTube as well when people make a video
about someone else who is popular
they're taking the traffic of people
that are going to watch that specific
person or in a podcast this is why
people bring big guests on a podcast so
they can grow that audience and this was
also a similar case when I was doing
digital art I could take their image
remix it post it tag them they share it
I leverage Their audience and grow
that's a repost or a quote post or
however they decide to share it traffic
mechanism so the same is true for
writers as well you can quote them in a
thread or newsletter use their ideas in
your longer post to illustrate a point
then DM them the post saying that you
mention them they may repost it without
you asking two is to commentate on their
content similar to how YouTubers make
reaction videos to leverage the traffic
that the larger Creator is getting third
you can get people on a podcast because
people just love getting on podcasts
this is how you can get exposed to a
larger Creator's audience they will
share the podcast to have their audience
watch or listen there are a lot more
benefits to starting a podcast than just
becoming a podcaster you can use it as a
way to network and meet bigger people
that you can befriend and actually get
to know on the podcast and then you have
that connection with them and can ask
them for something in the future it's
not just about like growing the podcast
that's what I did when I had a guest
podcast two years ago the fourth is to
talk about their ideas and credit them a
simple post where you say the best idea
I've seen this week then go on to
explain how it impacted you and credit
the original author they could share you
they could comment they could do
whatever that will get eyes on that
content and this also stresses the
importance of long form and short form
together because for some of these it's
difficult to just do in a post obviously
in a podcast you can't but even in like
a newsletter sharing someone's quote and
slowly helping other people spread their
name so they'll help you spread your
name the third strategy for controlling
your growth is paid growth and this is
where it gets very touchy people who are
quote unquote super authentic and moral
and Noble who also have zero experience
with social media love to say how
authentic and moral they are for not
using paid growth strategies I've
observed these people over the years and
four years down the road they've either
not grown at all or lost followers
people don't like like bitter
complainers who stop focusing on
providing value and pushing a more
holistic worldview now here I'm not
talking about running ads to gain
followers that's the worst thing you can
do and I see people losing hundreds of
followers a day because they did that on
Twitter or Instagram or wherever it is
you're just don't do anything that
requires something or someone else to
tell people to follow you just get eyes
on your content that's all I'm talking
about here I'm also not talking about
Instagram shoutouts where people post
you to the the page and you do all this
stupid [ __ ] like oh I like a stupid
viral thing where you're like I started
in Amazon FBA company and grew to a
million dollars in 5 seconds and then
and then the caption is just like follow
account follow account follow account
follow account it's like that doesn't
work I've seen it time and time again it
does not [ __ ] work four loyal
followers that is I've some I've seen
some people have success with it for
like quick churn and burn clients but
you're not nurturing the audience you're
not capturing the attention you're not
allowing people to follow you because
they want to follow you you're not
nurturing the audience and holding more
attention over time you're not building
trust what I'm talking about is a truly
authentic post one that you would
normally write and using a bit of money
to get it in front of other people's
eyes good content is obviously a
prerequisite here because the common
thing is like oh my gosh like you you're
only growing
because because you paid for growth and
like I don't do this anymore more I
tried it at the beginning and it works
because my content was good but that's
the thing is like if you have crappy
content someone reposting you like it
it's not going to do you much good like
to me this is a better way of doing paid
ads where you're just letting people
follow you this is a 10 times better way
than doing paid ads like I truly don't
get the people that like talk [ __ ] about
this strategy and then they go and run
paid ads and have to use all of these
like sleazy direct response principles
it's like think about it like this
right I write a piece of content I pay
someone that I know that I normally
wouldn't have been able to get a hold of
they offer it as a service I go I pay
them one I get to network with that
bigger person I ask hey can you help me
I I want to leverage your audience
something like that not that direct but
then they repost my content they don't
tell people to follow me they don't do
anything they just repost it there's no
ad there's no sponsored [ __ ] thing
there that turns people off people that
like the post like the post people that
want to follow they follow over time I
nurture them in my audience then
eventually if they want to buy a product
or service they can to me that's 10
times more authentic than literally any
other kind of paid growth and the other
thing here is that just reality is Harsh
large accounts are busy and probably
won't do this AKA they won't share you
unless you pay them because they need a
filter if they're getting hundreds of
DMS a day they're not going to spend 24
hours a day responding to DMS they they
need something they have other things to
do that led to those DMS you need to
offer payment for them to pay attention
to you if you don't like that don't
start a business if you don't start a
business enjoy the other side which is
10 times more corrupt this isn't unfair
it's just reality and you don't have the
mind or experience to understand that so
A few things that you can do with this
strategy is you can ask them to repost
you it's just as simple as reposting or
sharing to the story again no caption no
asking to follow you or you can ask them
to reply to you because again people get
so up in arms about what is the best
strategy based on the current algorithm
or repost better or replies better or
whatever better if you think replies are
better then ask them to reply to you for
however much money instead of reposting
you and this really only works on a
platform like Twitter or X like on
Instagram the replies don't boost you on
the other person's feed on X if someone
replies to you their followers still see
so just DM them ask them if they help
with growing your brand and then take
the conversation further and see what
they offer in terms of who I don't know
figure it out test it waste a bit of
money and I've I've heard so many
objections about this strategy but like
the other thing is if you think it's
fine for advertisers to promote a
product randomly in your face then I
don't see why you shouldn't think it's
fine for creators to accept money to
share content that you'll probably like
without you asking to buy anything
that's the other thing is that the
content that people share isn't so
position in directly trying to sell you
on something than an ad that already
pops up randomly on your feet like oh no
something pops up random randomly on my
feed that I may like and I did oh no I
didn't know that someone was paid to
share
it now again we're getting touchier is
strategy number four to Growing is a
mastermind harsh truth every Creator you
know is in a group chat with other
creators they talk strategy and have fun
building businesses together they also
share each other's posts and help them
grow they use the traffic mechanisms to
create a strategy they can bake into
their routine some groups comment on
each other's posts each morning others
repost the posts that they share in the
group most of all they form a tribe and
start to identify as a part of a group
you can notice that there are tribes of
5 to 10 creators that all talk to each
other online this is why so the other
thing here is that people call these
engagement groups they call them
whatever I like to call them a
mastermind because that is a pattern in
reality is that shared minds work better
than a singular mind they can build
better together they can grow Better
Together etc etc Napoleon Hill I believe
I think that was him had the concept of
a mastermind which is just a shared mind
working towards a singular goal you
don't have to think of these as just
superficial transactions of sharing each
other's content you can make it deeper
than that you can actually meet people
that become lifelong friends you don't
have to go about this alone and just
swear off anything that you may think is
authentic because your mind is so closed
and [ __ ] narrow sorry for getting
heated I've I've been doing this for 3
to four years I've seen every objection
in the book and it's frankly very
annoying so the thing with this is yes
you're going to have to DM people yes
you're you're going to have to develop
some social skills yes you're going to
have to disidentify with your
misinterpretation of what an introvert
is so that you can actually achieve
something great in your future another
thing is that this is a long-term game
like you're allowed to leave groups when
you don't feel it's right if it is that
superficial transaction of oh you share
this post I'll share this post and you
don't care about anyone in there then
yeah leave go and form a new one like
iterate on everything in business and
last thing is that you will not see
insane results in less than a year and
even if you do it's wise to not think
that you will like that expectation most
of the time won't match with reality
come time and it's not going to feel
good so don't hold that expectation
that's it for this one I hope this
actually helped uh I don't apologize for
being a bit harsh but that's the reality
of the social media game you either
learn to play or you don't and the other
thing here is that like none of this
ever in my entire social media career
has seemed like as dark or inauthentic
as people make it seem like if someone
makes a video about like oh here's what
influencers do to XYZ and they just
frame it as the most evil thing in the
world it it's not like that it's just
reality it's a great thing it it's it's
a really good thing it's actually
changed my life it's changed who I'm
building a business with right now
almost everything in my life clearly
over the the past 4 years would not have
been possible without any of this and
the people's lives not to sound like
narcissistic or self-rising here again
but like the people's lives that have
changed they wouldn't have been changed
like without these strategies or without
knowing this so even if some may even if
you don't have the ideas to connect to
understand that these things aren't
unethical in the grand scheme of things
like this this is what you have to do to
grow it it's like if you don't have the
authority of someone who already has all
of the eyes if you're just starting out
and you're using social media as a
beginner to build your Authority this is
what you're going to have to do lastly I
talk about all of this really in the art
of focus I talk about everything that I
talked about in my videos uh so Link in
the description to get the keepsake box
again it comes with a really fancy
planner so you can get that inside the
box that's it peace
