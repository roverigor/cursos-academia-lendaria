everyone wants to be a content creator
and this isn't a bad thing especially if
you can predict where the future of work
is going Boomers will tell you to get a
real job when those real jobs won't
exist in a few decades they don't
realize that the Industrial Age created
those jobs they also don't realize that
the information age has created these
new and more profitable jobs
profitability determines the direction
of society and the economy technology
allows for more profitable lines of work
the Creator economy is projected to in
size from 250 billion to 480 billion
over the next 5 years and I personally
with what I've experienced in the space
and of course it being a part of my
identity so I'm somewhat biased I only
see that increasing exponentially more
and more and more if you haven't watched
my previous videos on just the Creator
economy the future of work one person
business you'll understand what I'm
saying when everyone is a Creator
employers are hiring creators creators
are working under creators to get
experience creators are self sufficient
in the products that they create to
solve the real problems of humanity
problems that they've experienced that's
the problem with most businesses is they
try to solve a problem that they haven't
experienced and that's why the
businesses fail Creator brand or your
personal brand is your public resume
public portfolio it's just you placing
your character online if you think of
digital reality as a more expanded and
inclusive version of physical reality
your personal brand is the character
within that reality and this is a very
real thing because we spend so much of
Our Lives on these apps and we're just
waiting to go into the screen until it
actually happens with future technology
the big problem is a lack of
understanding people don't understand
what the content creation is from a big
picture point of view there's a reason
everyone feels the poll to become a
content creator because it's human
because people want to do what they want
because people have an innate drive to
pursue their curiosity become a vessel
for value and create with their own two
hands you know the things that schools
and jobs stripped from you because when
you peel back the layers that's what the
Natural Evolution of humanity has been
pointing at this entire time since the
dawn of time we've been solving problems
with technology to rid ourselves of
robotic and time-consuming labor work so
we can pursue self-actualization and
Transcendence let's define what both
content and creation are content the
things that are held or included in
something in other words everything is
content content is structured
information information is how we learn
grow and adapt as a species information
is what occupies our mind shapes our
mind and comes out of our mind we use
the structure of our psyche to create
content the front end of the internet is
content the front end of your mind is
content the back end of the internet is
code the back end of your mind is code
so if your psyche is a complex set of
systems or your mind is a complex set of
systems like a computer you can think of
the words you speak or write or
communicate like the media that that is
on the front end of the internet every
single thing you see on the
internet so when you meld the two
together you get content creation
creation to bring into existence that's
what humans do they create they solve
problems they build solutions that is
your Edge that is what a human does and
the humans that don't do that are the
robots or cogs in the machine of society
to be human is to expand transcend and
create to be robotic is to forget that
you have this gift and allow your mind
to mold to the whims of others with
schooling and employment at its root
content creation is just being human not
a robot as outdated jobs would have you
believe everyone is a content creator
some just choose to do it with intention
and get paid to do so in a place called
the internet where physical boundaries
don't limit your reach and potential
content creation is how you make your
writing and speaking more valuable
because you must first become valuable
enough as an individual to contribute to
and profit from the global digital digal
Community like our ancestors did their
local physical Community now we need to
understand that content creation is not
a job or a business it is a magnet let's
start by just bringing things back down
to Earth because it's fun to talk
philosophically and abstractly all the
time but now that we have that in place
what I'm going to talk about won't lose
its zest or impact in business you need
two things to make money one is people
business is value exchange and if you
want money you need someone else to give
it to you in exchange for something of
equal value this is a big problem is
that people just don't realize that you
need a person to give you money you can
invest all day long but how did you get
the money to invest from a person the
second thing is a product a product
Services included is a valuable creation
physical or digital that preferably
solves a real problem in someone's life
there's more Nuance to this of course
just like learning how to Market and
sell and the technical skills of all of
these things but you absolutely need
people and a product that's it's not
optional everything falls under that so
that's the first thing that we need to
understand content is how you attract
people to your product as a Creator now
how do you create content that attracts
people to your product by deconstructing
your mind and sharing its best parts on
the internet most people struggle when
they begin writing because they water
down everything they say or they try to
over complicate it here's exactly what
you need to write content that attracts
people like you first is relatable
topics being a content creator is still
new people are still applying old
business and marketing tactics hoping
that Their audience will grow large
people like to just scream that the
riches or in the niches but I feel like
people don't understand what that
actually means in this modern business
sense we'll talk about that in the next
video on the anti- niche or why becoming
nicheless makes you Irreplaceable I feel
like most people misinterpret what
niching down actually means and what if
I decide that I want to build a massive
audience and create a niche that way
nobody can compete with me if they made
the same amount of money I would rather
have a 3 million follower audience than
a 10,000 follower audience the former
gives you an obsene amount of unseen
leverage flexibility and options the
latter is probably three clients away
from feeling like their survival is at
stake so write Broad in your content and
narrow down to your expertise across
your content funnel your top of funnel
social media account should include
topics that people are actively
searching for and studying like
productivity psychology mindset
freelancing skill acquisition business
Etc because people actually want to
follow and learn about those things
don't get all crazy on your front end
like the top of funnel like Twitter
account with automated response
mechanisms for e-commerce stores that's
fine and like please just hold your
objections until the next video because
I'm going to handle all of these and
it's going to be a very long video
because there's a lot that goes into the
simple advice of niching down educate
people from your social media to
newsletter to podcast and let your
product page be the final piece to to
prove your Authority and Niche down as
far as you want to go people forget that
a landing page is content it's static
content if you have a link to it in your
bio then you don't need to write about
that content and this strategy of go
going broad to create a niche will
require you to have a series of low
ticket products leading to a high ticket
product if you only have like a high
tick freelancing service that's very
specific for a very specific person then
you're going to have to go about a
different strategy and you're not in my
eyes taking the best long-term move
towards a future with more freedom in it
that is if you're going to go the more
targeted route and manual approach to
Landing clients versus letting your ego
go letting it go and building an
audience that is Broad lets you talk
about what you want lets you pivot
within it and let you create a ladder to
a higher ticket service and that entire
ladder educates and creates the
customers for the higher ticket service
number two of writing content is
impactful ideas your posts sentences
paragraphs and and words will not hit if
you don't pick a side if you stand in
the middle people may like you kind of
but you're not going to impact them
impact equals writing words so powerful
that they live in their head rentree it
occupies their attention even when their
attention is off of your content they
tell their friends and co-workers about
your ideas because they want to
strengthen the shared extreme beliefs
that they have to feel validated you
write with impact when you
wholeheartedly pick a side and express
your beliefs now what are the best
beliefs to express
the ones that the average person would
think are extreme or crazy we don't want
people that are dedicated to being
average following us your beliefs form
the foundation and the perception of
your brand talk about them often and use
them as a way to provide perspective
experience and examples in most of your
content do you think freelancing is the
best beginner way to make money do you
think vegans are dumb and people should
eat more animal-based foods do you think
people should wake up at 3:00 a.m. and
get straight into work your goal is to
be 90% liked and 10% disliked if you
don't maintain that polarity with your
audience like you would in a thriving
relationship with a significant other
you give people no reason to actually
care about you you need the push pull
patterns of the universe the sun rises
the sun sets waves go up and down songs
have highs and lows it's just the nature
of reality and your mind and interacting
with other Minds with a shared
perspective is no different because this
isn't writing advice this is spiritual
advice make your writing raw Punchy and
digestible remove and replace words that
make you sound less confident write with
impact but be open to changeing your
mind when somebody presents you with a
better perspective in the replies have
firm beliefs held Loosely now the third
thing with writing content is novel
perspectives most people regurgitate the
same ideas they never provide a new way
of looking at things novel perspectives
are the main way to provide a good
dopamine hit that aids in learning
understanding and action most creators
dish out dopamine like candy in hopes
that they build a loyal readership you
create novel perspectives through
hunting in the unknown you hunt in the
unknown through personal experience
pursuing your own goals and
self-reflection and researching
information in the depths of books
podcasts articles and social media
accounts people don't want just another
idea they want a unique point of view
like the intro of this video add to stop
and think about the idea that I wanted
to convey and pair personal experience
with philosophical ideas that shaped my
worldview take your topics beliefs and
novel perspectives you acquire over time
to craft writing that holds attention
without annoying tactics the fourth
thing for writing content is writing
structure you can have the greatest
ideas in the world but you have to pay
attention to where you posting them when
people are reading a book they're okay
with blocks of text when people are on
social media that's completely different
they need to be guided throughout your
writing or else they'll scroll past your
post to another post that catches their
attention use LINE breaks go and look at
any of my posts and notice how I add
line breaks between sentences to
increase readability Study High
performing posts structures look at
popular X posts IG posts YouTube titles
and article headlines write more lists
bullet lists open a curiosity Loop
people can like share follow or comment
based on any bullet in your list list
force you to condense each bullet to be
impactful people will add their own
thoughts or Nuance in the comments
boosting reach because of this anything
can be turned into a list go hunt for an
idea and try to turn it into a list of
lessons benefits pains or steps when I
was coming up with this video I had to
create a post like an hour from when I
was actually writing the thing so I went
to find an idea real quick the idea was
10 habits that changed my life and that
was from a medium.com article headline
so here's the post I actually wrote for
X how to clear your mind walk more read
more write more listen more lift more
strategize more build more scroll less
indulge less criticize less ruminate
less sit less procrastinate less Clarity
is reserved for those who don't resist
reality but engage with it and now I
could have put all of those in a bullet
point that's what I mean by lists like
when you go and look at a post and it
has uh how to clear your mind bullet
bullet bullet bullet bullet I could have
done that but uh Twitter has this thing
now where it just cuts it off at the end
so decided not to space it out like that
but if I had a shorter list then I would
include bullet points for the benefits I
mentioned before the general post
structure here is just hook body being
the list of reasons benefits lessons
pains and then conclusion now the fifth
thing with content creation is eyes and
effort most creators make the massive
mistake of actually caring about the
algorithm and latest trends they lack an
understanding of what the algorithm is
actually based on which is human
Understanding Psychology and mechanics
the principles of each of these is
having a desired outcome a burning
problem and a clear solution or system
when you nail each one of those in your
content people will share it if they
don't share it then you aren't as good
of a writer as you think you are you
need more data testing and
experimentation with your writing beyond
that creators realize that the algorithm
will get people to see their content so
they can grow but don't realize they can
control the amount of people that see
their content you have to put effort
into your growth especially as a
beginner by replying to larger accounts
that have an audience to see your
replies and follow you networking with
creators to help each other and
potentially paying for help I break all
of these down in my video how to build
an audience with zero followers we
understand at least the basics of
content creation but now we need to
understand that you need a product that
you would actually buy and use if you
don't sell your own product you will be
assigned one to sell without lying to
yourself create a product that you would
actually buy use and benefit from there
aren't many shortcuts in business but
this is one of them when you are the
niche you don't need to excessively
worry about market research product
Market fit or crafting the perfect
marketing strategy building an audience
is a modern cheat code your content is
how you test ideas that will turn into
your marketing that's how you know it
works if I wanted to post 10 Tweets in a
day to test 10 different YouTube titles
or the text of a thumbnail or something
related to that I know how to structure
it in a post so that it will read well
and it will get retweeted and then based
on which one gets more engagement I can
use that as a YouTube title I haven't
done this but I've seen people do it
with Facebook ads and they just run 10
ads at a time to see which gets more
clicks on the thumbnail that they are
going to use when they launch the
podcast about a year ago I wrote a
thread on X that broke down how I write
articles and newsletters in a way that
can be repurposed into content across
all platforms it did very well so I
turned it into my two-hour writer course
your audience is more trusting of you
since they've been exposed to a lot of
your content you don't need to have the
perfect conversion centered landing page
and copyrighting because people already
know if they are going to buy you've
raised their level of awareness around
their problems over time with your
content your Landing or sales page for
your product is just the final kicker
that provides Clarity when I was a
freelancer relying on cold DMS cold
emails and referrals I was pretty
neurotic about having to have everything
optimized on my website in my funnel
everything like that every time I sent
an email I felt like I had to make the
most of it like I I was just so stressed
because every single one of my actions
it had so much on the line I didn't have
any breathing room and so if I had an
audience that would solve a lot of the
problems because my marketing is done
every single day without me even
marketing it's just content that
educates others that builds trust with
you so when you have a product that will
genuinely help them they're more open to
buy it and any optimization after that
point on your landing pages or just
Marketing in general that's a bonus now
there are two routes that people will
tell you to go here which is to not
monetize when you start or to monetize
when you start I'm in the lad Camp to
monetize when you start on social media
without any followers because one you
need a way to build Authority the people
that are saying wait until like build
something off social media and then come
on social media and start monetizing
they don't realize that social media is
a perfectly viable way to build
Authority and wealth in today's world
it's not that you need experience before
you come on social media it's that you
build experience on social media it
didn't used to be this way but social
media is arguably the most viable way to
start a business nowadays so if you're
an absolute beginner you want to use the
build teach earn method to do this I had
quite a few skills in a freelancing
business under my belt before starting
as a Creator and this method helped me
succeed much faster it bakes in in every
single thing you need to earn a living
as a Creator step one is to build to
learn high value skills to earn with the
best way to learn is to self-educate so
you have knowledge as you build
something tangible so you have
experience few content creators realize
that most businesses are the same
nowadays they're all content companies
they're all media companies they all
have content or media they acquire
customers online with a brand content
product and promotions meaning if you
can learn the skills that make your
creator business a success you can can
use those skills to offer other
businesses in the form of a freelance
service or digital product every single
skill it takes to build a Creator
business is a high value skill that
everyone is talking about because if
you're running an entire business as one
person which is a Creator business and
you need to understand a vast array of
knowledge to make it work like you can't
just understand your one skill that you
want to monetize you need to understand
every single skill that makes a business
work your creator business is a business
learn graphic design as you build your
profile picture Banner website images
thumbnails Etc learn copywriting and
content writing as you build your
landing pages website social media
content and newsletters learn social
media yes it's a skill to build your
following Network and Authority learn
marketing and sales as you build your
product or service learn advertising and
promotions as you promote your products
or services to get buyers there's more
to this but every single business at
least the ones that we care about that
will be profitable in the future depends
on top of funnel which is social media
platforms like X Instagram YouTube
LinkedIn Etc middle of funnel which is
newsletter lead magnets direct messages
and any other way of nurturing your
readers then bottom of funnel which is
products Services upsells downsells Etc
I would encourage you to slowly learn
every single skill that it takes to
build a Creator business start with
writing that is what generates the most
traffic and followers and sets the
foundation of your entire brand which is
content you can improve by practicing
what we talked about above or what I've
talked about in various previous videos
or you can skip the trial and error and
just buy to our writer it's like
condensed version that's my writing
system that's what I do every morning
when you have traffic and followers you
can actually sell your products or
services or you can charge high prices
to other businesses because their main
problem is traffic and leads so step two
in the build teach earn method is to
teach to enhance your learning and build
an audience the second best way to learn
is to teach what you know what you're
learning and what you've done to achieve
a profitable or meaningful goal when you
teach something you will struggle a lot
people struggle to teach teach and they
start to think I'm not good enough and
you'd be correct you aren't neither is
anyone but rather than seeing it as the
problem of just feeling like you don't
know enough see it as an opportunity to
actually learn those things and fill the
holes in your knowledge that's what
teaching does is it reveals the gaps in
your knowledge so that you can actually
learn something people write off this
opportunity as oh I'm not good enough
when it is literally the only
opportunity to learn and solidify that
learning staring you in the face so to
write content teach your skill set teach
your mindset try to make sense of
complex ideas from your point of view
and teach about your polarizing beliefs
like everyone should be a carnivore and
why not only does teaching build
Authority but it turns you into a value
Creator if value equals positive
behavior change then most creators
aren't valuable when you start a micro
education business like I talk about in
the micro education business model video
disguised as a content creator you set
yourself up for hyper profitability the
third step in the build teach earn
method is to earn by helping others with
what you've learned by this point let's
say you've built up a valuable social
media following of 5 to 10,000 followers
you are fully qualified to help people
with your skill set because most people
don't have those results most Company
accounts don't have 5 to 10,000
followers and I'm not just talking about
helping people build a following here
I'm talking about everything that's led
to it because you have a vast array of
knowledge that you can single in on one
problem that a business is facing and
that's what you'd call a niche so to say
or just the specific problem that you
solve as a business and you use your
skill set to do that in a unique
Irreplaceable way so let's say you've
learned content writing thread writing
profile design email opin pages and
newsletter writing I've literally seen
people over the past week that have seen
some success writing long form posts on
X and they created a how I write long
form post course or Consulting they're
Consulting people for $300 to $500 an
hour and they've been making good money
for their follower size and they can do
it because they have results with long
form and it leading to a spefic specific
amount of growth if you target a company
it's like hey I'm going to I want to
write long form content for you if you
have a persuasive marketing message that
might actually work because if you're
good at writing long form posts and
those long form posts build more trust
than short form posts they lead people
down the page more they lead to more
conversions like you can see the
marketing strategy T start to um come
into play here and the long form post is
your unique mechanism it's like why
people are obsessed with intermittent
fasting when it comes to dieting because
it's just something unique that is
structured and brings clarity to the
mind as to what's going to get results
so at this point I just recommend
starting small don't try to create some
insane offer that you can charge $1 to
$220,000 for figure out what area you
have become best at and don't over
complicate it if you've gotten results
with threads or long form posts create a
product or service around that if you're
great at profile and content design
create a product or service around that
if your focus is off the charts with
your productivity system create a
product or service around that if you've
done it and it's helped your business
that means it can help help someone else
who struggles in that area the main
thing standing in the way here is
marketing and sales like understanding
how to create and form the perception of
the offer that you are handing out to
the world so if you want to understand
that more watch the video on value
creation the single skill that built my
solo business and since you're doing
this since now you're actually selling
something you have a way to actually
learn marketing and sales so it's not
Marketing sales comes before this it's
put something terrible not terrible like
in terms of quality in terms of
marketing something that is just not
going to get many buyers and then learn
along the way and fill the gaps in your
marketing message so that you actually
start making sales that's how you're
going to gain experience in this stuff
you get better at social media by
experimenting with techniques like
thread writing post structures
Mastermind groups Etc until you learn
how to get results right now sell the
technique not the skill so step 3.5 and
the build teach earn method is just an
equally viable route because as of right
now I've told you to package up and sell
business and marketing Services because
that's what is helping build your
business and they're very beginner
friendly like you don't need to be an
expert in any specific topic or interest
before you can start practicing these
things and eventually you're going to
need those skills either way to build
your business and sell whatever it is
you actually want to sell whether it be
like a fitness product or a spirituality
product or really anything you can think
of so if you're just starting out in
life and you haven't achieved any goal
or solved any problem in your life or
don't have any interests or don't have
any skills then do what I just said in
step three you can and should create a
product or service to launch and sell at
least every quarter for 2 to 3 years
don't take that lightly yes it is a lot
and why I'm saying this is because
you're going to sell one thing and then
a quarter or half a year later I want
you to create something new from a new
found place of experience so that it
sells better and the more you do this
the more it compounds I have sold
something new every quarter I've
launched it every quarter and every
single time I've seen an exponential
leap and not only my authority but my my
audience growth of course my sales and
that's the exact difference I've noticed
between myself and other accounts who
make one tenth of the progress in that
time it's because I once I have an idea
for something new because evolution is
automatic like the people that prevent
their personal evolution is themselves
so if you lean into that and you know I
have to build something new if I want to
get to the next level then you build
something new every single quarter
because building forces you to evolve
and learn creating a new product isn't
just creating a new product it's
creating a new identity with the skill
set and mindset you must acquire to
build the product sell the product and
improve the product business growth is a
vessel for personal growth the other
route you can take is by creating a
product or service that you would buy
use and benefit from a business
principle that most people glance over
is to sell what's already selling you
don't try to create new markets just yet
you stick your hands in the ones that
are already flowing what products have
you bought recently which ones did you
use daily what courses have you taken
and gotten your own results from when I
started out on social media I created
and sold a web design and freelancing
product why did I do this because one I
was a freelance web designer and I saw
some success with it because I got the
results from those courses and I
purchased 5 to 10 courses on freelancing
that's like who I was I was a freelancer
that's all of the knowledge I had in my
head and the thing that makes that
knowledge unique is that when I create
my own it's not like I'm just copy and
pasting from others I have that entire
experience to pull from I have a way to
make it better than the others that's
the entire goal
is to soak in all of this knowledge get
results in your own way by doing it
pushing through the trial and error that
you have to and then creating a better
product that advances that industry and
the other thing is that I knew that
those products sold I bought 5 to 10 of
them buyers buy again buyers buy again
buyers buy again you're a buyer what
have you bought sell it because someone
else will buy it don't fall for the
silly belief that the market is
saturated and so As I Grew I created the
Power planner why because I used
planners all the time and I saw their
benefit in my productivity so I created
my own with the things within those
planners that actually worked for me and
I also just enjoy talking about
productivity in my content so this is a
major problem is like people are like oh
I want to talk about my interest here
but it doesn't relate to the main thing
that I want to sell and it's like do you
ever plan on evolving or becoming more
profitable or more free or having more
leverage then okay every quarter launch
something new under an interest that you
actually want to build Authority in and
talk about and when that happens you're
going to have to educate your audience
all of your content or a lot of your
content is going to have to shift to
that from a beginner lens so that anyone
can understand it and get on board with
you and so teach how to create a minimum
viable offer which is a product or
service in the video the best online
business to make a million in 2023 I'm
going to be redoing this video for 2024
step four in the build teach earn method
is to earn more by leveraging your
results at an audience we're all over
the place now at this point you have a
high value skill stack the ability to
solve profitable problems a growing
audience or readership people that have
profitable problems and experience with
building and selling you're better at
solving profitable problems you are in
one of the most optimal positions you
can be in this digital Renaissance or
new golden age that is the creator
economy you have the resources to be an
independent thinker and earner you don't
have to conform to government agendas
you hate you don't have to report to
someone for work that was assigned to
you from this place of Newfound
experience you want to productize your
results if you've helped people with
freelancing or Consulting write down the
exact steps that led you to getting
results if you don't have steps create
them now and refine as you go these
steps are your unique mechanism this is
your way of marketing a solution to
solve a problem in someone's life to
reach the desired outcome they want
write down the desired outcome of their
life what is their vision for their
future you are selling a better life
write down the worst outcome of their
life what is their anti- vision for the
future you're helping them avoid pain
that is your marketing strategy on your
landing page start by writing out their
anti Vision in detail then talk about
the vision they could achieve last
present Your solution or system or steps
or unique mechanism as a way to fill
that Gap that's it that's how you write
a landing page that's how you write a
newsletter that's how you create a
YouTube video antiv Vision Vision
solution now at this point you're also
emulating other landing pages to
understand headlines content structure
and use it as training wheels for your
first and as you grow your readership it
doesn't make sense to focus on low
leverage activities like client work and
if you don't plan to hire a team just
yet and dive into management The Logical
option is to create a digital product
that requires minimal effort with high
profit margins this is how solopreneurs
