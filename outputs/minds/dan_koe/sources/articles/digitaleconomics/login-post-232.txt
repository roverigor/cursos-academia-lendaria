The 3 Point Content Ecosystem
As the creator economy continues to grow — those that can ruthlessly dissect their Domain Of Mastery and be prolific with their words will rise to the top.
There has been a shift over the past few years.
Lambos, mansions, and other lifestyle flexes have started to fade away.
Articulation, mastery, and trust have started to fade in. People can see through the facades and search for a sense of authenticity before forming that deeper connection (like purchasing from you).
No longer can you rely on only short-form content if you want to make an impact on this world — you have to attack from all angles.
Long-form, medium-form, and short-form.
Long-form prioritizes depth and authority:
Newsletters
Articles
Podcasts
YouTube videos
A book (when and if you want to)
All long-form content should have a call to action to purchase a product from you (with other newsletter issues and products linked throughout the newsletter).
Medium-form is a mixture of depth and rapid growth:
Threads
Carousels
Instagram captions
Full-length LinkedIn posts
Clipped videos
All medium-form content should have a call to action at the bottom. Either a link to your newsletter or lead magnet as a comment — or directions telling them where to find that newsletter or lead magnet (because you can’t post links in places like an Instagram caption).
Short-form allows you to test ideas and build an audience:
Tweets
IG posts & stories
Reels & TikToks
Shorter LinkedIn posts
If a tweet performs well, you can plug your newsletter or lead magnet as a reply to that tweet (I would only promote once a day for short-form content).
All serve their unique purpose but also interconnect.
My job over this module is to give you a simple system to start implementing and leverage for rapid growth. In the next module, we will start developing your unique voice. In the last module, we will discuss branching out to new platforms once your ideas are validated and your content quality is high.
During this module, we will understand the nuances, psychology, and structure for each of these content styles — then begin streamlining our content creation so it doesn’t take all of your time to hit all of these areas.
By putting an emphasis on long-form content and trust-building — this gives us room to talk about whatever we want.
Medium and short-form content will be made for the purpose of growth and attracting a broad spectrum of people that have similar interests as you.
This will allow us to build an audience quick, encourage them to dive into your long-form content, and then that is where you can sell your products or services without seeming like a timeline spammer or “overly salesy.”
This simple 3-point content ecosystem will give you a great foundation while you focus on growing on one platform — in this case, Twitter (but can be applied to all platforms).
Point 1) High-Quality Newsletter
I didn’t understand the power of a newsletter until I was able to fit into my content flow. It was a low priority of mine for the longest time.
Now, it is the pillar that the rest of my content banks on. If my newsletter sucks (or goes unwritten) then all of my other content suffers.
This is both liberating and pressuring.
Liberating because you can spend an entire week munching and dissecting one topic to create an amazing newsletter.
Pressuring because the rest of your medium and possibly short-form content bank on it (I wouldn’t worry too much about this, you can skip a week or two if you need to).
What makes the newsletter so valuable?
You can link your products, services, and other backlogged newsletters that live online 24/7
— these are like mini sales pages that you can promote at anytime (and they aren’t SEEN as sales pages, so more people will be happy to click through and read the entire article).
You own the CSV files of emails that you can download and transfer at anytime. You can’t download your followers
— if you get banned, you’re screwed. Newsletters offer protection.
Most newsletters suck.
If you can bring a fresh perspective to peoples inbox every week, you will have dedicated fans that nobody else on social media can compete with.
By writing a newsletter each week, you develop your ideas 10x more than the guy that is only posting short and medium-form content
— your ideas will start to stick in peoples heads and your ideas will spill into your shorter content.
You can use the newsletter as a YouTube script, podcast script, medium-form content inspiration, and short-form content inspiration to attack all angles of an idea and solidify it into your followers heads (this is how they will remember you).
The key to all of this: the newsletters have to be backlogged somewhere. You have to be able to plug them under relevant tweets and posts.
ALL of your short and medium-form content will lead to a previous newsletter issue or lead magnet.
If the tweet or thread topic is related to a previous newsletter subject, link that newsletter.
If the tweet or thread topic is not related, link your lead magnet.
(If you are running a promotion, launching a product, or something that demands a higher priority — then you will stop plugging your newsletter for a bit for the sake of the promotion)
This is why I mainly recommend Revue or Substack for beginners.
Revue has an integration with Twitter, so you can advertise it on your profile to add some social proof and get some subscribers here and there.
If you want to checkout Substack and see if it’s a better fit, be my guest.
Both Revue and Substack backlog your newsletters for you. Then you can just grab the link and promote it.
Again, don’t stress picking the right newsletter platform. You can always download and transfer the emails to another provider later on (it would only take about 15-30 minutes to do so, no big deal).
As you build your list over time — your newsletter subscribers will build a deeper connection with you and consistently be exposed to your products and services in a non-salesy way.
If this doesn’t make sense yet, give it time, this is only an introduction to the importance of your newsletter — we have much more to cover that will make writing your newsletter seamless.
Don't expect to be able to run (newsletter) when you haven't learned how to walk (tweet).
What If I Don't Have A Product?
Don’t stress it. You can either create a basic consulting package or just focus on building your list for when the time comes. The bigger and better quality the list — the more sales you will make when its time to promote.
Point 2) Condensed Thread
When written with quality, your newsletter can be condensed into 1-2 medium form content pieces — in the case of Twitter as our foundation, threads are the medium form content.
You can take the main ideas from your newsletter, outline the thread, and fill it in with speed. By doing it this specific way, you can end up with a completely different piece of content that performs well on Twitter.
Keep in mind: this is optional. You don't have to use your newsletter for thread ideas, but it is there if you need them.
You can always use the main idea generation method we talked about in the last module.
Medium-form content like threads are important for:
Driving massive traffic to your products or newsletter
Having more potential virality and reach
Building authority quicker than only short-form content
Bringing in more followers because you are holding there attention longer (meaning you are giving them more reasons to engage and follow)
At the end of your threads, you will be plugging the relevant newsletter or your lead magnet.
Our goal is to send as much traffic as we can to our “mini salesman” as possible.
This leads to an email list that we own and exposure to our deeper ideas (that include nuance that short or medium-form content allow for).
So far, we are growing an audience on Twitter through well written tweets and threads — while plugging a relevant newsletter or lead magnet every single day.
Over time this will build leverage that other accounts can only dream of.
Making Sense On Its Own
There are subtle nuances we will dive into, but when you write a thread — try to make every tweet of the thread make sense on its own.
This will keep readers engaged, make it easy to turn the ideas into tweets, and is easily repostable as an Instagram carousel or other form of medium-form content.
Point 3) High Performing Tweets
Learning to write short-form content — like tweets — will only enhance the impact of your long and medium-form content.
It will help you hold attention, add a punch to your paragraphs, and the main bonus:
Allow you to keep short-form writing in mind when you are writing your long-form content.
When you are conscious and intentional with the purpose of your newsletter (to be both quality and have room for repurposing / condensing) you become an idea generation machine.
You can crack ideas for tweets AS you are writing the newsletter, structure and schedule those tweets immediately, and include them in your newsletter writing.
When these tweets publish, you can seamlessly plug your newsletter and send more traffic to it.
With all of this taken into account — you begin to attack 1 topic per week from all angles.
Like music, repetition, rhythm, and remixing is important for speaking to all aspects of the audience you are building.
Think of this as art. You are an EDM DJ for Twitter.
Every week, you can feel confident that your ideas are sticking in your audience's mind (making them remember you) and make them want to come back for more.
This Is Not A Set Structure
This is a great way to write all of your content in one, but you will also be posting standalone tweets to generate and validate more ideas. We will discuss this in the next section when we talk about a replicable system for quick growth.
Wait until the end of this module to start creating a weekly content flow.
