#  Your Digital Reality  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

Please keep in mind — we are getting into the advanced stuff here.

If you are at a beginner stage in your content creation journey, I would read
through this once but not prioritize it just yet.

If you are not seeing steady growth from your tweets, threads, engagement, and
other methods — something needs to change (whether its the content itself, the
engagement level of your replies, or quantity of connections you have made to
start growing with).

This is my way of creating your Niche Of One, Personal Monopoly, or whatever
you want to call it. The notion of becoming irreplaceable and building a loyal
audience through your content, ideas, and helping people understand (or gain
clarity).

Remember how I showed you this graphic in one of the first modules?

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/29058343_1656422314y14Creativity.png)

This brings up my notion of Digital Consciousness.

Every piece of information you become directly conscious of can be used to
create something in the digital world.

As you are dissecting certain tweets, quotes, ideas, and other pieces of
information with your _experiments_ , you are expanding your consciousness in
those specific domains. By having them written down, you can use them as
building blocks to create something of value.

I don’t want to confuse you too much with my weird theories, but I know some
of you will gain something from viewing it under this lens.

Let’s dig into the practical stuff.

 **Theorizing A Concept, Framework, Or Metaphor**

What _actually_ makes you stand out from everyone else?

What makes you _memorable_?

What makes people spread your ideas via word of mouth rather than just the
retweet button?

The ability to create a memorable way of understanding a specific idea.

That is, the ability to simplify complex topics.

The ability to make the idea “click” for somebody else.

Most of the time, you aren’t going to have revolutionary ideas. Those come
after you have had bad, good, and great ideas.

This isn’t a bad thing, it just means that you can bring a new perspective to
the idea you are trying to put across.

  * Alan Watts has the concept of “Gamble on yourself.”
  * Daniel Vasallo has the concept of “Portfolio of small bets.”
  * I’m sure a Bhuddist has some form of “Plant and water seeds daily.”
  * James Clear has the concept of “1% better every day.”
  * Jack Butcher has the concept of “Personal Monopoly”
  * I don’t know who exactly coined the term “One-Person Business” but it makes sense.

I saw this tweet from Jacob Martin and immediately DMd him to start talking
about the “Personal Portfolio” idea that he coined. There is a LOT he can go
off of from this.

> The greatest investment you can make is continually investing in yourself  
>  
> Invest in your personal portfolio. Double down on your skills and learn new
> ones  
>  
> Do this and your life gains will compound rapidly

Greg Doucette created his entire brand around “Harder Than Last Time”

Whenever you hear “1% better every day,” you think of James Clear, right?

You are bringing him followers and book sales just because he is living in
your head rent-free.

What is the commonality behind all of these?

  *  **They have depth** — it would take a few articles, podcasts, a course, or an entire book to explain the problems, benefits, experiences, topics, and other various things that explain that concept.
  *  **They make sense** — you can infer what these concepts, metaphors, or frameworks mean.
  *  **They are validated ideas** — these are best created from the topics that you love talking about and consistently get good engagement.
  *  **They are based off of experience** — everyone is saying the same thing under their own lens of perception.

“Portfolio of small bets” is from an investor background and attracts those
that resonate with that message.

“Plant and water seeds daily” would attract the more spiritually inclined
people.

“1% better every day” attracts the self-help crowd.

You can help people understand something without them having to know all of
the depth behind it.

That is what we are aiming for here. Understanding by creating new knowledge.
Knowledge that explains something in a simple way in a way that you understand
it best (so that your audience — that is congruent with your voice — will
understand it best.

How do you come up with these?

It takes practice and dissecting ideas from what we’ve previously discussed,
but the way I’ve found this to work best is to _visualize_ the idea.

This is why I started creating graphics for most of my newsletters.

  * I take a big idea from the newsletter I wrote
  * I brainstorm how I could visualize it
  * I draw it out on paper and iterate a few times
  * I slap a compelling name on it to help people remember it

There are a few concepts that I’ve creative over time (and for my book).
**These help me illustrate what’s already been said in a new and unique way.**

> The process of raising dopamine in the brain by telling people your goals,

“Mental Masturbation” came from reading about peak performance, cheap
dopamine, and how telling people your goals can release dopamine similar to
actually achieving the goal.

> Fill your brain in the afternoons with books, learning, and socialization  
>  
> Empty your brain before bed with journaling, planning, and meditation  
>  
> Use your brain in the morning with creation, output, and focus

“Fill Empty Use” came from reflecting on my daily routine. This could easily
be turned into a productivity product with the amount of depth it holds. It
combines teachings from eastern wisdom, modern deep work, and self-help
advice.

In my book, I use “The Game” to explain reality.

I use “The Virus” to explain the ego in relation to The Game.

I use “The Blur” to explain perspective, perception, and the dangers of
assumption.

I’ve talked about “going on a walk” enough to the point where other people are
talking about it all the time.

Most creators would get mad but that’s just the name of the game. Are you
going to become a better creator? Or get stuck in that stage like everyone
else?

I’m just going to create a concept around it and stay above them. They can’t
copy that without getting called out.

There are a few more that are used in this course:

  * Digital Consciousness
  * The Experience Model
  * The Epistemic Method (a process)
  * Intelligent Imitation (a process)
  * A few others that you may or may not remember

A lot of these will have crossovers with the processes you create. Think of
the concepts, frameworks, and metaphors as the depth behind your processes and
ideas that consistently pop up.

Your job is not to be a content creator.

It is to have fun being a concept creator.

Or if we want to create a concept right now — you are a Dopamine Dealer —
because that’s what good content does. It leads to good dopamine.​​​​​​​  

 **Your Digital Reality**

Everything is starting to tie together here.

But first, what creates reality? Perception.

What creates perception? Your vision, goals, values, and everything else that
forms your worldview. You understand the world in a unique way. Certain
interests, tones, and concepts make sense to you over others based on your
experience.

Our entire goal with our brand is to create a world and let people that align
with your world’s vision, goals, and values inhabit it.

Your products and content are the “school system” of your world.

You educate them and help them understand your teachings through your ideas,
concepts, and other forms of content.

Let’s take Greg O’Gallagher as a perfect example to illustrate this concept of
your “Digital Reality.”

Greg’s personal brand name is Kinobody.

He took the world by storm a few years back and is arguably the most memorable
and unique person in the fitness industry. Most of his advice goes against the
grain.

  * He trains 2-3 days a week.
  * He does low-volume, high-intensity training.
  * He doesn’t eat until much later in the day.
  * He doesn’t care about being massive, he wants to look good.

In short, he studied people like Martin Berkhan, started testing his own
methods of training / eating, coined a name for his concepts / theories, and
is now known for it.

He started eating and training in relation to his goals (not the goals of
others in the industry).

He is selling the “lifestyle” behind these concepts. The “why.” The vision,
values, and goals he is working towards. A greek god-like physique with big
shoulders, enough room in your diet to have red-wine and rice crispy treats,
and fun gym sessions.

He has also gone on to create new training styles by combining his own “Kino
Rep Training” and a little-known method called “Reverse Pyramid Training.”

While every other fitness creator doesn’t even believe they can create their
own training style, Greg is separating himself from the heard by doing just
that.

  * Why does he only train 2-3 days a week? Because he found that to be optimal for recovery and he values living life more than living in the gym.
  * Why does he do low-volume, high-intensity training? Because he places an emphasis on getting stronger in order to build muscle.
  * Why doesn’t he care about being massive? Because he realized the fitness industry is a tad corrupt and prefers the lean and athletic look over the huge bodybuilder look.

Can you see how he is creating his own way of doing things based off of his
prior experience and pulling from multiple sources to make them his own?

Some see this as good marketing, I see this as The Experience Model.

Why does all of this matter? Because Greg is “indoctrinating” people into his
lifestyle by marketing a compelling argument for it.

I have personally been intermittent fasting, doing his training style, and
drink black coffee in the mornings because of him. It is a huge part of my
life. I am a happy inhabitant of his Digital Reality and I market his products
whenever somebody asks me what I do for my health.

I would highly recommend watching Greg. He comes off a tad cocky at times but
his marketing is on point.

Your Reality = Your Worldview

Your perceived reality is just that, perceived.

It is your worldview.

It has been formed from all of your prior experiences, values, beliefs,
biases, etc.

What worldview are you inviting people to adopt with your brand, content, and
products?

**How To Outline Your Reality**

This entire phenomenon of creating your own concepts and the meaning behind
them (through experimentation, reflection, and experience) started to click
for me when I outlined my first book.

How did I do that?

  * I re-read the books that changed my life
  * I noted the ideas that stuck in my head and formed my thinking
  * I started piecing together those ideas into a book

From those ideas, I sat with them for a bit and eventually came up with my own
way of viewing them.

This entire outline has a lot of potential.

  * You can start writing the book and fleshing out the concepts with your newsletter.
  * You can start testing the names and validity of your ideas with tweets.
  * You can use your OWN concepts as your interests in the Domain Of Mastery (talk about “creating” your own niche)

This is better shown in video format to tie all of this together.
