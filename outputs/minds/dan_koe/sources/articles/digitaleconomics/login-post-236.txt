How To Leverage Twitter Threads
I want to make this clear:
Threads should be the first thing to go if you are feeling overwhelmed. Focus on quality newsletters and tweets above all.
Do not try to force them into your content ecosystem if
It is better to have few, well-written, and strategically placed threads for:
Building authority
Launching a lead magnet, product, or service
Bringing in more leads and sales for your products and services
They are also incredible for growth when you are just starting out — but only if you can get eyes on them. If you don’t have anyone to boost your threads (from networking with others or paying for shares) then I would focus on well-written tweets, replies, and developing your thoughts in your newsletter.
From what I can remember, I did not write threads for the first 3-6 months of my Twitter journey. No matter how necessary people may make them seem, they are not.
They are a bonus, not a necessity.
The thing is, you WILL need some deeper content to build authority, trust, and eventually make an income. If it’s a battle between threads or newsletters for you,
and you can’t nearly force the threads to go viral with retweets
, I would drop the threads from your weekly content flow —
but write them when it’s time to establish authority in a specific area
.
Threads are just expanded tweets. (Or other validated ideas you have).
If a tweet did well for you, you can almost guarantee it will do even better as a thread.
“Focused work” tweets always did well for me:
So I turned it into a thread:
The best way to learn thread writing is the same you would anything else.
Understand the principles (this course), choose a thread to emulate, come up with an idea, outline it, write it, post it, get better next time.
How To Pick A Thread Topic
There are a few types of threads that do very well:
A numbered list with short or long insights about each point.
A story of yourself or a client that accomplished something your audience wants to accomplish. (Transformation)
Search for multiple variations of an idea you have on Google and make your own spinoff of a blog or YouTube video headline.
Calling out a problem your target audience and teaching them how to solve it.
This part should be easy. Type parts of your into Google, YouTube, Medium, or just go off the top of your head. You can use the “
Getting Started With Content On The Right Foot
” section of the first module to generate killer ideas and outlines for threads.
Take note of the headline and key talking points.
Principles Of Thread Writing
Threads are about 3 things:
Giving your unique perspective on a particular topic
Building your expertise and authority in the Twitter space (usually beginner level)
Growing fast and having more potential virality
One great thread can change everything:
It can bring new opportunities to your DMs
It can pull in 500-5,000+ followers if it gets traction
You can include a strong call to action for your products, services, or lead magnet (and get much more out of it then tweets alone)
Threads lead to more followers because you are holding attention longer.
You are building trust and giving people more of a reason to follow you.
There are 3 aspects of a thread — it is very similar to writing a newsletter.
1) The Hook
Remember the “Attention” aspect of the last section on the APAG framework?
There are 3 things I want to remind you of:
Relevance
— how relevant is it to their everyday life? Resolved pains or potential benefits. What’s in it for the reader?
Awareness
— is it simple or complex enough for the level of awareness you are targeting? Will they understand what you are about to show them?
Effort
— how fast will they receive the result (education, entertainment, or inspiration) and is it easy to get?
Keep these in mind when we dissect certain threads.
This is where you weave in the big problem, benefit, idea, timeframe, and possibly hint at a negative personal experience.
You are also keeping in mind different aspects of what catches attention from the Attention & Engagement Psychology section.
Every tweet is important, but if the first one doesn’t capture their attention and spark curiosity, the rest of the thread will go unread. Not good.
2) The Body
As with any other piece of longer form content, outlining several key points will help you start writing much easier.
The thing that is different about threads than most other medium-form or long-form content is this:
Every tweet in the thread should be treated as a tweet itself.
You should be able to post EVERY tweet in the thread as a standalone tweet.
People will retweet and engage with these certain tweets in the thread which make it perform even better.
This is difficult. Don’t stress too much over it. But if there's anything that will make you a more concise writer, it’s trying to fit your point into a 280-character tweet within a thread.
Remember: throughout the thread, you can mention larger accounts that talk about that point. They may RT the thread and give it exposure.
3) The Call To Action
Threads are incredible for sending traffic, but there are a few things you can include when you are finished with the thread.
Recap everything you talked about into a bullet point list (if applicable and doable)
Ask people to either retweet the first tweet of the thread, follow you, or both
Plug your newsletter, product, or service to not let the traffic go to waste (you are allowed to plug on every single thread because it is longer and more valuable).
Optional: tag a list of people that inspired the thread or that are worth following, they may retweet your thread to give it more exposure.
Always send thread readers to a next step. Even if it’s just asking them to follow you.
Be Careful
If you are writing an incredible thread to a small audience, you have to create a strategy for getting more eyes on it.
The best way to do this is with the
Non-Needy Networking process.
Examples Of Great Threads & Why They Did Well
(This may be a good thread to study for more thread hooks ;))
Why it did well:
Negativity bias and calling out the problem in the first line
Numbers and social proof in the second line
Implying that there is an information gap to find out the 22 hooks
Why it did well:
Pattern interrupt with “THREAD” as the very first word
A list with confidence and negativity bias
Opens a curiosity loop
Why it did well:
BIG benefit callout (from a believable source, Naval)
It is highly relevant to many people and “without getting lucky” implies low effort
Why it did well:
It makes people wonder “what bad advice?”
It amplifies the problem in a unique way
It hones in on negativity
Why it did well:
Specific numbers and an implied transformation / benefit
“Without the fluff” decreases effort
Why it did well:
Specific numbers again
“Sentences” implies low effort and quick result
It has high relevance to anyone that has taken an English class and may be interested in improving their writing
Why it did well:
Absolutes, exaggeration, and numbers in the first line
More numbers implying an information gap in the 2nd line
Audience callout in the 4th line
Relevant and attention-grabbing image
Why it did well:
Numbers and implying a problem in the first line
Social proof and a transformation
“Dead-simple” = low effort
People love lists
I would highly HIGHLY recommend reading through these threads with the intention of understanding why they do well. How do they guide you down the page? This is how you start to develop a marketer's eye.
Start asking “why” when any piece of viral content crosses your eyes.
“Why did this catch so much attention?”
“Why did people click through to read the thread?”
“Why did people retweet this so much, but not another thread?”
An example of a failed thread:
Another one from Nick but the initial tweet is too messy, it loses people's interest.
It doesn't have 1 big idea, it doesn't spark any curiosity, and I don't immediately see a "What's in it for me?" reason for me to continue reading.
