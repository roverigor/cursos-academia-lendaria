The Creator Mindset
Whether you are taking this course to launch yourself into entrepreneurship, landing a better job, making high-level connections, or just to have fun...
You are a creator.
With that stems a lot of potential problems.
As a society we are so used to being told what to do, when to do it, and how to do it.
Personal responsibility, self-management, self-reflection, and the ability to execute on your ideas are all necessities in this line of business.
Personal growth = business growth = personal growth.
You are your own boss
You are your own project manager
You are your own content marketer
You are your own sales team
You are everything
Don't know what to do? It is your responsibility to create your own solution.
Embrace The Unpredictability
All of this is unpredictable.
You are going to feel lost, a lot.
Is there anything more that you can ask for?
You are blessed with the opportunity to chart unknown territory and make new discoveries.
True content creation and solopreneurship is NOT taught in schools. Nor should it be.
It is very new territory. There are no formal college courses on it. There can be no courses on it. Professors aren't content creators. The landscape is changing every single day.
All we have is what the online-explorers have packaged up and put into courses. It is all experience-based.
Yet, the only way you make life-changing discoveries is to do just that — get lost in the unknown, adopt the mindset of an explorer, and forge your own path to success.
The best thing you can do during these times is:
Brain dump journal about what you are struggling with.
Turn what you wrote into content (telling yourself what to do).
Allow that process to help you discover the problem.
Do not keep things in your head. Writing is what fills the gaps in your thoughts.
By documenting your life, thought processes, and experiences online — not only do you learn more about yourself, but you attract others that are experiencing something similar in their life.
There is only so much that I can teach you.
I can't tell you the exact price you should put on your product.
I can't tell you the exact words to write that will bring in 1 million followers.
I can't tell you exactly what your "niche" is or should be.
I can't tell you every single detail that should go into your landing pages, emails, and funnels.
I can only give you guidance, principle based-systems, and a starting point that we can iterate from.
I've changed my bio — without exaggeration — at least 100 times.
I've built 10+ different products and services, each doing better than the next.
I've had content that has gotten 2 likes that has lost me followers and content that has gotten 438,968 likes bringing in 120,000+ followers.
That is only possible if you stay consistent for more than 6 months and open your mind to learning from your failures.
Get used to it. Let go of the need to be perfect. Have faith in the process.
Adopt a 10-year mindset (you are going to be doing this for close to the rest of your life, hopefully).
You will never ever feel like you know exactly what you are doing.
Just create.
For the remainder of this course, I want you to take every tactic or method you hear (outside of this course) with a grain of salt.
Stop listening to people that tell you what your content, brand, or product are "supposed" to look like.
Put trust in my methods, the principles I teach you, and use them to create your own way of doing things. That is how you truly succeed in this game.
As to methods there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.
— Ralph Waldo Emerson
Stop Thinking About Saturation And Finding Your Niche
Let's do a little thought exercise.
How many people do you follow?
Probably between 100-500 people, more or less.
How many people do those people follow?
Probably the same.
How many people do creators themselves follow?
Again,
the same.
This begins to paint the picture of the creator economy — the self-sufficient Utopia.
We ALL follow people based on our unique interests.
This alone should prove to you that saturation does not exist for personal brands.
People have similar interests, but the combination of interests? Completely different.
If you can lean into your genuine curiosities, develop your expertise in an area that makes money, and focus on producing high-quality content, products, and services — you win.
This is both the hardest and easiest part.
We have to win the battle against ourselves. Against our mind, that is.
Throughout this course, we will be leaning on psychological principles to create a brand that nobody else can compete with.
This isn't going to happen overnight. or with 1 piece of content or 1 product - it is a lifelong game of iteration.
When you find yourself narrowly focused, stressed, and anxious about your progress — zoom out.
Don't look at your content as 1 thing that gets posted and disappears.
The 1, 2, 3, and 4+ year culmination of your content is what makes you irreplaceable.
Allowing longer form content to age on YouTube and podcasts are great for SEO, but that's not the main benefit.
Once you have tested, validated ideas that you enjoy talking about — you can grow on other platforms with ease.
You already know what topics perform well.
Since I spent 1 year growing on Twitter — I now have a database of viral posts that I can spice up and post to any platform.
This is only possible through iteration of your content and ideas.
Prioritize Clarity
Clarity, centropy, and ordered consciousness are your best friend (in life and business). Overthinking, psychic entropy, and chaos are your worst enemy.
Make it a habit to pause, write out all of your thoughts, and organize them.
Make your mental processes
physical
.
The Opportunity Has Never Been Higher
I'm not saying this as some kind of marketing gimmick to make you take advantage. I have full conviction that everyone can own a "business."
In other words, I have full conviction that individuals can develop their skill set, gain more than enough followers to pull in their desired income (it's not much), and move up the creator hierarchy as far as they want to go.
There has been a short-form content boom.
TikTok has creators growing faster than ever out of nowhere.
Instagram is putting more effort into reels and trying to copy TikTok.
People can consume short-form tweets, TikToks, reels, and others
faster.
Meaning they can be exposed to more creators.
Meaning they can follow, and remember more creators.
Meaning there will be a lot of terrible content.
Meaning if you have a deeper understanding of content and offer creation, you will stand out and make 10x more than the other creators.
As an example, Instagram recently put out a "reels bonus" to incentivize new creators (because there is a demand for them).
I tested it out.
After 1 week I had 200K views on my reels.
They paid me $120.
This is what most creators will be happy with — relying on the platform to pay them.
Since I have my own content and product ecosystem — in that same week, I made $13,625 from free traffic on social media.
The new 1% of creators won't be the ones that go viral all the time.
It will be the ones that put Digital Economics into practice.
Join The 1%
There
would not
be saturation if there were 50% creators and 50% consumers (creators are STILL consumers).
But, only 1% are creators.
And if history repeats itself, that number will stay FAR below 50%.
The opportunity is that high. You only realize this once you start.
Those that value consistency will win.
Delete for good?
No, keep it
Yes, delete
