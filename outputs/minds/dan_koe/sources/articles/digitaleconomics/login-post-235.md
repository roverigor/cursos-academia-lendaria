#  The APAG Persuasive Writing Framework  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to
my favorites")

There are a lot of writing frameworks out there.

After trying them all and making connections between them — I’ve created my
own that I see as most effective.

If you want to read up on solid writing frameworks and connect the dots for
yourself, some of my favorites are:

[PASTOR](https://goinswriter.com/better-sales-copy/) — for longer-form writing
that works well for persuasive blogs and sales pages.

[AIDA](https://www.siegemedia.com/creation/aida-model) — a basic framework for
shorter form writing like tweets, email opt in pages, and sometimes a general
structure for long form content.

[PAS(O)](https://www.copywritematters.com/paso-copywriting-formula/) — great
for any type of content writing.

ALL of these follow a general storytelling structure that sparks curiosity:

  *  **A problem is introduced or implied** — making people curious about what caused that problem (the law of cause and effect). Hint at the effect and THEN dive into the cause.
  *  **It exposes people to a potential sequence of events** — this is similar, but makes people want to understand the sequence of events that lead to a particular resolution (happy ending of a story).
  *  **Creating an information gap** — implying that there is educational, entertaining, or inspiring information that the specific reader desires.

Once curiosity is sparked, you must deliver on your promises through:

  * Personal, client, or other reference experiences that state or imply a transformation. A before (the problem) and an after (the resolution and associated benefits).
  * Step-by-step advice on how to get to the resolution quicker (a unique solution).
  * A crystal clear call to action to lead them deeper into your other content or spark behavior change — again, so they can associate that good behavior with you.

You do not have to use my framework. You can use any that you’d like. But I
have considered these aspects of curiosity and storytelling when crafting my
own.

I call mine the APAG framework.

Attention, Perspective, Advantage, and Gamify.

All are backed by psychological research with the intention of kicking someone
into a flow-like experience… making them associate that good experience with
you.

What can this be used for?

  * Your newsletter
  * Podcast or YouTube scripts
  * Multiple threads or medium-form posts
  * Sales pages or opt-in pages
  * Course modules
  * Potential ideas for tweets or short-form posts

For now, we are focused on using this to write killer newsletters and practice
our writing.

If everyone followed this framework using the suggestions I give (and taking
The Experience Model into account), everyone will have unique and impactful
content.

Before we dive into this framework:

None of this is set in stone. There are infinite ways to write high-quality
newsletters.

If you don’t like or want to write long-form fusion newsletters like I do, I
would highly recommend studying different types of newsletters like:

[Justin Welsh’s Saturday Solopreneur](https://www.justinwelsh.me/blog)

[Tim Ferris Five Bullet Friday](https://go.tim.blog/5-bullet-friday-1/)

[James Clear 3-2-1 Newsletter](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1)

[Mark Manson's Mindf*ck Monthly](https://markmanson.net/)

And any other style of a newsletter that one of your “mentors” have.

One other connection you should make:

Look at their opt-in pages and how they write them. They all follow some form
of persuasive writing frameworks like mine or the ones listed above.

__

Note One Common Thing

Everyone listed above has a style of newsletter that they can stick to on a
weekly basis. It is incorporated into their routine and they have systemized
the production of the newsletter.

If creating a themed newsletter allows you to write it better, do that. You
can always iterate and change it down the road. (I’ve changed my newsletter
theme 5-10 times.)

**Attention — The Art Of Hooks And Headlines**

Your hook or headline are the most important aspect of your content.

If the hook doesn’t catch their attention — are they going to read the rest of
the content that you put a lot of effort into? Or will they scroll past
leaving your hard work gone unnoticed?

These are the 3 things that will make them continue reading:

  *  **Relevance** — how relevant is it to their everyday life? Resolved pains or potential benefits. What’s in it for the reader?
  *  **Awareness** — is it simple or complex enough for the level of awareness you are targeting? Will they understand what you are about to show them?
  *  **Effort** — how fast will they receive the result (education, entertainment, or inspiration) and is it easy to get?

This will make more sense in the next section where we discuss threads.

These do not all have to be included in your headline or hook — but they
should all be considered. The most potent ones should be used.

In a newsletter or article headline, you have much less room than a hook in a
thread or other medium-form post (like a LinkedIn post).

Now, we can start to piece together our headline or hook with pieces of our
outline and article (the problems, benefits, experiences, etc).

  *  **The BIG problem** — you can create this by summarizing all of the problems you have listed.
  *  **The BIG benefit** — again, you can create this by summarizing all of the benefits into one.
  *  **The BIG idea** — can you summarize the most impactful parts of the post into one sentence?
  *  **The transformation process** — you can use numbers or a unique name to hint at the process that will get them results (posing an information gap).
  *  **Timeframe** — can you quantify a timeframe for how long it will take them to read the content or get the result you are promising? Use numbers.
  *  **Negative personal experience** — if you include a personal experience in your content, can you imply a low point during that experience and the emotion associated with it?

Treat all of these as building blocks for the perfect hook.

You can’t include all of them, that’s the fun in this. You have to piece them
together in a way that you think will be most impactful. With time, feedback
and testing you will get better and better at writing good hooks and
headlines.

My Best Advice

Do not write your hook or headline until you have written the entire post.
Then you can pull the best aspects of it and craft an attention-grabbing hook.

**Perspective — Paint A Picture Of The Enemy Or Why A Perspective Is Wrong**

This is where you relate to and amplify the problems that the reader is
currently experiencing. This is also where you create the “enemy” of your
story.

The best way you can do this is to paint a picture of a common perspective on
the topic you are writing about.

 _Place a heavy emphasis on the problems associated with that perspective and
the pains they cause._

For more firepower, relate to them with a personal experience you’ve had with
that perspective.

This is how I start most of my articles. I give a personal experience to help
illustrate the problem and relate to the readers.

People want to feel understood. If they feel understood, they are more open to
hearing what you have to say.

 **Not sure what to say in this section?**

Good copywriting is about piecing together everything you have available to
you.

For Perspective, you can use:

  * Problems
  * Benefits
  * Examples
  * Metaphors
  * Quotes or Tweets
  * Personal or popular stories
  * Comparisons
  * Concepts

To help you paint a picture of the problem people are facing.

Stories as a whole are pieced together by more stories. Stories are a
combination of everything we have listed above in order to guide the story.

If you are having trouble painting a picture of the Perspective aspect of this
framework (the problem with that perspective) — use the list above to
brainstorm new ways to attack that problem.

Your goal is to help them understand. You don’t need to solve everything yet.

__

Focus On The Problem

All persuasive writing starts with painting a picture of the problem.

Use a personal story to illustrate it or just go straight into stating what
the problem is.

When your writing gets better with practice, you’ll be able to weave in
personal experiences, metaphors, and other things that will make your writing
more impactful.

**Advantage — Paint A Picture Of The Hero, Vision, Or Why Your Perspective Is
Right**

With persuasive writing, you are presenting a credible argument to sell
something.

YOU are always selling, or at least you should be.

Not only selling products — but selling ideas and better ways of doing things.
That’s what people want.

Now that you’ve painted a picture of their faulty perspective and the problems
associated with it — you can start to shift they perspective to view things
the way you do.

This is where you can present novel ideas, concepts, social proof, and
experiences that make your argument credible.

If you have quotes, tweets, or other references you can include — that will
only make your argument more credible.

This is the turning point in this metaphorical story. You are showing them a
better way of doing things.

Again, you can use examples, problems, benefits, stories, metaphors, quotes,
tweets, etc to help structure your argument and make it more credible.

__

Focus On Education

How can you educate people to the point of understanding your perspective?

What do they need to know in order to understand where you are now?

What are the pieces of the story they are missing that are preventing them
from understanding your better way of doing things?

**Gamify — Create A Hierarchy Of Challenging Goals**

When you think of a game, you think of a set hierarchy of goals (or quests,
missions, etc) that give people clarity on what to do.

In short, you “gamify” by giving step-by-step advice on how to achieve the
transformation you’ve described in the post. (From old problem-ridden
perspective to an advantageous perspective).

You are wrapping everything up into a clear, concise, and actionable way of
getting a specific result — and making it clear on what they should do next.

What are the steps (or advice) that will help them overcome the problem you
mentioned in “Perspective?”

What can they implement right now that will get them results?

__

Focus On Clarity

What are the exact steps someone can take to reach the desired outcome of
whatever you are talking about?

**How To Best Use This Framework**

There is no set length for each part of this framework.

You should aim to hit on each part of APAG, but you aren’t required to have a
specific length to each section.

Treat it as a soft guideline. Just be sure to hit the problem, benefits, and
solution to the problem they have.

The hook can be short or long.

The picture you paint of their perspective can be 2 sentences or half the
article.

The advantageous perspective you show them can also be 2 sentences or the
entire article.

When you outline steps to achieving a desired result, that can be 90% of the
article if you’d like.

Most Twitter threads start with a good hook, paint a picture of the problem in
1 tweet, then go straight into a list.

All of these are pieces of an argument that you should include. That is what
makes this fun.

 _ **Writing long-form content is extremely difficult at first.**_

I remember my first time writing a blog and sales page.

It took me HOURS (if not days) to write a first crappy draft.

I was staring at the screen, nothing coming to my mind, stressing out that I
would never get it written. The literal definition of writer's block.

This is okay. It is an unavoidable step.

The best thing you can do in this situation is outline and start to fill in
the blanks.

Outline key points of your content.

Write talking points within those key points.

Start to write about ideas that come to mind.

If you have to, put it down, go on a walk, and let your mind calm down.

 **If This Doesn't Make Sense Yet (It Won't)**

You will have to understand and internalize the structure of most long form
content online.

You will also have to understand storytelling. They both interconnect.

Here is the general persuasive writing structure:

  *  **Hook** — we’ve talked about this.
  *  **Lead** — introducing and agitating the problem
  *  **Body** — key points (numbered or not) separated by headlines to help learn and understand the topic
  *  **Conclusion** — a summary or step-by-step advice to overcoming the problem
  *  **CTA** — a call to action to do something next

This IS a storytelling structure.

Storytelling is NOT always a story.

Stories consist of anecdotes, research, examples, metaphors, quotes, tweets,
videos, other content, and anything else you can do to help someone else
understand.

You present a problem and guide someone to overcome it.

That’s what a story is.

Every story follows the problem > resolution structure.

In order to reach that resolution, you need to educate them on the problem
itself and guide them to overcome it.

HOW you do that is by piecing together things that you’ve been made conscious
of.

If This Is Overwhelming

If this is causing too much overwhelm, focus on tweets and threads for now.

Those can be used as firepower later.

In the next module, we will be building a database of ideas that you can treat
as building blocks for your long-form content.

Delete for good?

No, keep it

Yes, delete
