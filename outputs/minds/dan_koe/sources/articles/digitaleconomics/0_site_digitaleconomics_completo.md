#  The APAG Persuasive Writing Framework  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to
my favorites")

There are a lot of writing frameworks out there.

After trying them all and making connections between them — I’ve created my
own that I see as most effective.

If you want to read up on solid writing frameworks and connect the dots for
yourself, some of my favorites are:

[PASTOR](https://goinswriter.com/better-sales-copy/) — for longer-form writing
that works well for persuasive blogs and sales pages.

[AIDA](https://www.siegemedia.com/creation/aida-model) — a basic framework for
shorter form writing like tweets, email opt in pages, and sometimes a general
structure for long form content.

[PAS(O)](https://www.copywritematters.com/paso-copywriting-formula/) — great
for any type of content writing.

ALL of these follow a general storytelling structure that sparks curiosity:

  *  **A problem is introduced or implied** — making people curious about what caused that problem (the law of cause and effect). Hint at the effect and THEN dive into the cause.
  *  **It exposes people to a potential sequence of events** — this is similar, but makes people want to understand the sequence of events that lead to a particular resolution (happy ending of a story).
  *  **Creating an information gap** — implying that there is educational, entertaining, or inspiring information that the specific reader desires.

Once curiosity is sparked, you must deliver on your promises through:

  * Personal, client, or other reference experiences that state or imply a transformation. A before (the problem) and an after (the resolution and associated benefits).
  * Step-by-step advice on how to get to the resolution quicker (a unique solution).
  * A crystal clear call to action to lead them deeper into your other content or spark behavior change — again, so they can associate that good behavior with you.

You do not have to use my framework. You can use any that you’d like. But I
have considered these aspects of curiosity and storytelling when crafting my
own.

I call mine the APAG framework.

Attention, Perspective, Advantage, and Gamify.

All are backed by psychological research with the intention of kicking someone
into a flow-like experience… making them associate that good experience with
you.

What can this be used for?

  * Your newsletter
  * Podcast or YouTube scripts
  * Multiple threads or medium-form posts
  * Sales pages or opt-in pages
  * Course modules
  * Potential ideas for tweets or short-form posts

For now, we are focused on using this to write killer newsletters and practice
our writing.

If everyone followed this framework using the suggestions I give (and taking
The Experience Model into account), everyone will have unique and impactful
content.

Before we dive into this framework:

None of this is set in stone. There are infinite ways to write high-quality
newsletters.

If you don’t like or want to write long-form fusion newsletters like I do, I
would highly recommend studying different types of newsletters like:

[Justin Welsh’s Saturday Solopreneur](https://www.justinwelsh.me/blog)

[Tim Ferris Five Bullet Friday](https://go.tim.blog/5-bullet-friday-1/)

[James Clear 3-2-1 Newsletter](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1)

[Mark Manson's Mindf*ck Monthly](https://markmanson.net/)

And any other style of a newsletter that one of your “mentors” have.

One other connection you should make:

Look at their opt-in pages and how they write them. They all follow some form
of persuasive writing frameworks like mine or the ones listed above.

__

Note One Common Thing

Everyone listed above has a style of newsletter that they can stick to on a
weekly basis. It is incorporated into their routine and they have systemized
the production of the newsletter.

If creating a themed newsletter allows you to write it better, do that. You
can always iterate and change it down the road. (I’ve changed my newsletter
theme 5-10 times.)

**Attention — The Art Of Hooks And Headlines**

Your hook or headline are the most important aspect of your content.

If the hook doesn’t catch their attention — are they going to read the rest of
the content that you put a lot of effort into? Or will they scroll past
leaving your hard work gone unnoticed?

These are the 3 things that will make them continue reading:

  *  **Relevance** — how relevant is it to their everyday life? Resolved pains or potential benefits. What’s in it for the reader?
  *  **Awareness** — is it simple or complex enough for the level of awareness you are targeting? Will they understand what you are about to show them?
  *  **Effort** — how fast will they receive the result (education, entertainment, or inspiration) and is it easy to get?

This will make more sense in the next section where we discuss threads.

These do not all have to be included in your headline or hook — but they
should all be considered. The most potent ones should be used.

In a newsletter or article headline, you have much less room than a hook in a
thread or other medium-form post (like a LinkedIn post).

Now, we can start to piece together our headline or hook with pieces of our
outline and article (the problems, benefits, experiences, etc).

  *  **The BIG problem** — you can create this by summarizing all of the problems you have listed.
  *  **The BIG benefit** — again, you can create this by summarizing all of the benefits into one.
  *  **The BIG idea** — can you summarize the most impactful parts of the post into one sentence?
  *  **The transformation process** — you can use numbers or a unique name to hint at the process that will get them results (posing an information gap).
  *  **Timeframe** — can you quantify a timeframe for how long it will take them to read the content or get the result you are promising? Use numbers.
  *  **Negative personal experience** — if you include a personal experience in your content, can you imply a low point during that experience and the emotion associated with it?

Treat all of these as building blocks for the perfect hook.

You can’t include all of them, that’s the fun in this. You have to piece them
together in a way that you think will be most impactful. With time, feedback
and testing you will get better and better at writing good hooks and
headlines.

__

My Best Advice

Do not write your hook or headline until you have written the entire post.
Then you can pull the best aspects of it and craft an attention-grabbing hook.

**Perspective — Paint A Picture Of The Enemy Or Why A Perspective Is Wrong**

This is where you relate to and amplify the problems that the reader is
currently experiencing. This is also where you create the “enemy” of your
story.

The best way you can do this is to paint a picture of a common perspective on
the topic you are writing about.

 _Place a heavy emphasis on the problems associated with that perspective and
the pains they cause._

For more firepower, relate to them with a personal experience you’ve had with
that perspective.

This is how I start most of my articles. I give a personal experience to help
illustrate the problem and relate to the readers.

People want to feel understood. If they feel understood, they are more open to
hearing what you have to say.

 **Not sure what to say in this section?**

Good copywriting is about piecing together everything you have available to
you.

For Perspective, you can use:

  * Problems
  * Benefits
  * Examples
  * Metaphors
  * Quotes or Tweets
  * Personal or popular stories
  * Comparisons
  * Concepts

To help you paint a picture of the problem people are facing.

Stories as a whole are pieced together by more stories. Stories are a
combination of everything we have listed above in order to guide the story.

If you are having trouble painting a picture of the Perspective aspect of this
framework (the problem with that perspective) — use the list above to
brainstorm new ways to attack that problem.

Your goal is to help them understand. You don’t need to solve everything yet.

__

Focus On The Problem

All persuasive writing starts with painting a picture of the problem.

Use a personal story to illustrate it or just go straight into stating what
the problem is.

When your writing gets better with practice, you’ll be able to weave in
personal experiences, metaphors, and other things that will make your writing
more impactful.

**Advantage — Paint A Picture Of The Hero, Vision, Or Why Your Perspective Is
Right**

With persuasive writing, you are presenting a credible argument to sell
something.

YOU are always selling, or at least you should be.

Not only selling products — but selling ideas and better ways of doing things.
That’s what people want.

Now that you’ve painted a picture of their faulty perspective and the problems
associated with it — you can start to shift they perspective to view things
the way you do.

This is where you can present novel ideas, concepts, social proof, and
experiences that make your argument credible.

If you have quotes, tweets, or other references you can include — that will
only make your argument more credible.

This is the turning point in this metaphorical story. You are showing them a
better way of doing things.

Again, you can use examples, problems, benefits, stories, metaphors, quotes,
tweets, etc to help structure your argument and make it more credible.

__

Focus On Education

How can you educate people to the point of understanding your perspective?

What do they need to know in order to understand where you are now?

What are the pieces of the story they are missing that are preventing them
from understanding your better way of doing things?

**Gamify — Create A Hierarchy Of Challenging Goals**

When you think of a game, you think of a set hierarchy of goals (or quests,
missions, etc) that give people clarity on what to do.

In short, you “gamify” by giving step-by-step advice on how to achieve the
transformation you’ve described in the post. (From old problem-ridden
perspective to an advantageous perspective).

You are wrapping everything up into a clear, concise, and actionable way of
getting a specific result — and making it clear on what they should do next.

What are the steps (or advice) that will help them overcome the problem you
mentioned in “Perspective?”

What can they implement right now that will get them results?

__

Focus On Clarity

What are the exact steps someone can take to reach the desired outcome of
whatever you are talking about?

**How To Best Use This Framework**

There is no set length for each part of this framework.

You should aim to hit on each part of APAG, but you aren’t required to have a
specific length to each section.

Treat it as a soft guideline. Just be sure to hit the problem, benefits, and
solution to the problem they have.

The hook can be short or long.

The picture you paint of their perspective can be 2 sentences or half the
article.

The advantageous perspective you show them can also be 2 sentences or the
entire article.

When you outline steps to achieving a desired result, that can be 90% of the
article if you’d like.

Most Twitter threads start with a good hook, paint a picture of the problem in
1 tweet, then go straight into a list.

All of these are pieces of an argument that you should include. That is what
makes this fun.

 _ **Writing long-form content is extremely difficult at first.**_

I remember my first time writing a blog and sales page.

It took me HOURS (if not days) to write a first crappy draft.

I was staring at the screen, nothing coming to my mind, stressing out that I
would never get it written. The literal definition of writer's block.

This is okay. It is an unavoidable step.

The best thing you can do in this situation is outline and start to fill in
the blanks.

Outline key points of your content.

Write talking points within those key points.

Start to write about ideas that come to mind.

If you have to, put it down, go on a walk, and let your mind calm down.

 **If This Doesn't Make Sense Yet (It Won't)**

You will have to understand and internalize the structure of most long form
content online.

You will also have to understand storytelling. They both interconnect.

Here is the general persuasive writing structure:

  *  **Hook** — we’ve talked about this.
  *  **Lead** — introducing and agitating the problem
  *  **Body** — key points (numbered or not) separated by headlines to help learn and understand the topic
  *  **Conclusion** — a summary or step-by-step advice to overcoming the problem
  *  **CTA** — a call to action to do something next

This IS a storytelling structure.

Storytelling is NOT always a story.

Stories consist of anecdotes, research, examples, metaphors, quotes, tweets,
videos, other content, and anything else you can do to help someone else
understand.

You present a problem and guide someone to overcome it.

That’s what a story is.

Every story follows the problem > resolution structure.

In order to reach that resolution, you need to educate them on the problem
itself and guide them to overcome it.

HOW you do that is by piecing together things that you’ve been made conscious
of.

__

If This Is Overwhelming

If this is causing too much overwhelm, focus on tweets and threads for now.

Those can be used as firepower later.

In the next module, we will be building a database of ideas that you can treat
as building blocks for your long-form content.

Delete for good?

No, keep it

Yes, delete

#  The Eternal & Evergreen Markets  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my
favorites")

I'm going to save you A LOT of pain.

But you will have to go through some pain at first (regarding your ego).

 _Nobody cares about your skills, interests, what you can build, or what you
can help with._

 **People are selfish.**

They only care about what those skills, interests, and help _can do for them._

Specifically, what it can do to **impact their direct human experience and
quality of life.**

To do this correctly, you need to understand where all burning, biological,
and evergreen problems exist.

 **The Eternal Markets**

Health. Wealth. Relationships.

Those are the eternal markets.

Under one umbrella, the main eternal market is Happiness — in more sustainable
terms: improving someone's quality of life.

Drill them into your brain.

Stop thinking about your skills and interests.

Start thinking about how your skills and interests help solve problems in the
eternal markets.

How can your skill or interest help someone:

  * Make more money
  * Free up more time
  * Increase their life enjoyment
  * End unconscious pains
  * Boost their self-esteem

What is the real-world _utility_ ​​​​​​​behind your ideas.

Do you see where I am going with this?

Leaders are those that help others self-actualize.

As Ralph Waldo Emerson said in the previous section — “As to methods there may
be a million and then some, but principles are few."

Solving problems relating to basic human needs and helping them self-actualize
is the **principle** in this case.

Your **method** for solving a problem within one or multiple of those
verticals is how you win.

I have seen too many creators and solopreneurs fail because they cannot
practice and internalize this.

People don't care about the method. If someone wants to make more money within
the wealth vertical, they can:

  * Freelance
  * Affiliate marketing
  * Consulting
  * Take online surveys
  * Software development to get a job
  * Driving for Uber or Lyft

I could go on and on. When someone wants to increase their income, they will
use your method IF you can provide a compelling argument for it.

We will go deeper into this when we talk about influence and persuasion.

I would encourage you to think about the millions of methods that can be used
to solve problems within each of the health, wealth, and relationships
verticals.

Your sole purpose with all of this is to present a persuasive argument as to
why your method is best for that person.

__

Focus On Improvement

Improvement stems from awareness. People cannot improve what they are not
aware of.

Your job is to spread seeds of awareness and funnel people into tools that
will help them improve that area of their life.

**Maslow's Hierarchy Of Needs**

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28453742_1654006205fUhMaslows1.png)

We will be diving into this much more later — Digital Economics is filled with
systems based around these principles.

Your content should be positioned in a way that targets a specific **pain** or
**benefit** that lies within Maslow's Hierarchy Of Needs.

Pains and benefits. Pains and benefits. **PAINS. AND. F**KING. BENEFITS.**

Act like I'm yelling at you because I am.

Do not write a single piece of content, create a product, or pitch a service
without having these in mind.

This does not only apply to content.

This applies to every single touchpoint of your brand.

  * Your social media profile
  * Your free lead magnet
  * Your email opt-in copywriting
  * Your emails themselves
  * Your landing pages and sales pages
  * Your entire website
  * The teachings in your products
  * Your content, replies, and anything you post online

This is the foundation of persuasion and sparking behavior change.

Behavior change is how you get other's to improve their lives. In turn, they
will attribute their success to you. Win-win.

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28453758_1654006234r7cmaslows2.png)

 **Keep in mind:**

You have to experience these things before you can teach them to someone that
is one step behind you.

If you want to make it in business (and the world) you have to pursue
continuous personal development — especially in the areas of your interests
and expertise.

Treat this as a seed and allow it to be planted in your head.

You will be creating a structured research, learning, and application habit in
future modules.

__

Be Mindful

Consider the content or products you have already created (or other's content
or products that readers have been exposed to).

What stage are they at? What are they aware of? How can you position your
message to impact that specific person in their journey?

**The Beginner Market & Mindset**

One of the biggest mistakes I see creators, solopreneurs, and other online
business owners make (again, pertaining to ego):

( **Side note:** notice how I am introducing this topic with a pain — because
it makes you interested and keeps you reading.)

 _They refuse to adopt a beginner's mindset._

They subconsciously see themselves as "too smart" for posting beginner-level
content.

 **Newsflash: 90+% of the market are beginners.**

ESPECIALLY those that are on short form, top-of-funnel platforms like:

  * Twitter
  * TikTok
  * Facebook
  * Instagram
  * LinkedIn (in some regards)

These are the easiest platforms to grow on for this reason.

If you can teach former you (that was a beginner) how to get to where you are
now in a streamlined way, you win.

That is more difficult than it sounds (hence this course), but that is the key
to success in a nutshell.

This is why beginner products sell the best.

Just look at a course website like **Udemy or Skillshare.**

( **Seriously, go look at beginner products in an area you think you could
teach.** Buy one of the courses for cheap. If you used that product as
inspiration to create one for your own brand, you could charge more and sell
it to the loyal audience you build. **Remember** : saturation doesn't exist
when you are selling from a unique perspective to your Niche Of One audience.
People buy from you because it's you, not a huge centralized platform that
they aren't even aware of.)

This is why beginner content goes viral.

Just look at Twitter platitudes.

The problem with all of this is "standing out" from the crowd — which is where
an impeccable personal brand, novel perspectives, and an education-based
content ecosystem comes into play.

When those come together as you go through the course, you will win in the sea
of creators that have no idea what they are doing in regards to marketing (in
other words, they are beginners, you instantly surpass 90+% of your
competitors.)

Here is a general, foolproof process for making a solid income:

  * Post beginner and intermediate level content from your unique perspective (based on research and experience)
  * Educate people and **go more in-depth** with longer-form emails, articles, and a lead magnet to raise them up Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (THIS is where you can show how smart you are and build a deeper connection without having to worry about the algorithm).
  * Sell a beginner level product to filter out buyers from free-loaders
  * Again, you are educating them to the point of being a fit for your other products or services (creating your own customers in a sense).
  * Upsell another product, membership, or freelance / consulting service to those that purchased your product.

It is not optimal to build everything out in that order — we will be doing it
in reverse in the full Digital Economics course.

When in doubt — go beginner level.

You Probably Have Enough Experience

Don't sell yourself short. If you are taking this course, I'm sure you've
improved certain areas of your life.

Reflect on those times — did you know _anything_ similar to what you know now?

Would your seemingly "basic" advice help your former self? Yes? Then it will
help others. Zoom out.

#  The Principles Of Social Growth  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my
favorites")

As with many things in life... _if you aren't growing, you're dying._

(Take that with a grain of salt if you are just starting out. Growth is small
and inconsistent until you post that one piece of content that changes
everything, mentally, for you).

I want to reiterate where your priorities should be.

If you haven’t grown a substantial amount on one platform, trying to grow on
another platform will be just as difficult.

 _ **Until you are ready to branch out – I would go through this module for
the sole purpose of making connections. Try to understand the overall system
and mechanics of social media as a whole. There are a lot of crossovers that
may open your eyes and help you grow faster on Twitter.**_

There is a reason I am able to grow so rapidly on other social platforms:

  * I spent 1 year building my Twitter account and wrote 10K+ tweets
  * I had a database of tweets that I know get engagement and bring in followers
  * I practiced capturing, holding, and converting attention until it was second nature (this is 10x easier to practice with short-form writing than something like video, graphics, or other visuals).
  * I can repost all of my old tweets endlessly and outperform most accounts because they didn’t practice crafting an impactful message (capturing attention and delivering value)
  * My follower count acts as leverage. I can reach out to big Instagram accounts and offer to trade shares. They share me on Insta (or any other platform), I share them on Twitter. Social Leverage.
  * I built and grew with a network of other creators. We have masterminded and taken over other platforms in a strategic fashion.

It all starts with everything we discussed in modules 1 and 2 of this course.

 **Focus On Leverage, Not Money**

Remember the 3 Pillars Of Social Leverage?

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/29199904_1657031698YJZSocial_Leverage.png)

This is the result of good, diverse, and impactful content.

I want you to understand the importance of this through a story.

I first met Justin Welsh (the LinkedIn king) by connecting with him in the DMs
(using the Non-Needy Networking framework).

I “led with value” by offering to have him on my podcast. I didn’t have to get
him on a podcast, I could have just gotten on a call with him and it still
would have worked out the same way.

Over the past few months he’s been helping me with LinkedIn and I’ve been
helping him with Twitter and Instagram.

On Twitter, I mostly just comment on his posts. On Instagram, I sent him Loom
videos on the basics of the platform and my current system for content
repurposing (what you are learning in this course).

I grow fast on LinkedIn through his help, he grows more on Twitter and
Instagram.

Win-win.

This week I asked him why he is working with me (and a few others) to do this
with.

His response:

 _“You’re a good creator. You write good content, don’t get caught up in
drama, care about your work, and deliver value on a consistent basis. I like
working with people I can trust.”_

Those aren’t his exact words, but they are pretty close.

In short, focusing on the money is only going to hurt potential opportunities.

Focus on writing great tweets, writing threads / newsletters, and networking
for the sake of growth while giving away as much value as you can.

If you want to help other creators with things you’ve learned in this course,
feel free. Just be sure to _make it your own_ through The Epistemic Method,
experience, and writing about it first.

 **Another story about the first time I spent $3500 on coaching:**

Perception is powerful.

When I was around 5,000 followers, an account that I loved sent me a DM.

“Hey Dan, I want to talk to you, when can we get on a call?”

No joke. That’s it.

He had around 40K followers at the time.

I loved his content to the point that him sending me a DM sent me into fight
or flight.

 _“No way, this guy wants to talk to me? That’s insane. I HAVE to get on this
call.”_ That was my thought process.

I was scared sh*tless because he was an authority in the space, but I knew it
would open up opportunities for me.

We scheduled a call, talked for a bit, and he asked if I wanted to hear about
his coaching.

I wasn’t even paying attention. I said yes, he explained the coaching and then
told me the price.

Again… I wasn’t even paying attention. I was awestruck that I was on a call
with a guy that I had looked up to for so long.

I said yes without hesitation, paid the invoice, and that was that.

By the way, this was social media coaching (which anyone can sell if they
build an audience successfully).

He rarely talks about social media (because it doesn’t get too much
engagement), he talks about self-improvement. But I knew he had social media,
writing, design, business, and mindset expertise just because of the brand
he’s built using those skills.

THIS is the power of consistently putting out content.

NO freelancer or coach without an audience can even fathom this reality.

You eliminate a lot of the traditional sales process by just consistently
putting out good content for a year.

 **One more short story to hammer this point home:**

I reached out to a HUGE account on Twitter to ask for help growing my account.

He said, _“I offer a 30-minute call and 10 retweets for $5000.”_ (Because he
built LEVERAGE, that’s why he can charge whatever he wants.)

A lot of money, but I accepted and maxed out my credit card.

The retweets didn’t even do that well. Our audiences didn’t have much
crossover.

But it didn’t matter, I was in his circle now.

I could reach out to him for almost anything and get a response. Even better
if I offered something in return like my Instagram strategy.

His retweets:

  * Put me in front of his entire 300,000+ audience
  * Put me in front of HUGE accounts that follow him
  * Got me on good terms with himself, he followed me (people can see that he followed me when they visit my profile, that helps with authority… a part of social leverage)

It doesn’t matter if they didn’t follow me immediately.

I was put on their radar.

I was made AWARE to them. Like the sales process, people don’t buy right after
seeing your product. People may not follow you the first time they see your
tweet.

Those retweets acted as him endorsing my content. Also, he wouldn’t have
worked with me or retweeted me if my content wasn’t good.

Long game (emphasis on the word “game”). There is MUCH more than you can see.

Those retweets were expensive, but I made that “money” back in much more than
just money.

I am not saying that you need to shovel money into social media (although it’s
not a bad idea if this is truly the vessel for your life’s work).

I’m saying that leverage trumps all.

Leverage comes from well-written content, building an audience, and networking
with people (both free and paid).

There Is More Than What You See

Pay attention to more than just your profile, content, and engagement. This is
SOCIAL media. It requires PEOPLE.

How do your interactions with people (that the timeline doesn't see) impact
your growth?

Start becoming aware of this.

**What To Focus On**

In the following sections of this module, we will be going over the
fundamentals, strategies, and nuances to every platform that can work off of
our content ecosystem.

Here is what you will be focusing on:

 **1) Leveraging Others’ Audiences For Growth**

When you are just starting out, the ONLY way you are going to grow on ANY
social media platform is by leveraging others audiences.

You do this by:

  * Joining communities and cohorts
  * DMing people you want to grow, network, or work with
  * Commenting under big accounts with “value add” replies
  * Practicing your tweet writing by quote tweeting accounts and using their tweet as inspiration
  * Optional — but should always be mentioned and made less taboo for those that choose to play the social media game — is paying for shares on good content

Growth is a priority.

If you aren’t growing, something needs to change.

  * Ask your network what they think you could be doing better
  * Broaden the topics you talk about so they are relevant to more people (example: instead of talking about “online business” talk about “money” as a whole)
  * Be sure your bio and profile is broad enough to attract a large audience — your emails, lead magnets, and other backend content are how you get them “up to speed” on the specific things you talk about.
  * Practice and put conscious effort into your writing. If it takes 2 hours to write an attention-grabbing tweet and deliver structured value, that’s okay. You will get better.
  * Use the methods we discussed in modules 1 and 2 — go back through them and see if you learn something new that you may have missed earlier.

 **2) Understanding The General Level Of Sophistication Of The Platform**

Pay attention to what kind of posts get the most engagement on each platform.

You can gauge this by looking at the comment sections of someone's post.

On TikTok or Instagram you will have a low level of sophistication people that
will always try to fight you in the comments if your content is good (ignore
and block them).

On Twitter and LinkedIn people have a higher level of awareness and are open
to learning new things. LinkedIn of course has a lot of professionals that
scroll LinkedIn while they work. There is a lot more money flowing there
compared to other platforms (when you are selling on the platform itself as
opposed to your newsletters).

Podcasts, longer YouTube videos, newsletters, and blog articles have higher
levels of sophistication. People that open your emails don’t have other posts
trying to steal their attention. This is where you will build the deepest
connection and make the most money.

 **3) How To Send Traffic With The Platform**

This is another reason I recommend Twitter as an incredible starting point.
You have creative freedom with your plugs and promotions because you can post
links anywhere (threads are the most powerful way to sell your products
compared to any other platform).

On a platform like Instagram, you can only have 1 link in your bio and can
post links in your stories (and store them in your story highlights). You
can’t post links in your posts or comments.

We will be going over the correct strategies for these on each platform in the
coming sections.

#  YouTube  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

YouTube is difficult.

I was inconsistent for years and couldn’t figure out how to grow consistently.

I am not the best to teach you YouTube as a whole, but I can teach you how to
incorporate it in your content ecosystem so you can bank on high-quality
content (and the audience you’ve built) for growth.

That’s the thing… I couldn’t figure it out, so I built an audience on an
easier platform and now my YouTube is growing organically because of my
ability to send my audience there.

 **Recommended YouTube Equipment & Resources**

YouTube is where things can start getting pricey, that is why I don’t
necessarily recommend it for beginners.

If you want to aim for consistency, you do not need any equipment aside from
somewhere to mount your phone (like a small phone tripod).

You don’t need any fancy editing or B-roll when you are just starting out, but
you WILL grow faster if you have high-quality production.

 **A Camera**

If you want to go more than just your phone, I would recommend starting with
the [Sony a6400](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Alpha-a6400-Mirrorless-
Camera/dp/B07MTWVN3M) and a lens like the [Sigma
30mm](https://www.amazon.com/Sigma-30mm-F1-4-Contemporary-Lens/dp/B01C3SCKI6).
That was my favorite setup but doesn't work for the room I'm currently in.

 **A Microphone**

If you already have a podcast microphone and can mount your camera to a place
where you can use that microphone — you can do that. Record the audio with
Audacity and match it with the audio from your camera.

I have gone through many shotgun-style (top of camera) microphones in my days.
The one I am using now is the highest quality — and most affordable — of all
of them. It is the [Deity](https://www.amazon.com/Super-Cardioid-Directional-
Smartphones-Laptop%EF%BC%8CBodypack-Transmitters/dp/B07VY39B2Y) and is also
what [Nathaniel Drew](https://www.youtube.com/c/nathanieldrewofficial) uses
for his videos. He is one of my mentors that I emulate and ‘swipe’ from on a
consistent basis.

 **Lighting**

There are entire courses on good lighting.

Unless you can afford a professional studio, your best bet is to put your
camera in front of a window and use natural lighting. You can’t get much
better than that.

If you want to add a key light or secondary light, I use these [Neewer tripod
lights](https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-Pieces-Bi-color-Video-
Light/dp/B06XW3B81V).

If you want to add a bit more contrast and color to your background, you can
buy colored string lights or these [video
lights](https://www.amazon.com/ULANZI-Photography-
Rechargeable-2500-9000K-Attraction/dp/B08MDQ3CJY). I used to put these on the
floor facing the wall in my previous videos.

 **Sound Dampeners**

As with everything here, these are optional, but don’t waste your time with
the traditional sound panels that ruin your walls.

These [blanket-style dampeners](https://vocalboothtogo.com/product/sound-
blanket-producers-choice-with-grommets-black-and-white/) are more affordable
and take all echoes out of your room. I wish I found them earlier.

 **B-Roll & Stock**

For B-roll and background music I use
[Storyblocks](https://www.storyblocks.com/).

Take some time to find audio and video that fits the vibe you are trying to
put off, download them, and add them into your video.

 **Editing Software**

I use Adobe Premiere for all of my editing. iMovie and Final Cut Pro are also
great choices.

As with everything tech-related, there are a billion different resources for
learning the basic tools.

When you are just starting out, I would stick with basic jump cuts (just cut
out parts you don’t like and upload a talking-head video).

Don’t overcomplicate it unless you plan on shifting your priority growth
mechanism to YouTube instead of traffic-generating platforms like Twitter,
Instagram, or LinkedIn.

 **How To Repurpose Your Content For YouTube**

Again, this stresses the importance of a high-quality newsletter as the pillar
of all of your content.

Recording my videos takes 30-60 minutes a week.

I sit down, pull up the newsletter on my phone, read a section of it, then
talk to the camera in my own words.

That’s it.

Having YouTube baked into your content ecosystem at the start is a great way
to produce high-quality videos. I plan on doing this until I hit 200K+
subscribers, then I can decide if I want to branch into different styles of
videos.

 **How To Send Traffic With YouTube**

If you plugged certain offers in your newsletter, this should be simple — just
read the promotions as you are reading the newsletter to the camera.

There are other features like timeline posts, shorts, and stories(?) now, but
I am not paying too much attention to those.

Once my audience is larger, I will definitely be testing promotions using
these features (like when I launch a new product or another round of the
cohort.

 **How To Leverage Others' Audiences With YouTube**

I have not mastered this, but it is the same with any other platform:

Reply to YouTube accounts in your niche with value (you will be better at this
than everyone else because you know how to write tweets).

There are a few other methods, but they don’t fit too much in this content
ecosystem:

  * Create commentary or reaction videos — when you create a video about another big YouTuber, you will show up in their search results and they may click and watch.
  * Upload your podcasts to YouTube — I had Rob Lipsett on my podcast at one point, this helped me get a little traction on YouTube.

As with all of these, consistency is key. You aren’t going to grow unless you
use these tactics on a consistent basis. If you don’t plan on having a
consistent guest podcast or creating consistent commentary videos, I wouldn’t
focus on it.

Double down on where you have the most leverage (Twitter, Instagram, or
LinkedIn) and treat YouTube as another layer of authenticity.

Delete for good?

No, keep it

Yes, delete

#  Products & Services  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

If you are an absolute beginner — I want to get this out of your head now:

Do not rely on any platform for the foundation of your income.

  * YouTube adsense
  * Twitter "super follows"
  * Instagram reels

Patreon or other similar platforms are okay — but you will see the best
results (in business AND personal life) if you provide a product or service.

Creating **your own** product or service is the only way you become in full
control of how much money you make.

That is — packaging up the information in your head in a simple, impactful,
and understandable way.

This will require you to grow as a person.

This will require you to develop your skill set.

This will require you to bust through levels of personal development that will
cause massive discomfort.

But — **this is what you become known for.**

 **Types Of Products & Services**

There are 3 types of products and services.

  * Done for you
  * Done with you
  * Do it yourself

Throughout this course, we will be focused on digital products and services.

Why?

  * They are the most accessible, cost nearly $0 to create, and can be sold infinitely once they are built.
  * They allow you to work your way up the experience ladder. The only thing stopping you from charging $100+ for a consulting call is your mind (unless you are an ABSOLUTE beginner).
  * They allow you to get results and establish authority fast. You can use those results for anything else you create.
  * You can change and improve them at any time to make more money.
  * If they are a good product or service, you can expand your offering into physical products, software as a service, or anything else you want to create.

Everyone can and should start with a digital product or service stack.

This allows you to build authority in your space, create a full-time income
for yourself quick, and open up new opportunities for your business.

__

You Are In Control

Start a project right now. Like RIGHT now. Write it down.

The sooner you do this, the sooner you can identify unconscious blindspots and
create a better product or service.

These are not physical products. You can change and improve them at anytime.

**The Evolution Of Your Offer Stack**

When you are just starting out, it doesn't make sense to create a full-blown
digital product.

However, this is heavily dependent on your personal goals and what you talk
about.

In _most_ cases, this is the smartest progression when starting from zero:

 **Step 1) Create a Lead Magnet**

A lead magnet is a way of establishing authority fast.

A lead magnet is a free product that people receive in exchange for their
email.

This allows you to:

  * Show your expertise
  * Build a deeper connection
  * Give immense value that wouldn't do well on social media (because of algorithms)
  * Gives you content ideas to start establishing authority in your emails, articles, and short-form posts
  * Make people aware of their problems and educate them to the point of solving them
  * Allow you to talk about your interests more — because the lead magnet is there for those that want help on what you have expertise in
  * Form the foundation and outline of your first Minimum Viable Offer for step 2 (building a service business)

This will be one of the first things we build out as a project in Digital
Economics.

Don't overthink this yet. Anyone can create a 2-3 page lead magnet based
around one problem in the area you want to become an expert in. Little
experience required.

 **Step 2) Start a Service Business**

Freelancing or consulting (I prefer consulting) with your skill or expertise
of choice.

This is not as daunting as it sounds.

At the start, you will help people for free, so there isn't any pressure to
deliver insane results.

Helping people for free in the DMs or on a call will lead to deeper
connections, potential paid work, and it will shine a light on what you
_don't_ know — so you can learn about it and improve your skill set.

 **Then** you can start charging.

This can be as simple as offering a pack of 4 one-hour-long calls for $500 to
help someone in your area of expertise.

In the case of freelancing, this can be a simple landing page, email, content
writing, or anything else for ~$500.

As you discover:

  * What gets results
  * What skills you have to learn to improve your offer
  * What problem people are really trying to solve (that you only find by talking to these people and immersing yourself in an online environment that they hang out in)

Then you can start to create your own unique system, promise better results,
and increase your prices accordingly.

You don't need a large following to do this.

All you need is perceived authority (brand and content) and the ability to
send a DM like a normal person — which we go over in Non-Needy Networking.

 **Step 3) Turn Your System Into A Product**

Once you have proven results and a replicable process / system that you've
tested on your clients — you can turn it into a product.

Why do this after you've gone the service business route?

Because (hopefully) you've built an audience along the way AND you have
testimonials from the start.

It's guaranteed to sell and free up time for you.

 _ **Buyers buy again**_ — meaning most of your clients at this point will
come from those that purchased your product (so you don't have to spend time
DMing people anymore).

Of course, this is all unpredictable. This is not a path that is set in stone.
If you feel compelled to create a random product or service that isn't
"optimal" — then create it.

What's the worst that can happen? It doesn't sell?

Does that mean you can't make it better and relaunch it when you have a larger
audience?

Nothing is permanent in this game.

You are in full control of your products, services, content, and everything
else.

This should be liberating, not destructive.

Zoom out and focus on consistency.

The one thing that will screw you up from the beginning is the NEED to make
money fast.

If this is the case for you, get a job.

 **Step 4) Expand Your Offering With Complimentary Products**

At this point, you can do really anything you want.

We are building a personal brand.

Everyone has the same problems within the eternal markets.

Every problem has a different method of being solved that is unique to you
(how you solve it).

  * If you want to pivot and try something completely new, you can.
  * If you want to turn your product or service into a software, you can.
  * If you want to take on public speaking gigs relating to your expertise, you can.
  * If you want to build a membership product or community for recurring income, you can.

Anything is possible at this point.

Focus On Results

If I could give you one piece of advice:

**Just start helping people.**

DM someone that you want to meet. Get to know them. Ask them what they are
working on. See if your skills can help with that. Offer to help them for free
and give them tips.

At minimum, you have a connection that respects you. At maximum, you get
results and potential work from them OR referrals.

**An Example To Show You What's Possible**

Let's start with a small, overly attainable goal for beginners:

$50,000 a year (on the low end, I would say $200,000 but that is hard to get
people to believe when they don't have prior awareness or a bad relationship
with money).

Now, this is only a possibility if:

You execute lever-moving tasks on a daily

Learn from your mistakes and constantly iterate

Promote yourself every single day

Understand how to learn by building out real world projects

 _There are 3 options for hitting that $50,000 in a year:_

 **1) Land 4 clients per month at $1000**

This can be a single skill-based freelance service OR a pack of 4 calls
consulting service.

Let's say you do that for 3 months at the beginning, get results, and increase
your prices - then you would only have to land 2 clients per month at $2000.

You can start landing clients with a proper DM method when you have a small
following.

When done right, it would take 5-10 DMs to do this correctly.

You can also write a targeted thread, get eyes on it through DMs or paid
shares, and land clients that way.

As you continue building your audience, you can stop spending so much time on
sending DMs.

As you increase prices, you can charge $2500-$5000 for your services and make
6 figures from client work alone.

 **2) Sell 43 digital products at $99 for $50,000 a year**

Again, there are many ways to do this at many different price points.

But once you have built an audience and content ecosystem that makes sales for
you, this is more than possible.

When I had 500-3000 followers, I was making around $3,500 from digital
products alone because I knew how to leverage other's audiences (next module
on Distribution Networks).

 **3) Do both**

If you only stick to selling one type of offer over the other, you are
shooting yourself in the foot.

The majority of your high-ticket clients will have bought your digital
products beforehand.

Digital products are also a way of "creating your own clients," because you
are educating them to the point of becoming a client.

Now you can focus on selling the digital product, have processes in place to
have them sign on with you, and have a diversified source of income that you
can scale as high as you want.

#  The Experience Model  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Remove from my
favorites")

Keep in mind — this is my philosophy behind personal branding and content.
This section will be more theory than step-by-step processes or systems. Keep
that in mind. This won’t be inherently actionable. Treat it as a seed of
awareness to make sense of over time.

I did not bring this up in the previous module so you can focus your attention
and priorities on a select few interests or skills that you choose to master.

At the end of the day, your unique experience on this Earth **while pursuing
those interests** is what people care about — not the interests themselves.

People care about **how those interests will help impact their life**. Your
interests are the “how.”

They could care less which interest it is. They care about how it will make
their life better.

If I have a desire to get a more lucrative job and you can create a persuasive
argument that shows me web development (an example interest) is the best way
to do that, I will listen to you.

You add firepower to this persuasive argument by considering all aspects of
the lifestyle associated with it. **Your lifestyle is unique.** No matter how
“boring” you may think your lifestyle is — it is not.

Once you have hooked them in with certain aspects of your life experiences, it
is up to you to educate them on how to get there (through authoritative
content, newsletters, and other things like a lead magnet, product, or
service.)

You attract a unique following of people by talking about your life
experiences — your lifestyle. Your life experiences are the “why” behind your
interests. The pains, benefits, and range of emotions associated with your
lifestyle.

 _This is how you start to bridge the gap between “work” and “life.”_

 **Your Domain Of Mastery Is A Vessel For Self-Development (Most Importantly,
Mental Development)**

Your Domain Of Mastery is a structured way of digging deeper into life and
connecting its sub-components. **It is a way of guiding your learning.**

Learning, dissecting, connecting, and teaching is how you start branching into
the iceberg of life itself.

You may not make this connection yet — but all worthwhile paths in life lead
to the same endpoint, _which is life itself._ As you dig deeper and deeper
into your Domain Of Mastery you will realize that everything connects.

This requires a foundation of self-development.

A foundation of self-development creates the opportunity for unlimited unique
content ideas.

Self-development implies that you are actively improving your mind, body,
spirit, finances, and life itself.

 **The most important pillar here is the mind.** Mental expansion and
intellectual development are the foundation of diving deeper into your Domain
Of Mastery.

Think about it… the people that make the most money (and the greatest impact
on the world) are not manual labor workers. There is a reason they are
consistently being phased out.

The people that make the largest impact and most money are the creators,
strategists, visionaries, leaders, and innovators of the world. They CREATE
solutions with their mind.

 **Expanding your mind = increasing your creative potential.**

In the 3rd module of this course, I will be giving you a structured way of
developing your mind and creating unique solutions, perspectives, and
theories.

 **You must become a “thought leader,”** as cringe as that may sound.

 _That means you have to take yourself, your work, and your life seriously._

If you have yet to choose a 3rd complimentary interest for your Domain Of
Mastery, I would highly recommend self-development or mental mastery as a
whole. This will help you master your Domain much faster and create unique
perspectives for your content.

The iceberg of self-development contains things like:

  * Psychology
  * Spirituality
  * Survival
  * Metaphysics
  * Human potential
  * Philosophy
  * Leadership
  * Strategy
  * Learning
  * Creativity
  * Cosmology
  * Human behavior
  * Performance & productivity

In general, understanding life itself and expanding your mind. The things that
will help you create innovative solutions to modern problems (and eventually
make some money doing so)!

Self-development as a whole will increase the impact of whatever money-making
skill you choose to build authority in. Because once you understand how to
develop yourself, you understand how to develop others.

Personal growth = business growth.

My favorite resource that everyone should be exposed to is Actualized.org.

[Listen to this lecture in your free time](https://youtu.be/BqWPqZK-Ikg) and
tell me that you don’t have LOADS of unique content ideas come to mind.

If you want books to read, [here are my
favorites](https://youtu.be/609vZAF0JVI). **Flow and The Art Of Impossible in
particular.**

Everyone that goes through these resources will have their own unique
takeaways based on what sparks their curiosity.

 **Developmental Stages & Removing Saturation**

If everyone talked about what they do, the lessons they’ve learned, and the
interests they are pursuing in a confident and persuasive manner — everyone
would attract the right people.

That is — if you were your true authentic self pursuing your genuine curiosity
while posting online, you would attract the perfect community of people (and
be able to create an income source for yourself by providing a unique product
or service to them).

This is quite possibly the hardest thing to wrap your head around and
understand in this course. Mainly because people are out of touch with their
nature and lack authenticity due to a lack of development in certain areas of
life.

Ken Wilber talks a lot about developmental states and stages.

 **States are a temporary period** — like if you felt extra creative for an
hour or two.

 **Stages are permanent** — like if you developed your mind to a point of a
new baseline level of creativity.

Your job is to dive into each interest of your Domain Of Mastery and develop
your knowledge, skill, and understanding of those areas until you hit a new
stage.

This new stage implies that other people want to reach that stage and will pay
to do so.

Now, you can package up a process that got you to that stage and teach it to
the person that is “1 step behind you.”

In order to reach those new stages of development in any given interest — your
mind will need to develop to match that stage.

 **As you evolve, your content and products will evolve.**

I no longer do freelance, coaching, or client work as a whole. I have reached
a new stage of development and can help others get to those stages.

All of the products I've sold have iterated into something completely
different.

Every time I have evolved, **I have in essence “desaturated” that market.**
(And so have all other one-person businesses, they evolve and open up room for
the next generation).

I can create a ladder to help other people to that next stage and the cycle
goes on.

That is how life works.

This is another reason why the “one-person business model” or creator economy
can never be saturated. Individuals change and evolve so they can teach the
next generation that they align with.

Become A Sense Maker

Your job is to make sense of life to the people that understand you.

The way you make sense of life is by developing yourself and your skills in
your Domain Of Mastery.

Your job is to provide clarity to those that align with your values, vision,
goals, beliefs, and other components of your identity (this is what forms your
perspective on things).

**Try To Find The Lesson In Every Experience**

Stop trying to find your passion. Instead, cultivate a passion for life
itself. All of its highs and lows. It SHOULD be difficult to have passion for
a specific 1-3 things in life because you want to be passionate about
everything.

Seek to understand and learn from everything in life. This makes life 10x more
enjoyable when you start to see the depth in everything you come across.

The worst thing you can do is take everything you learn as law.

  * Tweets
  * Books
  * Articles
  * Podcasts

Anything. You must take what you learned, apply it to your life, and seek to
understand it through experience.

You need to run it through your current perspective, value system, beliefs,
biases, and seek to understand that idea on a deeper level.

You were put on this earth to piece together the puzzle of reality – your
personal brand is how you document your findings.

You understand by questioning everything, piecing things together, and
creating clarity. You are learning, experiencing, and understanding to gain
awareness to create unique solutions (filling in and connecting the dots of
life).

I want you to start thinking of your content as a map.

For the next 3-5 years, your job is to document everything you can make sense
of online. Your content is a map for navigating life from your unique
perspective.

 _Your content is your reality._

 _Your content is a giant story that you are piecing together._

 _Your content is the projection of your mind that creates a world for others
to explore._

 **Attracting Like-Minded People Without Focusing On A "Niche"**

When you target your former, current, and future self by talking about your
experiences, lessons, beliefs, and failures — **you are targeting the perfect
niche**. You are attracting people that want to learn from you. They want to
have those same experiences and are open to diving into the interests that got
you there.

By talking about your life with confidence and conviction is how you target an
ultra-specific type of individual.

Throughout this section, I am telling you that “self-development is an
absolute must.”

I FIRMLY believe that self-development is necessary for an interesting and
fulfilling life. It’s a part of my life philosophy. Others won’t agree. That’s
fine, they won’t get value from my message. That is how it is targeted at a
specific type of person.

Do this enough and you will be attracting a very specific type of person.

I would not be surprised if everyone taking this course is here because of the
“niche” I’ve created by doing this.

 **If you are looking for job opportunities OR have a service targeted at a
more specific business or avatar:**

I would still recommend going this route, but with a few nuances.

You have 2 options that are dependent on your current business goals:

 **1) Build a niche audience slow.**

Audience building in this manner is usually slow because people don't like
being sold from the start. If you have a pitch in your bio, it may even do
more damage than good.

If you _know_ you can get in front of your perfect customer avatar on Twitter
or another platform, you can go this route.

This is where you would create hyper-targeted authority content around your
service and the problems of your customer avatar.

However, an automated direct outreach campaign (or sending resumes) would get
you results much faster — so the second option may be the best option either
way.

 **2) Build a leverageable audience fast.**

By going broad and using The Experience Model and Domain Of Mastery you build
an audience fast.

When you talk about _what you do_ , people remember.

When you educate people on the skills, results, and expertise you have, you
will attract the people interested in those skills (or already using those
skills).

You would attract people that are interested in what you are building. The
people that are interested in that are probably in a similar space as you.

The people that are interested in those skills will potentially have access to
your niche customer avatar and spread your name.

If you talk about marketing (your skill) and how that applies to startups
(your work) even from a beginner, broad level — you are going to attract
startup founders, marketers, and others interested in learning about marketing
or startups.

That network can get you in front of the right people and spread your work as
your audience grows.

In this case, you would focus on long-term leverage by building:

  * Educational content for the lower levels of awareness (the beginner market)
  * Establishing authority by talking about your results, skills, and how that expertise applies to what you do
  * Growing by doing what works on any given platform — writing more broad, high impact content relating to your life experiences (and what we discussed above).

By doing this, you build an audience of 50-100K+ that knows exactly what you
do and can spread your name to a number of people that is 5-10x that amount.

 _Start thinking about the opportunities you will generate with the impact of
30K tweets instead of the results you will get from the 3 you post today._

And, if you ever want to build out a value ladder of offers, pivot your main
offer, create your own customers (through educational content), or not have to
worry about direct outreach, you have the leverage to do that.

 **One example:**

Do copywriters talk about their specific customers' problems? Or do they give
beginner-level tips on copywriting and also post about the lessons they've
learned _while_ copywriting (that are applicable to a much broader audience)?

Do they have a profile that screams "I'm going to close you as a client!"

Or do they _show_ their expertise and let people spread their name for them
(while possibly doing direct outreach with a targeted message on the side)?

It's a difference in education, showing people what you do, and flexing your
expertise without targeting a hyper-specific person.

 **In Summary (Focus On This)**

I am telling you not to shy away from posting your beliefs, ideas, thoughts,
experiments, insights, and anything else that crosses your mind (that can be
woven into a high-performing tweet).

Something as simple as this hits all of the requirements for an engaging,
polarizing, and authentic post:

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28913212_1655820266CBfdickie_tweet.png)

We will dive into attention and engagement soon, but can you see how Dickie:

  * Catches attention with a pattern interrupt (squiggly lines)
  * Uses numbers to capture and hold attention further
  * Implies a transformation
  * Uses confidence and conviction to polarize hot and cold coffee drinkers (meaning they will comment their stance and boost engagement)
  * The image “flexes” his lifestyle with something as simple — and what could be uninteresting to those he doesn’t want in his audience — as a journal

This is masterful for such a simple and seemingly innocent post.

Don’t become neurotic about ONLY posting about your interests or areas of
expertise. That is not how you create a unique and timeless personal brand
(but is still necessary to fulfill the 3 pillars of social leverage).

This is another reason why Twitter should be the center of all of your
content. It is the perfect testing ground, it is raw, and you can post as many
times as you’d like without much repercussion (unlike any other platform).

Then, you can take your best content and cross-post to other platforms.

Your Niche Is You

Don't be afraid to talk about your life, experiences, and expertise. You are
attracting people like you — meaning they like what you like and want to do
what you do. You are the leader of your followers.

#  The Content Synthesis System  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my
favorites")

If you want to create irreplaceable content that blows people’s minds — you
need a database of high-signal information to pull from.​​​​​​​

> Your reader wants to be entertained and receive tools they can use
> immediately. That means your book must be sprinkled with anecdotes and
> useful, practical, hands-on exercises: invented or re-invented by the
> author.” — Nicholas Boothman

  

That quote sums things up perfectly (and was in my database I’ve been
building… see what I did there ;))

While most creators go “off the dome” and can’t articulate their main points
at any given time, you will begin developing key concepts that your brand is
known for.

This will come in handy for:

  * Podcast appearances (you will sound smart)
  * Long-form content (so you can entertain your reader)
  * Unique perspectives across all other content (you will become a better storyteller)

First, we need to create a system for researching all of the content we’ve
been talking about.

The idea generation methods we used previously are still the “go-to” for
validating ideas that will perform well online — because you need to grow.

This content synthesis and research system will give you unique ways of
fleshing out those validated ideas.

That way you can be sure your content will perform well, but the way you
deliver the message will blow every other creator out of the water.

 **The Pieces Of Your Content Synthesis System**

All of this is up for you to test and find the consumption method that works
best for you.

I have tried multiple different ways, but what is _currently_ working well for
me is:

  * Go on a 30-60 minute walk around noon
  * Throw on a YouTube video or audiobook I want to listen to
  * Note high-signal insights and ideas “The Queue”
  * Write out summaries and how I make sense of things while walking
  * Organize it into its respective location in the Command Center (develop the idea further, use it in a newsletter, or turn it into a tweet)

This is vastly different from before and will continue to change over time
based on how I enjoy consuming at the time (and what I have time for).

The points listed above are a simple, streamlined, and free way of doing this.

I want to give you all of the tools so you can experiment for yourself — just
keep in mind that many of these are paid tools (they are NOT necessary).

 **1) Readwise**

Readwise allows you to transfer highlights from Medium, Shortform, Kindle, and
other content software and store them in Notion. From Notion, you can access
these highlights and move them around your Command Center however you please —
or just leave them there to access at another time.

Readwise also allows you to save tweets, threads, and other articles to
Notion.

This makes things more convenient, but if you don’t want to pay for it you can
always just note things down in The Queue manually.

Out of this entire list, Readwise is the most important to me. I use it for
saving specific quotes and highlights from Medium and Kindle that I can refer
to later.

Check out [Readwise](https://readwise.io/) here.

 **2) Pocket**

Pocket is another option for saving most things you find on the internet. I
have not used this much as I never really plan to go back and read what I
bookmark, but it is an option.

Check out [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/en/) here.

 **3) Airr**

Airr is a podcast listening software that allows you to save clips from
podcasts.

Again, convenient, but you can always manually note your findings in The Queue
and organize it accordingly.

Check out [Airr](https://www.airr.io/) here.

 **4) Shortform**

These are book summary apps that allow you to get the big ideas from top books
(and some nuance). I like using these apps while I am reading or listening to
a book. Doing both helps me remember big ideas but also have a lot of nuance.
The nuance is usually what gives me the perspectives I need to piece together
compelling stories.

Check out [Shortform](https://Shortform.com/dan) here (they were kind enough
to give a yearly discount for those that use my link!).

 **5) Medium and Blogs**

We’ve discussed this before, but articles are a great way to generate
validated ideas and use as inspiration to structure your writing.

These usually give some unique perspectives you can pull from.

If you have a favorite blog, newsletter, or Substack — consider adding that to
your content research routine.

Check out [Medium](https://medium.com/) here.

 **6) Audible and YouTube premium**

These are the two I am currently using the most.

Why? Longer form content is:

  * Something that most of the world doesn’t consume seriously
  * It has the most anecdotes, interesting facts, nuances, perspectives, etc that I can use

I will listen to these on my walks, listen intently (like a walking
meditation), and note ideas with potential use.

Check out [Audible](https://www.audible.com/) and [YouTube
Premium](https://www.youtube.com/premium) here.

 **7) Physical books and Kindle**

I would personally recommend having a rotation of 5-10 books that impact you
on a deep level.

There are books out there that you resonate with deeply. If you haven’t read
them a second or third time — you are missing out on crucial information that
you missed last time.

The combination of big ideas from these books is what has formed the
foundation for my own book. They are pillars in my life and help me make sense
of the world. Why would I not understand every facet of those big ideas and
form my own philosophy around them?

My favorite combination:

  * Read a [Shortform](https://Shortform.com/dan) summary to see if I am interested in reading more
  * Purchase and listen to an audiobook on Audible (and note insights straight into The Queue)
  * Purchase the book on Kindle to read at night and export important highlights with Readwise into Notion (then I can develop those ideas or use them in newsletters or articles).

 **8) Your Favorite Ideas**

There will be content you come across that starts to form the foundation of
your worldview. These are usually the most impactful book chapters, videos,
podcasts, and other content pieces that you feel compelled to build on top of.

These are the content pieces that make everything “click” for you. They make
everything make sense. That is your job in this space, to make the most sense
to the group of people that you make sense to.

 **The Point With All Of This**

The main goal with this system is to have a place to store any and all
information you come across throughout your day. No matter where you are
getting the information from.

To do this well, you have to search for the congruent voices that make sense
to you. This will make you look forward to your research sessions and allow
you to be consistent with it.

By having a plethora of tools at our disposal, we can test methods for
capturing high signal information no matter where we are getting it from.
Podcasts, blogs, books, tweets, etc.

This adds another layer of intention behind everything you do. You will start
to gain a deeper appreciation for your work. Every aspect of life starts to
gain practical application in a way that can impact and raise the collective
well-being.

 **Nuances And Words Of Advice:**

There have been a few nuances I’ve learned from using this system over time.

 **1) The Queue can add up fast.**

If you are like me, you’ll want to put anything and everything inside The
Queue. Do this enough times and you will get extremely overwhelmed. You won’t
want to develop those ideas (in the next section).

In this case, the best thing you can do is clear out all of the information
that you are “saving for later” and don’t have an immediate use for.

If those ideas were important, you’ll come across them again when you have a
use case for them.

 **2) Don’t consume more than you have to.**

This is a balance between creativity and productivity.

When you are building out a new project, you may have all of the information
you need for the next 2-4 weeks. If you already know what you need to create,
content consumption becomes less necessary.

Exhaust the majority of your creative resources before refueling for the next
round.

 **3) This is all up to personal preference.**

If you are a beginner, this process may hurt your content creation instead of
help it. At the end of the day, this is what works for me — it may not work
for your specific interests and goals pertaining to content creation.

As with life, your job is to experiment and iterate on a sustainable idea
generation system — preferably one that becomes more complex with time (so
others have a hard time keeping up).

__

This Shouldn't Be A Burden

If all of the information you are storing is overwhelming (instead of
inspiring) you will need to iterate on your process.

A good practice is only noting down the things that have immediate use cases
OR fit somewhere within your vision.

Delete for good?

No, keep it

Yes, delete

#  Action Steps & My Entire Process  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my
favorites")

All of this is optional.

There are people making $1M+ a year from Twitter alone.

Branching out is a matter of increasing each pillar of social leverage and
should be treated as such.

This is a mindset shift that needs to be made:

You don’t only branch out to a new platform for the sake of the “growth”
pillar.

You do so for the “authority” and “authenticity” pillars as well.

That is why I started my newsletter and podcast in the first place — I was
tired of not talking about what I wanted on Twitter, so I solved that problem
by branching out.

Now I can post almost anything that will result in growth on Twitter and send
those that want more to my podcast or newsletter.

After branching out a few more times, I have built an ecosystem that covers
all bases and makes me an authority on a plethora of subjects.

 **Another thing to keep in mind:**

When you branch out, keep the system as simple as possible.

If you don’t plan on making that platform your “full-time job” for 6+ months,
do the minimum amount of work you can so you can continue to focus most of
your energy on Twitter and your newsletter.

If you get overwhelmed because you are trying to branch out too quickly
without systemizing the process, don’t hesitate to cut it out entirely and
come back to it later.

I’ve “quit” Instagram, YouTube, and LinkedIn multiple times. 5+ on each to be
exact. It didn’t matter. All I had to do was test a new system, leverage
others’ audiences, and eventually refine the system to a point of
sustainability (while still growing consistently).

If you aren’t growing and it is overwhelming, stop doing it until you have a
better strategy.

 **How I Would Structure My Expansion**

If I were to do it all over again, here is exactly what I would do.

 **1) Copy-paste my top tweets of the day to Instagram in 5 minutes every
morning.**

After I had been posting on Twitter for a while, I had a huge backlog of
tweets that I could go back to, screenshot, format in Canva, and post them on
Instagram.

This gave me some buffer room and allowed me to screenshot my tweets for the
day to post to my story. I still do this. I screenshot the text portion of my
tweets every morning and use them to keep my stories active.

Once you have a network you can start growing with on Instagram, you can start
to incorporate graphics, visuals, reels, or other post styles.

(Don’t listen to everyone telling you that reels are necessary. They resulted
in 0 growth for me and I keep seeing people not getting any traction with
them. Just focus on good writing, as always).

 **2) Copy, paste, and expand on my top tweets on LinkedIn.**

LinkedIn is another writing platform.

If you want to go the lazy and simple route, just copy and paste your tweets
over to LinkedIn.

But, since you have more room to expand, I would recommend expanding on
certain points of your post, trying to create a more compelling hook, and
adding more call to actions.

 **3) Creating a podcast to enhance the authenticity pillar of your brand.**

Creating a 10-minute podcast for the sake of added authenticity in your brand
shouldn’t take longer than 30 minutes a week.

All you have to do is pick a topic, riff on it for a bit and give your
thoughts, export and upload it to Anchor, copy-paste your normal description,
and then promote it on Twitter and at the end of your newsletter.

 **4) YouTube comes last in this process.**

Once you get better at speaking and articulating your points with the podcast,
AND you have a database of ideas to create fusion-style content — YouTube is
the logical next step.

I would start when you can make a full commitment and invest in a camera like
the Sony a6400 mentioned previously.

It takes me about 30-60 minutes to record the video. My roommate edits mine,
but if you only do jump cuts (and no fancy B-roll) it shouldn’t take too long.

 **My Entire Content Ecosystem & Process**

This is where the full power of the Command Center is unleashed.

This is where everything starts to come together and you get on a weekly 3-4
hour workday cadence.

Keep in mind, you will have to prioritize certain platforms if you are
building out a product or service.

I wouldn’t be able to do this with a full-time freelance or consulting
service. That’s why this was a gradual process.

As I increased my leverage, I decreased the amount of client work I had and
refocused my efforts on building even MORE leverage to keep product sales high
and consistent.

Delete for good?

No, keep it

Yes, delete

#  Distribution Networks  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

_How do you make money online?_

It's simple, and the same as any other type of **transaction** in life
(whether it be social, financial, etc).

 **Remember** : a transaction of any kind must be beneficial to _all_ parties
involved. Not just the buyer and seller — also the provider, employees, and
everything else involved. Ethics.

You need 2 things:

 **1) An Offer**

An offer is a product or service.

Mainly, an offer is the **specific desired outcome that you are promising**
they will get when they purchase and use it.

You are selling a desired _benefit_ that helps resolve their _pain._

Humans are emotional beings, not logical.

We are constantly looking for minor or major ways to change the quality of our
lives.

 **2) Interested Traffic**

Traffic is people.

When you build an audience and plug your product, you are sending traffic to
it. You are getting eyeballs on it. That is the only way you make sales.

Your offer isn't just going to magically appear in front of peoples eyes.

You have to be intentional about where you are placing the offer, how it is
perceived to that person, and place a heavy focus on how it impacts their
life.

The same thing goes for dating — if you suck at dating, there's one of two
problems:

 _1) Your offer sucks (you don't have enough perceived value to them)._

 _2) Your traffic sucks (you aren't putting yourself in an environment where
potential dates are)._

We will dive into this more when we talk about awareness, **but what if the
traffic isn't interested?**

It is your job to educate them to the point of making them aware.

If you are selling a high level service but you are attracting beginners with
your content — do you have free or paid resources (or content) in place to get
them to the point of buying your high level service?

This is what a 'funnel' is in a nutshell.

You take people from _unaware to aware_ and _beginner level to your level_.

 **Your Personal Distribution Network**

I understand that Facebook, Google, and other paid advertisements are helpful
— but why would you rely on those when you can _build_ a distribution network
(and have traffic that you can send at will?)

 **Take this as an example:**

I get 5-10 million impressions per month on Twitter _alone_.

Close to triple that when you account for other platforms.

(This would normally cost anywhere from $35,000 - $70,000 with paid ads.)

 **If you can get 10 people to buy a $27 product per day, you make 6 figures a
year.**

That means you need to get **400 of those 5-10 million people** a day to click
on your page.

If you have a ***low* 2.5% conversion rate**... you make 6 figures.

And that's on a $27 product... imagine if you charge more, promote more, and
have other offers in place to extend lifetime value.

 _Let your mind toy with that idea for a bit to show you what's possible if
you take this seriously._

Now, how do you build a network of potential traffic sources that you can send
to your products nearly on demand?

 **1) Your Audience**

This is self-explanatory. You create content that pulls in a following. If you
focus on awareness and education, you create interested traffic.

Start by dominating one platform — then use your validated content, social
proof, and network to grow rapidly on other platforms (and funnel your
audience there).

 **2) Your Email List**

You can get banned from platforms at any time for making a stupid mistake.

You cannot, however, have the CSV file of emails taken from you. They are
yours.

If you get 'banned', which is unlikely, you just transfer them to another
email provider.

If you have limiting beliefs about email marketing and its ability to make
sales — eradicate them from your psyche now. Whatever they are, they are
wrong. Don't assume what you haven't experienced.

 **3) Your Network**

I have ~350,000 followers.

I have made friends along my journey that have also grown a large following.

They are my friends, and always happy to help support me — as am I happy to
support them — because we understand that cooperation is infinitely better
than competition. _Buyers buy again._

If we all get 5-10 million impressions per month and one of us does a
promotion for our offer...

That's 5-10+ friends of mine sending _all of our traffic to one offer._

This stresses the importance of learning how to network, socialize, and make
friends online (like you would in real life).

We will make this easy with The Non-Needy Networking process in the Bachelors
curriculum.

 **4) A Community**

If you have the bandwidth to start a free or paid community, this is another
traffic source for you to promote to.

Think of a platform like Discord, Circle, Telegram, or somewhere else to build
authority away from the algorithm.

 **All of these form your Personal Distribution Network.**

As this grows, you gain leverage. You can begin to free up time and focus on
bigger levers.

This also brings up the concept of social capital.

I have traded retweets for Instagram shares, LinkedIn comments, money, and
really anything else.

This can also lead to brand deals, public speaking gigs, job opportunities,
and people spreading your message throughout their daily life.

 _Money isn't the only currency when you have leverage, distribution, and
social capital._

Focus On Leverage, Not Money

What do you have that other people want?

Prior experience? An audience? Necessary skills?

Forget the money for a bit. Develop your value and practice offering it to
others without expectation of anything in return.

**How To Make Money When You Don't Have Distribution**

I just told you to forget about money — but this is worth understanding.

When you don't have an audience or other distribution built, you have to rely
on outreach, referrals, and connections.

Meaning, you have to form the habit of DMing and meeting people that you can
offer your value to.

You may not believe this, but higher ticket offers are easier to sell than
lower ticket offers.

  * You don't need an audience
  * You can make your offer hyper specific
  * You can talk people through the awareness and sales process
  * You can walk through a "sales page" on a call with them

If you create a minimum viable consulting offer (like a pack of 4 calls for
$500-$1000), you can start earning immediately.

This is why I recommend starting with a service business, making some money,
getting results, and packaging up that system into a product.

Also, you don't have to be potential clients all the time.

Reach out to people that have:

  * Less followers than you
  * Similar followers as you
  * More followers than you
  * People that you would die to work with (the ones whose business you are passionate about, that excitement will show in your outreach message).

 _Want to start on the right foot?_

Give them a compliment on a piece of content that didn't go viral. A piece of
content that you know is meaningful to them, that you vibe with, and that will
pique their interest.

People like being praised for their work — especially the work that not many
people noticed.

Then, ask them what they do and what they are working on.

If they mention something you can help with, offer help.

__

Start Small

Get in the habit of messaging 5 people a day. It can be anyone. The goal is to
get used to meeting new people.

When you see a post that crosses your timeline that you really like, message
the person telling them what resonated with you and start a conversation.

Delete for good?

No, keep it

#  The Start Of Your Life's Work  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my
favorites")

This is one thing that I believe holds most creators back:

They don’t take their message seriously. They don’t aim for quality. Every
single post is not the most impactful message they have the power to give.

Or… there is no possibility of taking it seriously because of scarcity around
money. Which opens up the option of pursuing another business model or getting
a job to fulfill that need – opening up room to be your authentic self and not
unconsciously come off as needy.

Lastly, one may be afraid of growth itself and the change that is demanded by
it — making them unconsciously dilute their message and wonder “why isn’t this
working for me?!” It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

While most creators are focused on their next content idea... we are focus on
creating a body of work that will leave a mark on the world.

Even if you don't leave a mark on the world, this mindset alone will bring
fulfillment into your life and work — you will have FUN and feel compelled to
deliver the best work that you are able to.

 **The BIG Problem You Want To Solve**

Your life's work will be based around the big problem you want to solve in the
world.

This is what many people would consider your "life's purpose."

This big problem will have a _plethora of smaller problems that need to be
solved along the way._ (Usually, the problems that exist in your life right
now that will lead to you uncovering the BIG problem).

This big problem can be a big problem that you are trying to solve in your own
life (because everyone has the same problems, you can work to solve this
immediately and help others do the same).

As with everything here, it is best to:

  * Get your first iteration out to gain some awareness.
  * Let your subconscious munch on all of this while going about your day.
  * Note down ideas, experiences, and insights that come to you as you go about your day.
  * (You can capture these fast inside "The Queue" page in the Command Center.
  * Turn those ideas into content and potential parts of a system you can sell.

I cannot tell you what this big problem is. You have to write out what you
_think_ it is so you can uncover what it actually is with time and experience.

 **Becoming A Visionary**

What will the world look like after you solve that problem?

What will your life look like after you solve that problem?

What will your followers' lives look like after you solve that problem?

What is the transformation that you are helping other people achieve along the
way?

HOW are you going to solve that problem with your interests and Domain Of
Mastery?

Think about it...

Jesus was a visionary

Buddha was a visionary

Elon is a visionary

Every single leader that you look up to has a vision for how their work will
impact the world.

Your vision is what you are leading your followers towards. This is what you
are going to help them actualize in their own life — because humans are
emotional beings, not logical. They want a higher quality of life and better
future for themselves.

 _What are the steps to get there and how are you going to deliver those steps
with your content and products?_

 **Considering Your Anti-Vision**

What is it that you are working away from? This will help you to start
thinking in terms of polarity.

Are you hell-bent on not being mediocre? Write about how to not end up
mediocre.

Do you not want to live in a big city? Why?

What do you not want to look or feel like? Why?

Your audience is your tribe. What is your tribe working towards? What are they
working to avoid?

 **Your Value Code**

If you want to keep this problem away, you will have to adopt and cultivate
the values that help keep that problem away.

If you have a problem that is solved by improving and systemizing your health,
you will need to adopt health as a value and iterate on your "do's" and
"dont's" for that value.

Delete for good?

No, keep it

Yes, delete

#  The Epistemic Method  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

The Epistemic Method is a fancy way of saying The Scientific Method — but for
your knowledge.

That is what we are as _unique_ creators — Knowledge Workers that package up
their findings and put them out in the world in the form of content, videos,
audio, books, and other forms of media.

Remember: cognitive, mental, or intellectual development is necessary if you
want your work to evolve over time. By doing this on a consistent basis, you
are developing your mind.

If you want to be truly creative, you need a lot of information to pull from.

If you want a lot of information to pull from, you need to consistently expose
yourself to new information (you need to expand your awareness / consciousness
by pursuing your curiosity).

You need a mental (or digital) database of validated ideas that you can treat
as digital legos for piecing together compelling content.

The traditional scientific method is used to make new discoveries through
testing, experimentation, and iteration on the data you receive.

With the “Epistemic Method” we will be focused on a few things:

  *  **Observation** — you need to observe every aspect of your life and the information you are consuming. Note ideas that come to mind.
  *  **Research** — you must research for more ideas, data, references, and other things that will make your argument more credible.
  *  **Experiment** — you experiment with the idea by dissecting it and seeing all of its parts. You can now piece those parts together in different ways.
  *  **Discoveries** — you make discoveries through experimentation and share them with the world.
  *  **Theories** — over time you will start to make connections between your own discoveries and create your own theories.
  *  **Processes** — you will be testing processes to come up with a replicable method that gets results.

You can start to see how the All-In-One Template inside Notion reflects this.
Writing longer-form content becomes easy when you have re-usable puzzle
pieces.

 **Running An Experiment & Making New Discoveries**

When you run an experiment, you dissect something. You break it down into it’s
parts to gain a deeper understanding of what comprises the whole.

Like when you took apart pens as a kid. You unscrewed the pen, took out the
little plastic thing holding the ink, played with the spring, and started to
understand how it all works together.

Once you do this, you can not only explain what a pen is… but you can explain
how it works, why it works that way, who it works best for, and what other use
cases it can have.

You can also play around with the parts and give them new use cases.

This is what we are doing, but with the ideas we collect from the Intelligent
Imitation process.

That is the first step, having an idea to dissect.

By dissecting the idea, we can dive deeper into its parts, understand the
**depth** behind it, and open up room for better ideas (because your
competition isn’t doing this).

Here some ideas that you can choose to dissect:

 **1) Quotes or Tweets**

Are there quotes that make you think “Damn I wish I wrote that?”

Well, whats stopping you from understanding the depth behind it and creating
your own way of saying it? (Usually, your mind and limiting beliefs behind
taking your message seriously is what’s stopping you. Authority is perceived.
The only reason you take authors seriously is because they wrote a book based
on what they have learned prior.)

You can use your own tweets for this as well. This will help you create and
understand the depth behind your ideas.

 **2) Thoughts & Ideas That Come To Your Mind**

As you are reading, writing, consuming, or just going about life — practice
being observant of the ideas and thoughts that pop into your head.

With this method, anything can be turned into content. Anything. It’s all a
game of packaging up words, ideas, and thoughts into a structure that guides
the reader to potential engagement.

This can be treated as a self-reflection and journaling exercise. Are there
negative thoughts that you want to understand and reframe through your
content? Write them down.

 **3) Previous Ideas Or Talking Points Of Yours**

As you create content in all different forms — writing, speaking, visual (any
other of the 5 senses) — you will start to gain a deeper understanding of the
point you are trying to get across.

This will spark new mental pathways to go down. This is how you truly become
an expert in any given topic. You follow the endless branches that one idea
can take you down.

If you want to get philosophical, this is how you become more conscious. You
realize that everything connects infinitely.

In essence, you are creating a web of ideas that you can connect and combine
(like digital legos) for your writing and creations. This is where things
start to get fun.

Once you have an idea you want to dissect, what does the process entail?

  *  **Write out the idea** — start a new experiment in “The Mind” area of the Notion Command Center.
  *  **Add a reference** — if the idea sparked from something you are consuming, note where you got it from.
  *  **Summarizing it in your own words** — how would you make sense of the idea? How does it make sense to you at your current stage of development? That is how it will make sense to the people you can help.
  *  **Optional** — write out common problems, objections, benefits, metaphors, and personal experiences to set yourself up for great content for that idea. (You will be doing this when you write long-form anyway.)

We are using this process for content creation — but if you want to dive a bit
deeper and have a guided challenge for this, you can download my [7 Days To
Genius Ideas course for free here.](https://7daystogeniusideas.com)

Keep in mind that the setup will be a bit different in that course. I would
encourage you to keep everything you are learning here in mind. Use The
Creator Command Center instead of the Notion template that is provided in that
course.

__

An All-In-One Solution

This is a journaling, idea generation, note-taking, and content creation
process all in one.

When you have an idea, immediately jot it down in “The Queue” and you can come
back to it later.

**Making New Discoveries**

From all of the information that you wrote out in the experiment template, how
would you summarize it in one sentence?

Can you create your own quote-like impactful way of getting that point across?

How can you help someone understand the complexity of what you wrote in a
simple way?

These are the BIG ideas that much of your content will revolve around.

In essence, you are developing your ability to create profound insights that
have depth behind them.

 **Formulating A Process**

You are in the business of solving your own problems (and the problems of
others). You solve problems by creating and testing a process that gets
results. These processes can be used for consulting, freelancing, or packaged
up into a digital product.

From the problems that your experiment above presents, can you think of steps
that will help people overcome those problems?

This is something you will be improving over time to get better results for
those you are helping. Don’t worry about getting all of the steps 100% perfect
the first time around. Systems are created from consistent positive and
negative feedback.

 **Bonus points:** contemplate a compelling name for your process. If people
use your process, they will talk about it and attribute their success to your
unique system. This spreads your name, gives you more authority, and of course
— get’s results for others.

Processes can be reused throughout much of your content, but under different
lenses and perspectives.

This is one big reason I stress doing things your own way and figuring things
out for yourself. It will take time, but _**coming up with unique processes
that solve problems in your own life is the best way to monetize your
account.**_

Why? Because you understand the real-world relatable problems that others are
facing, you’ve tested various ways of solving it, and you’ve come up with a
unique process that catches attention. People will pay for that. (This entire
course is a culmination of processes I’ve developed.)

#  Attention & Engagement Psychology  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my
favorites")

_**People don’t remember what you say, they remember how you make them
feel.**_

This is worth repeating:

Humans are emotional beings, not logical.

99% of the population have not developed themselves to the point of being free
from — or in control of — their ego.

That is the foundation of capturing and holding attention.

Poking your reader’s ego.

Feeding it = making them feel “good.”

Starving it = making them feel “bad.”

If you can take people on an emotional journey of love, hate, excitement,
deceit, calmness, and any other emotion that eventually ends in a benefit for
their life — you have mastered the art of content creation.

 **Dan's 10 Commandments Of Capturing Attention**

As you are scrolling through social media or just reading content in general —
try to keep an eye out for these tactics being used. That is the best way to
solidify this information in your head. Notice when your attention is being
captured and question “why.”

There are many ways to capture attention. I’ve found these to be the most
replicable and practical (number 8 is the most important):

 **1) Specific Numbers**

Using numbers in your hooks, headlines, or tweets will make people stop to see
what the numbers relate to.

These can be in the form of:

  *  **Statistics** — “There are 7 billion people on this earth”
  *  **Dollar amounts** — “Apples new $1175 iPhone has this new feature”
  *  **Metrics** — “I sent 322 cold emails” or “After 293 days…”
  *  **Lists** — “7 bad habits that are preventing you…”

The more specific the number is, the more it catches peoples attention.

If you can’t make it super specific, that’s fine. Don’t stress it.

Here’s a recent example from me that was the deciding factor in many people
joining this cohort:

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28913677_1655821721wcb1534162287329693699.png)

 **2) Pattern Interrupts**

A pattern interrupt is something that breaks people out of their normal
conditioned patterns.

If someone is scrolling on Twitter and used to a lot of political commentary,
a well formatted list tweet will make them stop their scroll.

Most of the things in this list are pattern interrupts.

 **3) Negativity Bias**

They human brain is wired to remember and pay attention to negativity.

This does not mean you have to be negative all the time.

It means you need to use the negative forms of words.

If you are saying something positive, but the point is better illustrated in
its negative form, use that.

“You are going to achieve great things.”

Compared to:

“You will never hit rock bottom again.”

The second is most potent. We remember negativity. It is the most relatable
aspect of many peoples’ lives.

It can still be a positive message while leveraging the reader’s negativity
bias.

 **4) Group Callout**

This is simple, call out the specific person you are talking to.

  * If you are in your 20’s…
  * Calling all creators, coaches, and freelancers!
  * Fathers are a gift to humankind…

Even if your audience doesn’t fall into the specific group you are calling
out, it will allow them to “pick a side” and compare themselves to what you
are saying.

I talked about bodybuilders the other day. Even if people don’t consider
themselves one, it helps paint a picture that they can relate to:

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28913698_1655821813Z4X1537035886902366211.png)

If someone talks about being a father, I can still relate because I will be a
father one day. I will still pay attention to and take the advice.

This also works when it comes time to promote. You can call out exactly who
the promotion is for and paint a picture of the problems they are struggling
with.

 **5) Problem Callout**

Calling out the pains or problems people are experiencing will also make them
relate to the post.

MOST people have encountered the same problem or pain as everyone else
throughout their life.

If you can describe the feeling accurately, you have attention at your
fingertips.

You don’t have to be dead on with this. Simply describing pain points will
have people trying to relate their experiences to it. If they can relate, they
will engage.

Here’s an example of calling out a pain as simple as “feeling terrible:”

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28913717_1655821863V6u1475819335277031427.png)

 **6) Potential Benefit**

The opposite of calling out a problem. Again, pains and benefits. Your mind
needs to think in pains and benefits. That is your unique “why” behind
whatever “what” or “how” you are writing about.

 **7) Social Proof**

Again this is authoritative and implied an information gap.

When you flex your results or credentials, people automatically assume that
you know more than them. They will take your content more seriously and read
to find the information they are “missing.”

This works 100x better when it isn’t viewed as a “flex.”

Justin Welsh is the current king of this:

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28913731_1655821914gRW1532336260521635840.png)

Use social proof to illustrate a point you are trying to make.

 **8) Confidence & Conviction**

 ** _This is by far the most important point here._**

You can create highly impactful tweets with confidence alone — it allows other
aspects of attention-grabbing to fall into place.

You are right about everything at this very point in time in relation to your
goals, vision, beliefs, values, and everything else that forms your
perspective of reality.

Your job is to have confidence and conviction in your beliefs and a credible
or clear argument to back them up (if you have to).

Everyone is on social media to be told what to do in a confident way. Nobody
is secure in their actions, choices, and beliefs. They are looking for someone
to confirm them with confidence and give them that clarity to act.

Tools you can use to sound more confident:

  * Eliminate words that imply uncertainty
  * Speak in absolutes when possible
  * Exaggerate your point to add energy

Of course, do not abuse these for the sake of engagement.

Rather than saying:

 _“It may be wise if some people developed their skillset.”_

Say:

 _“It is crucial that everyone on planet earth develops their skillset.”_

Just by being confident, the words flow easier and the writing is more
impactful.

I can go on to back that argument up with statistics or more creative
firepower that I have in my mind.

Here is an example of me being confident in what I was saying:

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28913748_1655821978Gwj1522144576768823296.png)

This tweet got featured in a big newsletter and sparked a lot of controversy.

People were arguing whether or not it was the “greatest” skill. Some were
proposing what their greatest skill was.

This made people comment and quote tweet, leading to more engagement and
impressions.

I wrote this tweet in the moment when I had executed on an idea quickly. Doing
that gave me a lot of joy, so I wanted to share that joy with others. It
worked.

Is it 100% correct? No.

Was it 100% correct when I wrote it, through my perspective, relating to my
personal experience?

Yes. At the time I was 100% convinced that that was the greatest skill.

I went on to add nuance in the replies. If I had added nuance in the actual
tweet, it wouldn’t have done as well and opened up the opportunity to be
featured in a big newsletter.

The people YOU want to attract aren’t the people that “hate” on your work.

Here is one other — a bit more extreme — example. Can you sense the
motivational and practical energy “flowing through the screen?”

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28913767_16558220315Q21538861422779764738.png)

By the way, these types of high-energy advice posts pull in quite a bit of
followers.

In summary — have some conviction behind what you are saying. This is not a
skill that needs to be trained. It’s just a matter of writing the words in the
most impactful way. Leaders don’t dance around the point they are trying to
get across.

 **9) Active Voice**

Active voice implies that there is a story. It eases people into what you are
saying.

Passive voice is often boring and gives away the “mini-story” too early. There
is no anticipation that makes people want to figure out what happened next.

When you are practicing writing tweets, [go through this
article](https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/style/ccs_activevoice/) and edit
out any passive voice you are using.

This also helps with being perceived as confident.

 **10) Warnings & Cautionary Advice**

What should people look out for when they are trying to achieve something?

Can you warn them of something they will encounter as they are trying to reach
where you are now?

When you are doing your weekly reflection, or just reflecting on your life,
what roadblocks can you help people navigate?

This is best illustrated with this tweet. I hit on a hot topic like dopamine
and warned them of another hot topic (then wrapped it up with confidence).

This sparked a LOT of controversy, but I have research to back up that point
AND gave nuance in the replies to build a deeper connection with my audience:

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28913790_1655822102Oyo1463903320540602373.png)

 **What Holds Attention?**

Once the curiosity loop is opened, the mind feels committed to figuring out
the rest of the story.

That is what holds attention — crafting a compelling story.

Stories are layers of metaphors, concepts, perspectives, and experiences that
take people on a journey.

People want to understand the entire story. They want to know what came
before, during, and after any given event (from capturing attention).

Here are 2 things to keep in mind when it comes to holding attention:

 **1) Structure**

We aren’t in high-school anymore. Long, professional paragraphs don’t matter
and reduce readability. Especially on Twitter — people log on that platform to
escape the professional world.

How do you improve the structure of all of your content?

  *  **Bullet lists** — use numbers, bullets, and other tactics that help you break apart what you are saying. These lists create a “story” in themselves.
  *  **Line breaks** — use line breaks whenever possible, but don’t just add line breaks for the sake of it. Be creative. Use line breaks to emphasize specific sentences and help your writing flow.
  *  **Starting short and concise** — Use shorter sentences or paragraphs at the start of your content. Capture attention with short and punchy statements, then let loose and get creative with how your sentences flow.
  *  **Break apart sentences** — use parenthesis and “—” dashes over commas. This sentence is too long (until I make people want to know what are in these parenthesis).

Here is an example of all of the above in one hook:

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28913865_1655822198B0D1534877477620879362.png)

 **2) Novel Perspectives**

This requires you to get the bulk of your ideas from books, podcasts, or other
longer-form content that gives more nuance to certain ideas.

Novelty increases dopamine levels in the brain. It brings more clarity to an
idea that has been talked about over and over.

If you are getting all of your content from Twitter while trying to grow on
Twitter — you will probably end up with the same perspective as everyone else.

Metaphors, personal experiences, and creating new concepts is how you achieve
this.

This will be our prime focus in future modules, so hold tight on this for now
(but keep it in mind so you can start making connections as you consume).

I was reading an article, learned about how a glass of water can create an
acre of fog, and applied it to one of my sub-topics — mindfulness.

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28913873_1655822234w3i1318845029255942146.png)

Content _consumption_ is important. Specifically books, audiobooks, podcasts,
or articles. Those will give you different perspectives on the things you love
talking about.

 **What Creates Engagement?**

Remember: **People don’t remember what you say, they remember how you make
them feel.**

Alan Watts may have been an alcoholic in his later years and cheated on his
wives — which I have my own opinions about — but his work has changed my life
for good. It gives me inspiration, clarity, and a new outlook on life.

I may remember some quotes of his, but the reason I remember them is because
of the clarity they gave me. The _feeling_ of having zero worries in the
world. When I want to experience that again, I throw on an Alan Watts lecture.

YOU are but a humble messenger of a life-changing message.

 **1) The feelings that come from education.**

Learning something new or gaining clarity on some aspect of their life raises
dopamine levels in the brain.

You create clarity through novel perspectives, metaphors, stories, personal
experiences, and other parts of your life that will help others understand
what you are saying.

Your job is to “make sense” to a specific group of people.

You do this by sharing how certain topics make sense to you.

 **2) The feelings that come from inspiration.**

Inspiration is different from motivation.

You are helping people connect the dots on their own, giving them the clarity
to make their own decisions and change their behavior.

People feel good when they think they came up with the answer themselves — but
will still attribute that feeling to you.

 **3) The feeling that comes from entertainment.**

Can you throw in a joke, meme, or interesting point of view?

When you watch a movie, you are entertained through humor, drama, emotional
parts of the story, and battles that spark excitement in you.

 _Entertainment, education, and inspiration are the main goals of your
content._

#  Instagram  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

While I’m not a fan of Instagram as a whole (a lot of closed-mindedness and
arguments that you’ll have to learn to ignore) it is low-hanging fruit.

It can take no longer than 5 minutes to screenshot one of your best tweets of
the day, throw it in Canva, add a background color, and post it to Instagram.

You can do this as you grow on Twitter just to have a consistent and active
page. Some of your Twitter followers will transfer over.

I would recommend posting on either Instagram or LinkedIn when it comes time
to branch out — they can both be “copy-paste” from your Twitter until you are
ready to create a growth strategy (by leveraging other’s audiences).

 **How To Repurpose Your Content For Instagram**

There are a few ways to do this.

I started off by screenshotting tweets from my phone, uploading them to Canva,
and posting them every morning when I wake up.

Another way to do this would be TweetPik.com

That is what I use now to post my best tweets (or a carousel of related
tweets) to Instagram itself.

For graphics and visualizations, I use Figma.com.

There are plenty of tutorials online to learn the basics of Figma fast.

I personally only use black and white shapes, lines, and text to visualize a
big idea from my newsletter.

 **How To Send Traffic With Instagram**

There are a few things to pay attention to when sending traffic with
Instagram:

 **The Captions Of Your Posts**

Your captions can double as LinkedIn posts. You can write them on LinkedIn
first or on Instagram.

I tend to have a mix. If I want to write a longer post for LinkedIn or
Instagram, I will. If not, I’ll keep it short, insightful, and to the point.

You can use the AIDA, PAS, or APAG persuasive writing frameworks for all of
this. Similar to how you would write a thread, but condensed. Instagram
captions do not have to be long, but the longer you hold attention, the more
likely people will be to follow through on your call to action.

At the end of your captions, include a strong and CLEAR call to action about
where to go next.

You should include a call to action in every single caption.

You can send people to:

  * The link in your bio (like a LinkTree, newsletter, or personal site)
  * Your story highlights if they have links (your story highlights can act as a Linktree in itself)
  * Your story (you would post the link to your story after you mention it in the call to action of the caption)

 **Call To Actions At The End Of Videos, Reels, Or Carousels**

Follow a 3 to 1 value to promotion ratio with these posts.

You can have a call to action in every caption, but in the posts themselves, I
would limit it.

This is similar to a podcast, have a strong AIDA or PAS focused call to action
to tell them where to go next in a clear, specific, and straightforward
manner.

I try to view my content as content and like keeping promotions to ONLY be in
the captions.

This simplifies things for me. I don’t promote in the reels and carousels
themselves, but it is an option for sending traffic.

 **Singular Or A Sequence Of Stories With A Link**

I don't have a set method for this. I usually screenshot the text from my
Twitter promotions and add them to my story (then all I have to do is add the
link).

However, you can promote with individual stories or create a sequence of
stories that leads people into your promotion.

To keep things simple, it is OKAY if you just screenshot from Twitter and post
to your stories.

 **The Link In Your Bio**

Your link in bio can be a link to your newsletter, personal site, or LinkTree.

If you have multiple things to promote, I would use a LinkTree. That way when
you tell people to go to the link in bio, there isn't much friction in finding
the right link.

 **Your Story Highlights**

Story highlights are like a LinkTree in themselves. You can house old stories
of yours in the story highlights and tell people to go find the link there.

 **How To Leverage Others' Audiences With Instagram**

I personally do not recommend anything aside from story shares. Why?

I’ve tried the shoutouts that other accounts do, they rarely result in a lot
of followers that actually engage with your posts.

I’ve seen some accounts get to 300K followers by paying a ton of money for
shoutouts, but they end up getting 200-300 likes MAX on their posts. It
doesn’t make sense to waste that money.

Not only are story shares cheaper (because people don’t realize the value in
them yet) you:

  * Allow people to click through and follow you because they like your content.
  * Attract people that actually watch stories, meaning they will watch yours (also meaning that your story promotions will get more viewers).
  * You will have guaranteed active followers in proportion to the quality (and persuasiveness) of your content. This is why learning to write is just as important for Instagram as it is for Twitter.

That is the simplest way I can describe leveraging others’ audiences on
Instagram.

You can use the engagement strategy mentioned previously to build an
Instagram-specific mastermind group. You would swap “retweets” with story
shares in this case.

This shouldn't need a video to explain this. You send the post you want
shared, they share it to only their story without tagging you or saying to
follow you. That's it. As similar to a retweet as you can make it.  

Delete for good?

No, keep it

Yes, delete

#  Optimizing Your Profile  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Remove from my
favorites")

Everything we are talking about is necessary for your _long-term_ success as a
personal brand.

The problem: little of what we wrote down can be displayed on your profile.

However, everything we have wrote down can be used in content, free products,
paid products, and everywhere else that a potential follower will see.

With that, we need to be careful when crafting our profile — we need to
formulate a profile from the strongest points of what you have filled out so
far.

One metric to keep in mind:

 **Does your profile _look_ like it should have 100,000+ followers?**

No?

Educate and iterate.

 **Why Twitter?**

Twitter will be the foundation of all other platform growth and content idea
generation.

  * Twitter has the most powerful share feature of all platforms. It takes one click to expose your content to an entire new audience of people.
  * You can post as many tweets as you'd like to practice and test ideas. If you posted 10 posts to Instagram or LinkedIn, you wouldn't get anywhere.
  * You don't have to show your face, have design skills, or a sexy body. All you need is a brain and the ability to write.
  * You can get feedback on potential article headlines, newsletter topic ideas, and what content ideas perform the best for you (once you know what does well, you can double down on that and use it to grow on other platforms
  * You can post links in tweets, replies, and at the end of threads. It is one of the best platforms for making sales and sending people to deeper content or other platforms. You can practice and test promotional angles this way

The future of Twitter is bright and is a great starting ground for beginners.

Even if you aren't a beginner, it is a no-brainer and zero-time-added way of
testing your content ideas for other platforms. Use Twitter to develop your
ideas, then you can turn that into posts for all other platforms.

Think about it — why does everyone post screenshots of tweets to other
platforms? Because they go viral all the time.

ALL of my content revolves around my Twitter. Even when it isn't my largest
platform.

This entire content ecosystem will make sense in coming sections.

If you are already creating Instagram posts, reels, TikToks, or other pieces
of content — why not write it out first and schedule it to post on Twitter?
Then you can just read the tweet to the camera.

Twitter Is The Foundation

Twitter is a writing and idea platform. The foundation of all good content is
writing and idea generation.

By building your content strategy around Twitter, you set yourself up for
massive leverage on all platforms — while tapping into an underrated and wide-
open platform for new creators that can win the idea game (Twitter)

**Creating An Attention Grabbing Profile Photo**

Your profile is dependent on the vibe you are trying to give off.

I have seen few people pull this off — but you can still grow if your profile
picture is a random picture of selfie.

I know a lot of young business accounts that have blurry profile pictures of
them at the club — because that's the vibe and lifestyle they are trying to
display. Their content matches that.

BUT, for most people, you will want to create a professional profile photo or
a logo that displays the tone you plan to speak in.

A few things to consider:

 **1) How is the lighting?**

Can you see your face clearly?

Are you under harsh lighting that makes you look bad?

 **2) Where are you looking?**

Are you looking away from the camera? (For a more mysterious or insightful
look)

Are you looking at the camera? (For a more direct and confident look)

Are you looking at your content? (Directing people's attention to your
content)

 **3) Do you have good contrast?**

Does your picture stand out on the timeline?

I am not talking about only color here. I am talking about contrast between
creator and consumer images — will people think of you as a followable person?
Or will they see you as someone who is just a bit more active on socials?

 **4) Are you unattractive?**

Don't take this personally, but you know if you are unattractive or not.

It is human nature to trust attractive people more.

If you do not have the best looks, consider being anonymous and paying for a
professional icon or logo to be created on Fiverr or Upwork.

OR — have someone create a vector or animated version of a good picture of
yourself.

We will go over examples of these at the bottom of this section.

If you do go the anonymous route, you have to be extra sure that you are
hitting all 3 pillars of social leverage.

There is an art to running an anonymous account that still builds trust and
brings in sales.

The Only Thing They See

When you are engaging with other people or having your content shared — people
only see your profile picture, your name, and the content along with it.

Does your profile picture _scream_ that you are a creator that provides value?

**Crafting A Bio Based On Where You're At In Your Journey**

When you are an absolute beginner you won't have much authority to bank on.
You can take a few directions in this case:

 **Learn in public** — form your bio based around what you are learning, what
you talk about, and why people should care.

 **Build in public** — form your bio based around a project you are building,
the vision you are building out, and the lessons that come from that.

You don't have to have a shred of experience to start posting online.

You can curate and share content that you've learned. An example from Sahil:

> The top 1% of new ideas I've encountered:
>
> — Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) [May 28,
> 2022](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1530548115891175424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Sahil writes down what he learns and teaches what he learned. It can be that
simple.

If you are experienced and have relevant expertise (expertise that relates to
your Domain Of Mastery) you can:

 **1) Flex your credentials or accomplishments**

Have you helped a certain amount of people?

Have you worked somewhere reputable that people will recognize (I.E. Google?)

What do you have that others want? That's why people follow you — because they
want to do what you've done. They want a higher status in the world. They want
to know what you know.

 **2) Show people what project you are building.**

Are you building something that will help your audience?

Are you working on a project — personal or professional — that others can
benefit hearing the lessons from and learning about?

 **3) Be straightforward with what you talk about and why it matters.**

What _exactly_ do you help people learn and why should they care? What problem
are you solving or benefit are you promising? What's the transformation?

The main thing is accurately describing or implying what the reader will
learn, achieve, or receive with social proof to back that.

 **One thing to keep in mind:**

This goes against much of the advice in the freelancing or consulting space.

They ALWAYS tell you to have the " _I help X do Y without Z_ " bio.

Boring. Everyone does that. And you know what happens if everyone does it...

This will only make you a commodity and limit the amount of people you can
help.

It will also make you feel like you can't talk about your other interests.

Save the selling for somewhere else. Not in your bio.

Emphasize education, bringing people into your deeper content (your
newsletter), and selling from there.

__

Don't Overthink This

How can you creatively put across what you are helping other people achieve or
learn? Why should they care?

**Other Profile Touchpoints To Consider**

There are a few other aspects of social media profiles on any platform that
should be taken into account.

 **1) Your header image.**

Does it match your brand colors?

Are you promoting a product? If not, does the image you are using represent
your vision (does it give off the feeling of what people will experience when
they reach your vision)?

 **2) Your profile link.**

Many people are afraid of putting a link in their profile because it may seem
"salesy" or feel like you are selling something.

Putting a link in your bio shows that you are building something. It gives
people somewhere to go to deepen their trust with you.

If you don't have a link in your bio, you are missing out on building a loyal
following.

People follow others because they give out valuable information.

When in doubt, put a link to your newsletter there.

 **3) Your pinned posts.**

This is available on a few platforms like Twitter and TikTok.

What should you put here?

  * Your highest engagement post to flex social proof (people trust things with high engagement).
  * A thread or post about your hero's journey (your story, the struggles you went through, and what you talk about).
  * A thread or post that has actionable beginner-level advice based on your expertise to raise their level of awareness.

All of those should plug your newsletter so you can funnel readers into there.

 **4) What is showing on your profile timeline.**

You don't want people to go to your profile and see a bunch of retweeted or
shared content. You want to give them a taste about what kind of content you
post.

This stresses the importance of un-retweeting or un-sharing posts every day.

You can also retweet your best tweets after you share someone's posts to keep
yours at the top.

__

Levels Of Awareness

Remember that you are speaking to a low level of awareness when they come
across your profile. They are nowhere near ready to buy from you or even trust
you.

Focus on what they will learn in basic terms.

**Examples Of Great Profiles**

Profile optimization is best illustrated with examples of some great accounts.

This stresses the importance of emulation, imitation, and "stealing like an
artist."

You will get more ideas out of this video than the entirety of what you just
read.

#  Action Steps & My Journey  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my
favorites")

In this module we learned:

  * How to turn your life experiences into your niche with The Experience Model
  * The 3 point content ecosystem you should focus on to build leverage on Twitter
  * The power of lists and how they can be endlessly repurposed
  * How to capture, hold, and convert attention into engagement
  * My persuasive writing framework that I use for most content
  * How to write Twitter threads that pull in followers and drive traffic
  * How to come up with unlimited tweet ideas and develop your top tweets
  * Creating a content flow and testing it over time

In the next module, we will start building a database of intellectual
property. This will help you create novel perspectives, write long-form
content with ease, and start to have genius-level ideas that nobody else on
social media can compete with.

 **Lever Moving Actions**

 **1) Create A Flow For Your Content**

Do you write tweets better when you sit down for a set amount of time? Or just
randomly throughout the day?

What days do you want to outline, write, and edit your newsletter?

Do you want to create threads from your newsletter? Or just write ones that
you know will do well on top of your newsletter?

Start practicing the flow you want to get into, note problems that come up,
and change aspects of your flow here and there.

 **2) Spreading Your Name On Twitter**

It is good to practice writing your newsletter right now — but building an
audience is more of a priority.

You should be:

  * Writing 2-3 tweets a day
  * Engaging with ~10 people you want to connect with or leverage for growth
  * DM 1-3 people a day that you WANT to DM and connect with
  * Writing threads IF you can get eyes on them (or just for practice)

The more you interact with people on Twitter, the more potential you have for
growth (because your name is in more peoples mouths).

 **3) Generating Ideas**

Ideas are the backbone of content.

You must create some form of consumption schedule that you can stick to.

I don’t like sitting down and reading for 30 minutes. I can’t focus. Maybe you
can.

That’s why I enjoy getting outside and walking — because I am forced to listen
to an audiobook or YouTube lecture. MOST of my content is written on these
walks.

 **4) Studying Your Domain Of Mastery**

You have to be good at what you do in order to make money.

Read books, listen to podcasts, and watch YouTube videos on what you want to
become an expert in.

Continue considering and outlining newsletter and lead magnet ideas.

As you write content and get feedback, one of these should click for you —
making you want to go all-in on it.

Don’t worry if you don’t feel this yet. All of this takes time.

 **My Content Journey**

There is one thing that I did differently from most beginners — I did what
worked.

Too many people are trying to tweet whatever they want. That luxury is
reserved for those that built an audience doing what works.

Go back and look at any of your favorite YouTubers, writers, or personal
brands in general.

Did they start by writing whatever they want? Or did they talk about topics
that worked well so they could eventually transition?

Most YouTube vloggers were educational accounts, then they transitioned
because they had a foundation of authority and high-performing content.

#  Growing As A Beginner  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Remove from my
favorites")

When you are just starting out (on any social media platform) you won't have
any eyes on your profile.

This means you need to get creative and understand how you are going to get
eyes on your profile without retweets or shares.

It takes time to network and DM a lot of people, but there are other options
you can take advantage of.

 **How To Engage Properly**

Most people know about this or have caught onto it — but the main way of
getting eyes on your profile without relying on content is through engagement.

That is, engaging with larger accounts in your niche because they already have
traffic (eyeballs) going to the replies.

If your profile picture is good and catches attention, people will be more
likely to read your replies.

Do not just reword what they said or write something that won't get people to
click on your profile.

Instead:

  * Give your perspective on the topic
  * Talk about a problem you solved related to that topic and how
  * Tell a short story that comes to mind when reading that topic
  * ADD to the tweet and format it like you would your own content
  * Ask a question that will get them to respond to you

The more replies you get out, the more potential for growth you have.

This is also a great way to generate content ideas.

If you can't think of content ideas, go engage with 5 people's tweets and tell
me you don't have ideas anymore.

 **A Forbidden Growth Strategy For Those Under 1000 Followers**

This isn't something that people would advise. Many advise against it.  
  
But, this is something I did at the start and I want to give you tools you can
use at YOUR own discretion.  
  
You will also want to ween off of these strategies soon.

I was not going to include this here, but I want to give you multiple
different weapons to attack social media with.

It is your responsibility to use these strategies correctly.

If you want to play it safe — _avoid follow for follow completely._

Also, Twitter and Instagram have a limit on the amount of content you can
like.

If you plan to use the like strategy — start off with no more than 20 per day.
You can test and increase from there, but the higher you go, the more fire you
are playing with.  
  
The video has more nuance and the entire 2-fold strategy.

Please do not give me credit for this strategy lol. Use it at your own risk.

 **Getting Started With Content On The Right Foot**

Virality doesn't matter — but it would be silly to not put as much effort as
you can into increasing the engagement of any given post.

How can you make even the most boring topic high engaging?

We will be diving into more advanced content creation strategies later on, but
I want to give you the strategy that I used for a long time to come up with
high-engaging tweets.

The secret to all of this (especially at the beginning): **DO WHAT WORKS.**

Again, this is why imitation and emulation is important.

 **Where do you find content ideas?**

  * Most popular YouTube videos from creators in your niche
  * Top ranking blog posts found through Google search
  * The featured articles on Medium based on your interests
  * Top tweets from creators in your niche using [Twemex](https://twemex.app) or [TweetHunter](https://thedankoe.com/get/TweetHunter)
  * Pinterest, Instagram, TikTok — I have not figured out how to find the best posts, but if they get high engagement you can take them

 _​​​​​​​I would recommend pulling topics from your Domain Of Mastery to
search on YouTube, Google, or Medium._

 **How do you use these content ideas?**

The content you find will be tried and true (especially the YouTube videos,
they work wonders for idea generation).

YouTube videos, podcasts, and articles can be turned into threads. You can
also turn ideas from those videos into individual tweets.

The main thing you are looking for here is the headline or video title.

Your job is to take that big idea and turn it into content that falls under
your brand.  
  
 **A headline can be turned into:**

  * Short-form content (tweet, insta post, another headline)
  * An idea for your own expansion on that idea (a thought that triggers a thought)

 **The content in a video or article can be turned into:**

  * List style tweets / social posts (if the original content is structured / numbered)
  * Individual tweets from a random "knowledge bomb"
  * Threads that are already structured for you

This is a given, but do not plagiarize — synthesize and curate.

This is what everyone does. We all just steal from each other to give
different perspectives on a specific idea Your customers are determined by
your branding + marketing + getting in front of their face with the right
offer.

There is only so much you can talk about for a specific topic — so why not
talk about the ideas that work?

We all have our own unique biases that will make these unique. This is an art.

 **Leveraging Larger Audiences With Content Curation**

You can get in front of more people by leveraging connections that you make in
the DMs and engaging with larger accounts, but there is another strategy.

There are 2 ways to do this:

1) You can write a thread, tag relevant people that talk about that topic, and
send it to them saying they inspired the post.

2) You can curate a list of tweets, visuals, or posts that have already done
well (by looking at the creators' top tweets). You can then create a thread
out of these, tag all of them, and potentially get retweeted by everyone.

This is difficult to explain in text, so I'll let the video take over from
here.

Delete for good?

No, keep it

Yes, delete

#  Upgrade To Masters  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

Now that you have the knowledge to build an audience around your purpose,
passions, and interests — the next step is monetization.

Whether you know it or not, you have information in your head that can be
packaged up and monetized via a product or service business.

If you're interested in:

  * Watching me build out, market, and launch a product in real time
  * Learning how to monetize from the start with little experience
  * Watching your income increase as your audience grows
  * Implementing my writing, promotions, and sales processes that don't make you look like a used car salesman
  * Reducing the time you spend on client work, lead generation, and marketing as a whole (so you can focus on what you love doing: creating purposeful content)

 _ **You will also get access to:**_

  * Lifetime support in the Discord server (check the "Before We Begin" tab after you upgrade)
  * Access to all future Solopreneur Sprints – 2 weeks of rapid execution with live calls around brand, content, product, and promotions.
  * Expansions to the Notion Command Center and previous call recordings

Then read up on everything else that is included in the Masters curriculum and
upgrade here below.

 _ **Important**_ : Use the discount code **STUDENT** so you don't pay extra.

You have already paid for the Bachelors curriculum. It should cost you $499,
not $999.

Also, you will be granted access with the same login information (if you use
the same email). If you do not receive an email, you can just login to access
the Masters curriculum.

#  The Keys To Success  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

You make new discoveries by figuring things out for yourself.

No matter what information I give you throughout this course, you have to
develop the crucial skill of "figuring it out."

That is how you create the most value. If I can teach it to you, I can teach
it to others.

Your job is to take everything I say here, _understand it through direct
experience_ , and _create_ a way of doing things that is unique to you.

 **Learning By Doing, Imitating, & Emulating**

> The greatest skill one can develop is decreasing the time between idea and
> execution.
>
> — DAN KOE (@thedankoe) [May 5,
> 2022](https://twitter.com/thedankoe/status/1522144576768823296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Life becomes more meaningful when you can connect everyday thoughts,
experiences, information, and stimuli to a project.

In other words, you are nerobiologically rewarded with dopamine and other
chemicals when you apply what you learn.

A personal brand is a giant project that allows you to test, understand, and
practice everything you learn.

Throughout this course, we will be focused on the principles and fundamentals
of any given skill. Your job is to implement _immediately_ by applying that
information to your brand.

  * You learn web design by creating websites and landing pages.
  * You learn to write persuasively by practicing persuasive writing.
  * You learn storytelling by telling stories in your content and products.

Awareness begets awareness.

You cannot become aware of what you need to learn unless you have applied and
understood what you are currently aware of — otherwise it stays in your head
and causes random problems that you are unconscious of.

  * Research the basics, fundamentals, and principles online (Google, YouTube, books, book summary apps — like Shortform or Blinkist)
  * (If necessary) Research the best tool (software, product, etc) to get the job done at your experience level and watch a video on how the basics of that tool
  * Find 3-5 "mentors" to pull inspiration from (whether it be design, tone of voice, writing style, problems they use, benefits they use, anything)
  * Outline a real world project by combining everything you found by researching your mentors — this can be "fake" for practice or straight into your brand
  * Start the project, become aware of what step you are struggling with, and research how to do that specifically via Google or YouTube
  * Complete a first iteration of the project, publish it, see if it gets the results you'd like, and improve it as you learn more about the skill — this is a lifelong process.

An example of this process for **creating a beautiful profile picture or
header image** would be:

  * Research graphic design or headshot photography principles or basics on YouTube — take notes on the _levers_ you can pull with the least amount of effort to get the best results
  * Research a tool to create a profile picture or header image (PhotoShop or Canva) and watch a video on how to navigate it FOR a profile picture or header
  * Find 3-5 people on social media whose designs you like, specifically their profile picture or header image
  * Try to recreate the best parts of their image with your own
  * Watch videos or search for resources to help you navigate roadblocks you encounter (at a basic level, everyone has hit these roadblocks and you CAN find resources online, it may take a bit of digging.

This is the process for learning anything rapidly.

Visualize the end result, outline the project, and research to solve problems
along the way to create your first iteration of a project.

__

Create Momentum

You can only create momentum and inspiration by doing.

Get in the habit of starting projects that you have no idea how to complete
and figure out how to complete it.

Embrace the struggle. That's where the most impactful lessons come from.

**Documenting Your Life**

When you applied what you've learned in a public setting, you are documenting
the phases of your life.

By putting your creations out into the real world, your next creations will be
built on (or iterated from) the previous creation.

Think of your idea generation, content curation and synthesis, life
experiences, and creations that stem from those as documentation.

  * You are documenting your mind and consciousness when you make sense of ideas
  * You are documenting your failures, successes, and solutions to problems in your content
  * You are documenting systems for getting results in certain areas of life with your products
  * You are helping guide and order consciousness others throughout all of this — especially consulting
  * You are documenting and creating systems for yourself "behind the scenes" to produce better work and make more money

All of these things will hold more value than you could ever imagine in 2-3
years.

People remember the ideas that you introduced them to and how it changed their
life (most won't explicitly tell you this until years later).

People will get massive results from your product and praise you for your
work.

Your products, content, brand, and life will improve with each and every
iteration.

These are all incredible — and often unseen — benefits of this line of work.

It is You — but at scale.

Connected to the universe that the coders have created.

__

Write Everything Down

Document and create. That's it. That's your life now.

Write all ideas, thoughts, and steps down as you come across them. We will
have a place to document all of these things in the Notion Command Center that
comes with the Bachelors curriculum.

Delete for good?

No, keep it

Yes, delete

#  Your Domain Of Mastery  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

There is one thing that creators stress over _all the time._

 **Choosing a niche.**

I want you to eradicate the word "niche" from your psyche right now.

Constantly exposing yourself to content telling you to niche down will only
make you live in a stressed-out state.

It is difficult to put **You** in a box, but you can **choose which areas of
interest and expertise to prioritize** at specific points in your journey.

The main thing you should be focusing on is:

  1. Having an interest that makes you money
  2. Having interests that you love talking about and researching
  3. Talking about those skills and interests in a way that attracts like-minded people at different levels of awareness (by talking about related interests.)

Those 3 things will be prioritized based on which phase of your journey you
are in.

Here is my process for creating your niche of one:

 **Your Domain Of Mastery**

Don't think of this from a niche perspective, think of it from a mastery
perspective.

The internet has opened up the opportunity to become an expert in multiple
domains — each one complimenting and providing context to the next.

We are in another renaissance era where polymaths, autodidacts, and artists
can thrive due to the streamlined information and abundance of ideas that are
out in the world.

To start this process off, write down 3 interests:

  *  **One that has the potential to make you money** — like a marketable skill, coaching offer, or anything that you have seen others talking about and making a living off of online.
  *  **One that excites you when it is brought up in conversation** — this hints at passion and obsession which will transfer good energy to your audience.
  *  **One that compliments your other interests or you are curious about** — this will help you create unique, fusion-style perspectives like I do in my newsletter. You will start to realize that everything is connected.

Number 3 is variable and optional. This gives you the opportunity to learn,
teach, and gauge your interest in that subject — meaning you can try different
things and see what sticks.

Every single one of you will be choosing slightly different interests. This
alone is how you differentiate yourself.

Don't focus on niching your brand down — focus on the Domain Of Mastery
instead — then focus on niching your content and products down to solve
specific problems for your audience.

 **Remember** : the perception of your brand (your "niche") is determine by
your content over a 6-12 month span. Don't worry about getting it right just
yet.

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28742619_1655148023dm5Domain_Of_Mastery.png)

Now, this can get overwhelming, especially if you are a beginner that hasn't
established yourself in any specific interest.

See the areas where it labels the priorities?

The completely white circle is where your focus should be when you haven't
established authority in a specific domain.

Once you have established authority, you can work in the second interest, then
the third.​​​​​​​

 _ **The interests you choose should be broad at the start.**_

This gives you ample room to try everything and see what sticks.

That is the key to a lot of this — making a lot of noise and honing in on
signal according to feedback, engagement, and what you enjoy talking about.

__

Your Niche Is Determined By Your Priorities

The topics you talk about (and are known for) are determined by what you are
interested in _right now_ and whether or not you have established authority in
one area.

Know when you need to shift priorities when you are launching a product,
trying to land clients, and trying to maintain the 3 pillars of social
leverage.

Let's use the example of a broad interest — **online business**.

Now, you can break this interest down into:

​​​​​​​ **1) The principles, basics, or fundamentals you need to learn.**

A game isn't fun if you don't understand the rules.

If you don't understand the principles, you don't understand the topic.
Writing these down will give you a foundation for an evergreen newsletter,
video, article, or lead magnet that you can send people to time and time again
when they ask "How do I do X?"

This is how you start building authority in that area and start creating
unique perspectives revolving around those principles.

For online business, the principles are:

  * Create a product or service (physical or digital)
  * Learn marketing and sales to communicate its value
  * Send traffic to your product or service (social media, paid ads, referrals, etc)

That's about it, you can go deeper if you'd like.

Can you see how you can start educating people on this based on your current
perspective and situation? How do those principles apply to the online
business model you are pursuing?

 **2) Topics & sub-topics to expand our awareness of the space.**

Our job is to dive into the iceberg and networks of topics that our interest
presents. This is how we create depth and deepen our understanding of the
topic fast.

Attacking your interest from all angles is how you create depth and authority.

All of these can turn into multiple short-form content ideas and a series of
long-form content ideas.

  * Self-employment
    * ​​​​​​​Productivity
    * Focused work
    * Creating your niche
  * Client acquisition
    * ​​​​​​​How to DM
    * Qualifying
    * Service onboarding
  * Social media growth
    * ​​​​​​​Writing newsletters
    * Writing threads
    * The best types of content
  * ​​​​​​​Digital product creation
    * ​​​​​​​Marketing and offers
    * Launch strategy
    * Best platforms to build on

Can you see how certain sub-topics start to branch into domains outside of
online business? If you break things down enough, everything starts to
connect. This is why I keep saying it doesn't _really_ matter what you talk
about — because people will know what your expertise is based on other
content.

You can break these down all day and start to connect the dots.

ALL of these have problems that you can target and solve for yourself and
others.

 **3) Mentors to emulate from those topics.**

If you want validated content ideas and a business worth studying — follow the
people that have put in the time and effort to refine their ideas (and have
results to show for it).

I personally use [TweetHunter](https://thedankoe.com/get/tweethunter) and
[Twemex](https://twemex.app/) to write, schedule, and generate content ideas
from writers that I aspire to be like.

This is also a part of interest immersion. By following everyone that talks
about this subject, purchasing top-rated books on the subject, and exposing
yourself to information left and right — you become a member of that "niche."
Meaning that you have market research at your fingertips for when that time
comes.

 **4) Content ideas that are validated and will nearly guarantee engagement.**

From your topic breakdown and researching your mentors, you should have ample
ideas flooding your mind.

We will discuss viral content idea generation in a few sections when we
discuss growing as a beginner.

 **5) Real-world problems so you can create compelling content and product
angles.**

Now that you are immersed in that environment, you will be able to identify
others problems and your own problems.

You can create content around these to build authority or just note it down in
your command center to use as marketing firepower later on.

We have not talked about content creation yet, so don't get to ahead of
yourself here. However, ALL of these are content ideas. Everything you right
down here is for the sake of creating content that hits all 3 pillars of
social leverage.

Right now I want you to consider your interests and which one you will
establish authority in first.

 **How To Establish Authority Quick**

Again, authority comes from **depth** or **social proof**.

Most beginners don't have social proof to leverage, so you must double down on
depth.

Throughout this course, our focus will be on creating the most depth
imaginable — and social proof of course — but you don't want to rely on one or
the other. Leveraging both will bring you the most followers, clients, and
sales.

How do you create depth? By talking about all aspects of that interest and
educating people on what they need to know.

Whenever you plan to launch a product, run a promotion, pivot your brand, or
just start talking about a new interest, here's what you do:

  *  **Outline a lead magnet (free download in exchange for their email) that educates them to the point of understanding that topic** — this is usually beginner level and primes people to buy your product or service (this is how you _create_ your own customers... not just expect them to buy your products)
  *  **Dissect certain aspects of the topic in your newsletter** — you can either fill in the outline of your lead magnet by writing chapters of it as a newsletter, or just come up with content ideas and write about it.
  *  **Make it the 80/20 of your social media content** — 80% building authority and educating people from beginner to advanced on the topic at hand, 20% talking about your other interests.

The more you educate people on a specific topic, the more they will trust you
as the expert on the subject and pay you for your products or services.

 **Action Steps You Can Take Right Now**

1) Solidify the interest that you want to establish authority in. (You can
always change this, just commit to one for now)

2) Immerse yourself in that environment and study products and lead magnets
that are in that space.

3) Outline a free eBook, loom video, checklist, or other form of lead magnet
and focus on educating people that are at a beginner level.

4) Use the lead magnet outline to create newsletter content ideas — write
newsletters at your own pace (this will be easier when we discuss content
creation)

5) Use that newsletter as inspiration for content ideas and plug your
newsletter issues under it to gain email subscribers

6) Eventually, start promoting your lead magnet under social posts and in your
emails to lead people into purchasing your products or services.

This process will make more sense later in this course — but I wanted to plant
that seed of awareness in your head ;)

I've created 10+ lead magnets in my time here. This has always been a first
step to educating people on what I want to talk about so they are interested
in it.

This shouldn't be seen as overwhelming because the lead magnet forms the
foundation for your content. It is not a balancing act of both. It is about
putting effort into creating a high-quality lead magnet and creating content
_around_ that. 2 in 1.

 **The Mastery Method**

The Mastery Method will help you understand the domain you want to master. It
will also provide clarity on which interests you should prioritize first.

I would not give any less time than 1 month to pursue one specific interest.

Once you have an interest you want to pursue, again:

  * Outline a project (or lead magnet) related to that interest so you can learn with context.
  * Immerse yourself in environment of social accounts, books, blogs, podcasts, and the rest so you are inspired and content creation comes easy.
  * Evaluate and reflect on that specific interest and see if you want to keep that in your brand.

I was adamant on including health in my brand for the longest time. I recently
got rid of it because it wasn't helping. If I want to start talking about it
again, I can... I just have to attack that interest from all angles and
educate people on topics I want to talk about.

 **Bonus: Name Your Domain & Broaden Your Interests**

If you want to ease your worries about not being "niche" enough, here's what
you can do.

After helping people with this “Domain Of Mastery” concept before, the most
common questions are:

 _“What interests should I choose?”_

 _“What if my interests are too niche?”_

 _“What if people aren’t interested in them?”_

If you are interested in something, other people are. You aren’t that special
;)

For the other questions, these are refined with time.

If you feel like your interest is too niche or specific, broaden it a bit.
Move up a market stage (niche market, sub market, eternal market).

Instead of “email marketing” being your interest, make it “online business,”
“freelancing,” or “marketing.”

Why? We are aiming for building a large audience here, and you don’t want to
put yourself in a box too soon. You can still primarily talk about email
marketing, but you will get more readers and engagement when using email
marketing TO explain marketing concepts.

If you are interested in bodybuilding, broaden it to health or fitness.

If you are interested in meditation, broaden it to spirituality or mindset.

You want to give yourself ample room in terms of writing and audience growth.

Once you have your 3 interests that you plan to master, you can write about
anything related to those interests.

Naming Your Domain

If you want to eliminate even more competition, you can brainstorm a new name
for your domain as a whole.

As an example, if your interests are now broad and seemingly unrelated, like:

  * Marketing
  * Spirituality
  * Bodybuilding

One, I would argue that these all fall under self-improvement. But that is
boring and doesn't get the point across.

Can you create a new "niche" that others can identify with?

 _Bodybuilding + spirituality = Physical Spiritualist_

 _Bodybuilding + marketing = Financial Fitness_

 _Marketing + spirituality = Wealthy Monk or Zen Creation_

You don't have to include all 3, but you can.

This is optional. I would recommend sitting with it and coming up with one
that resonates with your soul. If it's the right name, you will know. If you
don't know, sit on it longer.

Brainstorm some of your own, contemplate it on a walk outside, and see what
your mind comes up with.

I've seen some great names for specific categories or Domains Of Mastery in
the past.

Mine could be summed up as **one-person businesses** and **lifestyle design**.

One-person businesses = marketing, coaching, and every other business interest
I want to talk about (without lacking niche-ness and specificity).

Lifestyle design = spirituality, mindset, self-improvement, and every other
aspect of life really.

I am not subscribed to any specific niche, but I am. Everything is connected
;)

#  Lifestyle Design  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

Here is the 80/20 of lifestyle design:

  * Set a desired lifestyle (vision)
  * Notice the gaps (time, money, resources)
  * Work to close those gaps (building leverage)
  * Prioritize and execute on what you can right now (don’t _think_ about the future)

Just like creating a vision, this is something you work towards over time.

We don’t _really_ know what we want. I don’t think we ever will, but we have
to have a direction to work in to figure out if we actually wanted it.

So, start to think of the lifestyle aspect of your vision.

  * When do you want to work?
  * How long do you want to work?
  * What do you enjoy working on the most?
  * What do you hate working on that you can delegate?
  * What kind of content do you like writing? How can you write more of it?
  * Again, you can create an anti-vision for more clarity here, what are the opposites of these questions?

If you don’t get specific with this, you won’t be able to act accordingly.

How can you know if working 2 hours a day is possible or impossible if you
haven’t done it (or at least done everything in your power to make it
reality?)

 **Hint: it’s possible. Don’t let anyone (speaking from the perspective of
completely different goals than you) tell you otherwise.**

 **When You Don't Have Much Time On Your Hands**

At the start, I could only work with the time that my 9-5 allowed.

I had a solid 2-3 hours every day to move the right levers toward achieving my
goals.

(I know some people have even less time than that. I was working on my
business from my phone a lot of the time while at my job).

My levers in this case were:

  * Posting 3 tweets a day
  * Having my network share the tweets
  * Make sure I am growing at a steady, reasonable rate
  * Plug my newsletter, lead magnet, or offers accordingly
  * Writing my eBook to get the first iteration out and improve from there

Yours may be completely different.

I knew that once I hit a specific follower amount, my income should match.

I was committed from the start. There was no “failure.” If my eBook launch
failed (which a few have)… oh well. The world isn’t going to end. I knew there
was a way to make it profitable.

Up until about 50K followers, my income kept pace. $0.50 - $1 per follower per
month depending on the month.

Keep in mind, I had all of the knowledge in this course at this time. I knew
how to monetize and I knew how to position my skillset to a beginner-level
audience based on what is already working.

From there, I would also plug my services and DM people that came across my
account to pitch my web design / funnel services.

 **My point with all of this:**

You have goals that are completely different from mine.

Those goals demand that you have different priorities and tasks from mine.

If threads are getting you better results than a newsletter, set the
newsletter aside and prioritize where your energy should be going.

If you only have an hour a day to work on all of this — where should the
majority of your energy and attention be going?

Probably towards monetization and audience building.

If you have 2-4 hours a day and already have an offer to monetize and growing
audience, you can start to prioritize your newsletter, threads, and cross-
platform content in a streamlined way.

 **Testing A Content Flow**

When I quit the job to go full-time on my business, I had to develop new
habits, routines, and systems around NEW levers since I had more time on my
hands.

As mentioned previously in this course, all of this is unpredictable. Jobs
give you set hours to work, set hours to rest, set deadlines to hit, set
priorities to work on — these are all things you will have to test and figure
out for yourself according to your goals.

When I had more time, I knew that I could design my workday in a way that
suited me best.

Once you find your flow (after a few weeks of testing) you will be able to
write much more than you thought you could.

#  Action Steps  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

I have taught you everything you need to know.

If you wanted to, you could take all of this information and see immense
success in life.

Next up is the [Bachelors curriculum ](https://digitaleconomics.school)which
takes a different approach than Digital Economics 101.

Digital Economics 101 went very heavy on information.

In the Bachelors (and Masters) curriculum, we will be very heavy on action and
implementation.

I will give you the systems that allow you to fail fast and make success **for
yourself.**

You can only rely on my teachings for so long before they become your
teachings (to yourself).

So, let's end Digital Economics 101 with some actionable steps — **so you can
hit a wall and improve.**

 **The 80/20 Of Branding, Audience Building, & Content Creation**

Your brand and content are a composition of:

  *  **YOUR vision for your future** — this is your brand mission, what are you leading your followers towards?
  *  **2-3 broad topics that you love reading and talking about** — you will consume information relating to these for idea generation and mention them in your bio to show what you talk about. _These broad topics become niche topics when you break them down into sub-categories and target a specific problem within that category._
  *  **Your expertise** — what skills do you have (or skills that you are learning) and how are they helping you actualize your vision for the future? How do they resolve the pains of others and help them reach that vision?
  * Again, remember levels of awareness, persuasion, the eternal markets, and the evergreen markets. How can you craft a brand message and content relating to all of those?

 _You are starting a project here._

Make it a habit to get inspiration from those you aspire to be like.

How is there bio worded? What awareness level is it targeting? What does their
content look like? Why does it make people engage?

 **Be hyper-conscious** of yourself when looking at accounts you look to
emulate.

At the very beginning, you do not have a following. Your account will not grow
from content alone. You need to deconstruct the platform and understand what
makes people GROW.

 _Here are the levers you should be moving regarding building an audience:_

  *  **Engaging with big accounts** — respond to accounts with a large following 10-20 times per day with _your personal experience relating to the topic they posted about._ **Do not** reply by rewording what they said. Remember — pains, benefits, and transformations for a specific awareness level — that is what will make people follow you.
  *  **Networking with people you want to work with** — send 3-5 DMs per day complimenting someone you want to work with on a recent post of theirs. Follow up with them in a few days with content that you wrote using theirs as inspiration. DM it to them and tell them that they inspired what you wrote (many times they will engage with it, boosting the amount of impressions it gets).
  *  **Writing beginner-level educational content** — we need a balance of growth and authority. Target a very beginner level (and low level of awareness) problem and educated people on how to overcome it. List style posts (bullet point steps) work the best in this scenario. Then turn each of the bullet points into their own post.
  *  **Leveraging traffic through curation** — write a thread or a post and mention large accounts in it (they may engage with it). If you write a thread about fitness and go over a talking point that a large account talks about, recommend people to follow that account.
  *  **Immerse yourself in a conducive growth environment** — for the next 30 days, follow the people you aspire to be like and comment on their posts. Watch YouTube videos and only expose yourself to an echo chamber of content that you would want to create. Listen to audiobooks and podcasts on the topics you want to talk about. Read 1 book this month on something that you _may_ want to be known for. This alone will fill your mind with ideas on how to grow and write.

These are only a few strategies out of many.

My question for you — how can you get more EYES on your profile? Where are the
people that you want to follow you hang out and how can you make yourself well
known in that space?

Consistency and repetition is key here.

 **The Highest Leverage Play**

The ABSOLUTE most important thing to building an audience is connections.

Let me paint you a picture.

I met Joey Justice when we each had ~500 followers.

Now we are far ahead of that. We built cohorts together. We did podcasts that
changed people's lives. We've met each other in person multiple times.

(Hell, I LIVE with Dakota Robertson right now. We met each other after he paid
me $8000 for consulting.)

We brought together people we had DMd previously into a group chat called the
"Dream Team."

We helped each other out, shared strategies, got on calls, shared each others
posts, and helped each other with out expertise in exchange for testimonials.

Almost _everyone_ in that group is one of my good friends. We all have
audiences of 50K to 200K.

I bet you know all of them and look up to them.

We all started from zero around 2 years ago.

We were "nobodies" 2 years ago.

Even after 6 months we had created such massive leverage for ourselves that we
knew we would never have to work a day in our life again. We had created
freedom through the internet.

The contents in this course contain everything we did to get to where we are
now, nothing held back.

The testimonials we gave each other have increased in perceived value and help
us make more sales (because they are a well known name! The testimonials alone
that I worked for back then have easily made me over 6 figures by themselves.

Getting on calls with other people and helping them without expecting a thing
in return is the highest ROI thing you can do in this space.

  * DM anyone that catches your eye
  * Compliment them on their work
  * Ask them what their goals are and what they are working on
  * Treat it as a normal conversation, like you were meeting someone at a party or texting a good friend — don't be robotic or needy — play it cool
  * Share strategies you have learned and ask if they want to help each other grow
  * Engage with accounts with insightful and introspective replies
  * Make yourself known by getting your ideas out there
  * Let everyone know what you do so they can pass your name along
  * Offer whatever value you can to everybody you cross

If you can do that, you will win. You have my promise.

(IF — and only if — you have all other areas of Digital Economics 101 locked
down. People won't follow consumer-looking accounts or those that don't put
out value).

It's time to start taking your work — and yourself — seriously.

 **If You Haven't Already...**

If you are enrolled for the next [Bachelors
curriculum](https://digitaleconomics.school), here are a few things you need
to complete before we start.

 **1) Create A Twitter & Beehiiv Account**

If you already have a Twitter account and an email marketing software (for
long form posts that ALL of our content will stem from — and builds a deeper
connection that Twitter) then disregard this part. If not:

Create a Twitter account or use your current one — do not start over from
scratch, you need all of the initial followers (social proof) you can get.
Clean up your profile picture, bio, and who you are following.

Create a [Beehiiv](https://www.beehiiv.com/) account and walk through all of
the settings — Do not worry about subscriber count or anything really. Just
set it up and make sure you are ready to create your first long-form article.

Why Beehiiv? It allows you to link people to previous newsletters you have
created. **This is crucial for the content ecosystem we will build out in the[
Bachelors Curriculum](https://digitaleconomics.school).**

Down the road, you can transfer your emails to another platform, build a
personal site for yourself, and upload previous newsletters to the blog.

If you are on a different social media platform, still, start a Twitter
account. That is such low hanging fruit. You don't need visuals. You just need
to write. You can transfer any short-form content you've already written over
to it.

 **2) Make Your First Post**

Write your first Tweet while keeping everything we've talked about in Digital
Economics in mind.

Pay attention to how other people post. Start making connections on why it
does well. Use it as inspiration for your own posts. Keep it problem and
benefit focused.

Get in the habit of posting once a day minimum.

If you have to stay up until 2am trying to think of a post, do it. I did that
many times. If I didn't have a post ready for the next day (and didn't get one
written) I considered myself a failure. I _could not_ lose any momentum.

 **3) DM One Person You Want To Connect With**

This is more about overcoming the fear of people being "so far ahead of you."

Remember, likability.

If you can compliment someone on their work, be interested in _them,_ and
offer the value you can (even if its just a resource you came across relating
to what they are working on) — they will like you.

Start small.

 **4) Start Adding Any Idea That Comes To Your Mind To A Notes Page On Your
Phone**

When you immerse yourself in a conducive and aligned environment, you will
have a hard time NOT having ideas.

Get in the habit of writing potential content ideas into your phone so they
don't get lost.

Last but not least, if you are already enrolled in the [Bachelors
curriculum](https://digitaleconomics.school), be prepared to change the
direction of your life for good :)

#  Self-Management  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

When you begin building out personal projects:

  * You do not have a boss
  * You do not have set tasks
  * You do not have a hierarchy of goals to execute on
  * You do not have a marketing, sales, or content department

It's all on you.

This means you will need to _create_ structure for your days that breeds
clarity and focus.

There are more parts to this, but I have baked the vision, goals, mission, and
value creation processes into your brand (this is a PERSONAL brand by the
way).

For now, I want to show you how to structure your days for _getting the most
done in as little time as possible._

#  Action Steps  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

In this module we learned:

  * How to imitate others and what ideas to note down (so you can make them your own)
  * What software and process to use for capturing ideas from different mediums
  * How to use The Epistemic Method to create new knowledge and ways of understanding
  * How to start building your Digital Reality to separate yourself from your competition
  * How to use your database of ideas to create fusion content and bring unique perspectives to the table
  * A brief overview of lifestyle design and how to become more aware of your problems

All in all, this is a holistic approach to understanding and monetizing your
life.

 **Lever Moving Actions**

Again, with all of this, don't bite off more than you can chew.

It is better to be aware of these things and eventually work to incorporate
them in your process than it is to try incorporating them and end up not
getting anything done.

 **1) Continue Growing & Studying**

Are you writing 1-3 tweets a day?

Are you engaging with others to get eyes on your account?

Are you connecting with people and creating mastermind groups?

Are you actively consuming information in alignment with your interests?

No? Stop what you are doing and focus on those. Nothing else matters until
those are habit.

 **2) Start Developing Your Ideas**

Take your ideas from The Queue and run experiments, make discoveries,
formulate processes, and eventually create theories or concepts.

This is what will bring a unique view to your newsletters, products, lead
magnets, and anything else you plan to create.

This is how you go from commodity to irreplaceability.

 **3) Start Testing and Streamlining Your Content Flow**

You aren't going to decrease your work times if you aren't intentional about
it.

When you test new ways of doing things, you uncover problems faster — meaning
you can learn about them and solve them faster (and teach your audience how
you did it!)

Delete for good?

No, keep it

#  Iterating Your Content Flow  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my
favorites")

All of this is what has worked for me.

It may not work for you.

We do not live the same life or have the same amount of time on our hands.

You need to test and iterate on your own style of flow and schedule.

Your ideas and tweets will evolve with time as well.

#  Non-Needy Networking  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Remove from my
favorites")

Most people suck at DMs.

Seriously. It's a problem.

Never, and I repeat never ever ever expect a response if all you send is:

  * Hi or hey
  * How are you
  * Can you follow me back
  * A straight sales pitch with no prior connection
  * A long block of text that takes too much time to read (especially if the sentences aren't spaced out)

You have to approach DMs tactically. Especially if you are reaching out to a
big account that gets 10+ DMs an hour and probably doesn't check them (they
usually skim over them to see if there is anything important).

Again, put yourself in the other person's shoes and think for a second. How
can you stand out from the sea of crappy DMs that don't provide a shred of
value before asking for something in return?

 **7 Steps To Non-Needy Networking**

Knowing how to communicate and DM another person that you want to connect with
will open up opportunities to paid work, social leverage, and meeting high-
level people. You can use this strategy to:

  * Get a 50,000+ follower account to retweet your thread that will result in massive growth (the same goes for any other social platform sharing your post)
  * Have connections that will share new growth strategies with you (Dickie Bush just sent me a LinkedIn tip the other day out of nowhere, I feel compelled to return the favor now)
  * Join or create mastermind groups and begin forming your tribe (that you will grow with for much of your social media journey)
  * To put your name in more peoples mouths. The more people that know about you, the more work and potential connections will be sent your way. **Get your name in front of as many eyes as possible.**

Here are the 7 steps of Non-Needy Networking:

 **1) Find somebody that you WANT to DM**

This is not exclusive to making connections. It is crucial for paid work as
well.

The common theme between service businesses is that their life is a living
hell if they do not resonate with the client they are working with.

Reach out to people that:

  * You are inspired by
  * You would want to work with
  * You would want to strategize with
  * You see potential for mutual benefit

When you are just starting out, you will have to work your way up the ladder.
Start by DMing people that are within your follower range (or your cohort
classmates!)

Once you have an audience and leverage, you can really reach out to anybody
and get a warm response.

 _Where can you find people to DM?_

  * The "following" list of accounts that you like
  * In the reply area of one of your mentors (if people are replying, it is implied that they are trying to grow and network)

Those are the main two areas to find people without using any fancy
prospecting tools.

 **2) Send them an inspired compliment**

Find a piece of their content, work, or current projects that you are truly
inspired by. Send it to them and tell them how it resonated with you.

This requires you to actually like their work

People love praise — and per the principle of reciprocity — will feel
obligated to repay this soft favor.

An example for a tweet on managing emotions:

> What's up Dan, this tweet hit me hard. I've been going through it the past
> couple of days and this instantly gave me some relief. Thank you. [add the
> link to the post]

  

Simple as that.

 **3) Show interest in them**

If they don't respond, you can try reaching out again in the same manner.

Showing interest is communication 101 — showing interest makes you
interesting.

Ask them about:

  * Their goals
  * What they are building
  * What they do for work

This gives you the opportunity to give value (even if YOU don't have value to
give right now).

Let's assume they respond with the generic "thank you so much."

Now, you can either find what they are working on from their profile or just
ask them.

 **If you find what they are working on:**

> What are your next plans with Modern Mastery? It's been crazy seeing it
> grow, I'm curious what you've got in store.

  

 **If you can't find what they are working on:**

> Do you have anything that you're building right now? With that kind of
> content you must have something bigger in the works.

  

 **4) Lead with value**

This is the part that trips most people up.

Your first options are to:

  * See where you can help 
  * Send actionable tips
  * Send resources, systems, or videos you've created or remember off the top of your head

 _Don't go straight for a transaction when you haven't given anything first._

If you have to ask more questions in order to send better actionable tips or
resources, do it.

By resources I mean YouTube videos, articles, or anything that may be able to
help them — or would pique their interest.

If you have no value to give you can:

  * Send a resource that can help them with their goals
  * Connect them with someone else in your network
  * Just continue having a good conversation and showing interest

Show that you are interested in helping them.

 **5) Get on a call to make a deeper connection**

This part is optional but recommended. You can skip straight to step 7 after a
few days, but I would practice all of these steps at some point.

Making that "face-to-face" interaction is priceless. Nobody can see you, your
personality, or your mannerisms via text.

When I was starting out, I was getting on zoom calls left and right with
people that I wanted to get to know better. It's more normal than you think —
and people are usually open to it when it is clear that you are just there to
get to know them.

You can also take the conversation to somewhere like Telegram and send voice
messages to make yourself seem more human. Most social accounts use Telegram
and Whatsapp groups to communicate and strategize.

 **6) Follow up with value**

Remember their goals and keep an eye out for any content, resources, or people
you can send their way. When you find something or someone, send it to them.

> I remember you telling me about your plans for [their project or goal]. I
> found this today and thought you'd find it helpful.

  

"This" can be a YouTube video, article, lead magnet you found, or a person you
connected with that may be able to help them.

 **7) Follow up with an ask**

By this point you've built a pretty damn solid connection. You've given value
to the point where they are ready to return the favor. From here you can:

Ask them to join a mastermind group

Send them one of your posts that you put a lot of time into

Ask any specific questions you have for them without paying for consulting

If your plan is to leverage their audience for growth, be sure to write a post
that they would want to share. Then, you can send it to them and mentioned
that they inspired that post.

> Yo, just wrote this up and thought you'd enjoy it. It was inspired by our
> previous conversation.

  

Do not ask them to retweet it. Let them engage with it however they see fit.

Even if you don't get a retweet or share, any engagement will help more people
see it — helping you grow.

You should be reaching out to people almost every day. If you are immersing
yourself in the environment of your interests, you should see inspirational
people that you want to reach out to on a daily basis.

 **If you want to increase the chances of larger accounts responding to your
DMs — follow them and engage with their content for a few days before reaching
out so they are familiar with your face and profile picture.**

__

One More Reminder

DMs. Are. Important.

You may not see the value in it now — but I promise you will grow 10x faster
than the next person if you prioritize connections (especially as a beginner).

They don't say "your network is your net worth" for nothing.

**Forming A Mastermind**

Social media is tribal.

We tend to associate one person with another group of people whether we
realize it or not.

You can build your own tribe of people by connecting with them first using
Non-Needy Networking and then asking if they want to join a mastermind group
to help each other grow.

For a mastermind group, you will mainly be reaching out to people that have a
similar follower account as you. The lower followers you have, the more picky
people will be about joining a group with you.

Whether you are for or against the idea of engagement groups - they are an
extremely good way of:

  * Leveraging others' network of followers to get eyes on your content and profile
  * Making lifelong connections (I am still friends with those in my first mastermind group)
  * Strategizing with those at a similar level as you, sharing new tactics you are learning
  * Staying active on the timeline and building your tribe (people will start to associate you with those people, and it will build a stronger connection with your audience)

The general problem with mastermind groups is that they aren't structured.
People send posts at every second of the day... some don't send, and the group
ends up dying out.

This is the strategy that I used from 5K to 50K ish followers. It's simple and
doesn't require you to share a ton of posts and destroy your feed.

At the end of the day, how you use these mastermind groups are up to you. You
can use them to:

  * Create a group where you comment on everyone's posts to boost engagement
  * Create a group where you retweet each other (or share depending on the platform) to get more eyes on each others accounts
  * Create a group where you share strategies that are working for you

None of this is mandatory if you are already engaging with people, networking
in the DMs, and getting eyes on your content and profile.

Below I've embedded a video explaining exactly how to structure the group
[using this excel
sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14jS8OPJSLYFPWFHYRm7VCMxmNo9M2Is2-nCeSzpqsMM/edit?usp=sharing)
(click "File > Make a copy" and then you can edit).

Now if you don't want to form this kind of mastermind group, **you can always
reach out to connections you've built individually.**

If you create a post that you want shared, you can always send it to one of
your close connections, ask them to share it or engage with it, and tell them
to send you something to share in return to share or engage with.

#  Awareness & Attention  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

Remember this: humans are emotional, not logical beings.

We are constantly looking to resolve our conscious pains, become aware of our
unconscious pains, and implement solutions that benefit our quality of life.

There is 1 concept that will save you a lot of pain on your creator journey:

 **The Levels Of Awareness**

  1.  **Unaware:** unaware of the problem
  2.  **Problem Aware:** aware that they have a problem but not sure what is causing it or how to solve it
  3.  **Solution Aware:** aware that a solution exists, but are unaware of your solution (free or paid resources)
  4.  **Product Aware:** aware of your free or paid solution, but either haven't implemented it or are hesitant on purchasing
  5.  **Most Aware:** aware of your solution and are ready to act on it — all they need is a little push (with persuasion and influence)

Your top-of-funnel content (social media platforms) should target all of the
above, with levels 1-3 as the priority.

Your bottom-of-funnel content (emails, lead magnets, and products) should also
target all of the above, with levels 3-5 as the priority.

 **Attention Is The New Currency**

The first step towards any transaction of value is capturing attention.

Some transactions include:

  * Free content in exchange for engagement and shares
  * Free products in exchange for their email
  * Deeper, more valuable content in exchange for a click
  * Going from a DM to a call
  * Going from a call to a sale

Almost every touchpoint of your brand, content, and products involve a
transaction of some form.

Your ability to create that transaction is based on capturing, holding, and
converting attention.

The tried and true ways of capturing attention include:

  * Calling out who you are talking to (like what someone does for work)
  * Targeting a pain point that someone is experiencing
  * Opening a curiosity loop (by asking a question or implying a puzzle with a missing piece)
  * Using statistics, numbers, and other pattern interrupts that pull readers out of their mindless scrolling

This is why content writers always stress nailing the hook or headline of a
post.

If somebody doesn't read the hook or headline and feel compelled to dive
deeper based on their level of awareness — they aren't going to read the rest
of your content (or go through the rest of your course).

There are more tips and tricks for capturing attention, but those are
dependent on _what_ you are trying to capture attention with.

  *  **Short-form content** (like tweets and IG posts) doesn't allow much space for depth — so we need to be tactical with how we write
  *  **Medium-form content** (like LinkedIn posts, carousels, and threads) can have a proper hook, body, and conclusion rapidly — it's "easier" to keep the reader engaged with how they are structured.
  *  **Long-form content** (like emails and articles) allow for a lot of creativity, storytelling, and general value — so we need to understand that.

All of these will be touched on, systemized, and streamlined with an All-In-
One content template.

 **My question for you:**

Are you conscious of who you are talking to at every touchpoint in your brand?

Your social media bio? Your pinned tweet? Highlighted posts? Lead magnet opt
in page? Email list opt in? Landing page writing? Podcasts, videos, articles?
Specific tweets? Post-buyer emails? When someone DMs you? When you DM someone
else?

What part of the journey are your readers on and what journey are you going to
take them on when you capture their attention?

How can you craft a message that is _specific_ to them and where they are at?

__

Do Further Research

This is a well-talked about subject. You can find many different resources on
persuasive communication, capturing attention, and how the mind interprets
what it reads.

Explore your curiosity and write about what you learn :)

**Foundational Tips For Holding Attention**

When it comes to holding attention, you must understand the principles of
storytelling and persuasion (they are the same thing) — which we will discuss
in the next module on communication.

When you are creating online, throw everything you know about communication
out the window.

This isn't high school English class.

If you write like your English teacher wanted you to — you will suffer. I
promise. It's not fun.

You are writing to build a connection. Similar to how you would in real life,
but a bit more tactical.

The very first step for impactful communication, specifically writing (as we
will be starting with writing), **is readability.**

Have you seen how Twitter accounts, some articles, and sales pages are spaced
out?

The creators are mindful of guiding the readers attention.

Here are some quickly implementable tips for holding attention before we dive
deeper:

  * Space out your sentences (press "enter" after 1-3 sentences). This can be longer in blog posts
  * Be mindful of how your content looks — does it guide the reader down the page? Does it have rhythm and intention behind how it is written?
  * Keep sentences as short and impactful as you can — edit filler words that detract from the message
  * If you can't keep them short, use dashes "—" and parenthesis so their attention doesn't get tired, keep people guessing (you can see how I do this throughout my writing).
  * Use bullet points, lists, and other methods that imply that _something comes next_

Humans are always trying to piece together the puzzle.

They want to know what came before and after a certain point in a story (the
situation that you are referring to in your content).

Keep all of this in mind as you are reading content.

 _ **How are these creators guiding your attention towards a mutually
beneficial transaction?**_

Start practicing this immediately. The sooner you start practicing, the more
you will become aware of how your attention is being controlled.

__

Intention

Do not overthink this, but be mindful of what kind of person you are targeting
with your content.

What are they going through? What did you go through at that timeframe? How
did you overcome it? How can you deliver that message in a way that delivers
full impact?

Delete for good?

No, keep it

Yes, delete

#  The Evergreen Content Style  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my
favorites")

People. Love. Lists.

Lists lists lists.

They just work every single time. Especially for those just starting out.

Lists have to be the one style of content that will never go out of style. You
find them everywhere.

If you can’t think of something to post — a list will do the trick (and can be
created from almost any word or idea you can think of.

Example:

A random word that I’m thinking of right now — “Responsibility”

(This can be as simple as writing a word related to your interest, or you
could pull inspiration from the Viral Idea Generation section)

Now brainstorm some sentences that come to mind (by asking what, how, and
why):

  * Responsibility is the difference between a victim mindset and growth mindset. (What)
  * How do you cultivate responsibility? (How)
  * Personal responsibility is an important trait. (Why)

We could turn all of these into their own list tweet, but lets combine them
all in one:

> The difference between a victim and growth mindset is responsibility.
>
> You cultivate it by:
>
> \- Putting in effort
>
> \- Accepting blame
>
> \- Responding not reacting
>
> \- Not taking things personally
>
> \- Knowing that you control your fate
>
> Given time, personal responsibility will give you a sense of control and
> abundance in your life.

  

This could be better, but that took a minute or two. We can come back and edit
this whenever we want to make it more concise.

If you haven’t noticed this yet, I intentionally designed the tweet in a way
that catches readers’ attention, leads them down the page, and leaves them no
option but to engage.

We’ve worked in a few things into one tweet — a transformation, comparison,
how-to, and opportunities to turn every one of those bullet points into their
own tweet or list.

Lists are an all-around incredible way to start diving deeper into your
specific interests, finding what to learn next, and developing your skill in
that area through writing & execution.

 **Repurposing Your List**

Now that we have a list, we can repurpose it into any length of content
imaginable.

If you post it first, you can gauge if the engagement is good or not to see if
you want to repurpose it into more content.

 **1) Add it as a section of your newsletter.**

You can craft a story around the topic of responsibility and end your
newsletter with the list we created earlier.

Let’s say we follow a general copywriting framework — AIDA

A = attention

I = interest

D = desire

A = action

The newsletter subject line should catch **attention** (you can research
Medium or YouTube titles about “responsibility” to brainstorm a subject line).

For **interest** , we can tell a short story about a time in our lives where
taking responsibility led to a beneficial outcome.

For **desire** , we can dive into the benefits of personal responsibility.

For **action** , you can include the steps in the list we created above and
add nuance to each section.

It can be as simple as that.

 **2) Turn it into a list thread on Twitter.**

List threads have been going nuts lately. This is low hanging fruit for
beginners to get their first 1000 followers or so. Just beware, don’t get
addicted to virality. You still have to incorporate the other social leverage
pillars: authority and authenticity.

Pumping out list threads will help you grow fast, but you need other content
in place to nurture your audience and educate them on your expertise.

If you spent some time on the action part of the newsletter, you should be
able to just copy and paste that into a scheduler like TweetHunter. After a
few edits, it will be good to go.

If the thread is the right size, it can be copy / pasted onto LinkedIn and
formatted into a carousel on Instagram.

Of course, plug the newsletter at the end to get some email subscribers.

 **Why Do Lists Work So Well?**

Notice how I’m ending this post with a “why” so you are persuaded to start
writing lists? ;)

You may not have been sold on lists yet, but the benefits of lists (the “why”
or emotion behind the subject) may persuade you to use them more.

Lists work well for a few reasons:

 **1) Every bullet point gives the reader a reason to engage.**

Think about the list tweet we wrote above. If the reader agrees with any of
those points, they should like, comment, or share. If they like multiple
points — they are even more likely to engage.

If they disagree with one of the points, good, they will let you know in the
replies because people can’t help themselves. You will still get more
engagement and reach.

 **2) They catch attention.**

Lists and numbers make people stop and read.

This is true for tweets, bullet points in your sales copy, or anywhere else
(like I’m writing these steps out right now).

 **3) They can be repurposed over and over.**

A list tweet can be posted and validated based on how much engagement it gets.
If it does well, you can turn it into a thread and be confident that it will
do even better (and lead to more followers and email subscribers.

Every other content format on other platforms favor lists. Instagram carousels
will show back up in users’ timelines. If they don’t swipe to the next post,
it will automatically show the second slide the next time they scroll on the
timeline — increasing your chances of getting likes, comments, or shares.

I don’t want you to become overly reliant on lists — but they should play a
crucial role in your growth strategy — which is one of the 3 social leverage
pillars.

If you aren’t growing consistently, incorporate more lists.

 **Once every day or two is a good metric.**

Delete for good?

No, keep it

Yes, delete

#  Your Digital Reality  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

Please keep in mind — we are getting into the advanced stuff here.

If you are at a beginner stage in your content creation journey, I would read
through this once but not prioritize it just yet.

If you are not seeing steady growth from your tweets, threads, engagement, and
other methods — something needs to change (whether its the content itself, the
engagement level of your replies, or quantity of connections you have made to
start growing with).

This is my way of creating your Niche Of One, Personal Monopoly, or whatever
you want to call it. The notion of becoming irreplaceable and building a loyal
audience through your content, ideas, and helping people understand (or gain
clarity).

Remember how I showed you this graphic in one of the first modules?

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/29058343_1656422314y14Creativity.png)

This brings up my notion of Digital Consciousness.

Every piece of information you become directly conscious of can be used to
create something in the digital world.

As you are dissecting certain tweets, quotes, ideas, and other pieces of
information with your _experiments_ , you are expanding your consciousness in
those specific domains. By having them written down, you can use them as
building blocks to create something of value.

I don’t want to confuse you too much with my weird theories, but I know some
of you will gain something from viewing it under this lens.

Let’s dig into the practical stuff.

 **Theorizing A Concept, Framework, Or Metaphor**

What _actually_ makes you stand out from everyone else?

What makes you _memorable_?

What makes people spread your ideas via word of mouth rather than just the
retweet button?

The ability to create a memorable way of understanding a specific idea.

That is, the ability to simplify complex topics.

The ability to make the idea “click” for somebody else.

Most of the time, you aren’t going to have revolutionary ideas. Those come
after you have had bad, good, and great ideas.

This isn’t a bad thing, it just means that you can bring a new perspective to
the idea you are trying to put across.

  * Alan Watts has the concept of “Gamble on yourself.”
  * Daniel Vasallo has the concept of “Portfolio of small bets.”
  * I’m sure a Bhuddist has some form of “Plant and water seeds daily.”
  * James Clear has the concept of “1% better every day.”
  * Jack Butcher has the concept of “Personal Monopoly”
  * I don’t know who exactly coined the term “One-Person Business” but it makes sense.

I saw this tweet from Jacob Martin and immediately DMd him to start talking
about the “Personal Portfolio” idea that he coined. There is a LOT he can go
off of from this.

> The greatest investment you can make is continually investing in yourself  
>  
> Invest in your personal portfolio. Double down on your skills and learn new
> ones  
>  
> Do this and your life gains will compound rapidly
>
> — Jacob Martin | Mindset and Productivity (@the_jacobmartin) [June 16,
> 2022](https://twitter.com/the_jacobmartin/status/1537404602357645313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Greg Doucette created his entire brand around “Harder Than Last Time”

Whenever you hear “1% better every day,” you think of James Clear, right?

You are bringing him followers and book sales just because he is living in
your head rent-free.

What is the commonality behind all of these?

  *  **They have depth** — it would take a few articles, podcasts, a course, or an entire book to explain the problems, benefits, experiences, topics, and other various things that explain that concept.
  *  **They make sense** — you can infer what these concepts, metaphors, or frameworks mean.
  *  **They are validated ideas** — these are best created from the topics that you love talking about and consistently get good engagement.
  *  **They are based off of experience** — everyone is saying the same thing under their own lens of perception.

“Portfolio of small bets” is from an investor background and attracts those
that resonate with that message.

“Plant and water seeds daily” would attract the more spiritually inclined
people.

“1% better every day” attracts the self-help crowd.

You can help people understand something without them having to know all of
the depth behind it.

That is what we are aiming for here. Understanding by creating new knowledge.
Knowledge that explains something in a simple way in a way that you understand
it best (so that your audience — that is congruent with your voice — will
understand it best.

How do you come up with these?

It takes practice and dissecting ideas from what we’ve previously discussed,
but the way I’ve found this to work best is to _visualize_ the idea.

This is why I started creating graphics for most of my newsletters.

  * I take a big idea from the newsletter I wrote
  * I brainstorm how I could visualize it
  * I draw it out on paper and iterate a few times
  * I slap a compelling name on it to help people remember it

There are a few concepts that I’ve creative over time (and for my book).
**These help me illustrate what’s already been said in a new and unique way.**

> Mental masturbation:  
>  
> The process of raising dopamine in the brain by telling people your goals,
> plans, and how you want to change but never actually doing anything about
> it.

> — DAN KOE (@thedankoe) [May 27,
> 2022](https://twitter.com/thedankoe/status/1530117108385910785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

“Mental Masturbation” came from reading about peak performance, cheap
dopamine, and how telling people your goals can release dopamine similar to
actually achieving the goal.

> Fill your brain in the afternoons with books, learning, and socialization  
>  
> Empty your brain before bed with journaling, planning, and meditation  
>  
> Use your brain in the morning with creation, output, and focus
>
> — DAN KOE (@thedankoe) [November 5,
> 2021](https://twitter.com/thedankoe/status/1456553636700504065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

“Fill Empty Use” came from reflecting on my daily routine. This could easily
be turned into a productivity product with the amount of depth it holds. It
combines teachings from eastern wisdom, modern deep work, and self-help
advice.

In my book, I use “The Game” to explain reality.

I use “The Virus” to explain the ego in relation to The Game.

I use “The Blur” to explain perspective, perception, and the dangers of
assumption.

I’ve talked about “going on a walk” enough to the point where other people are
talking about it all the time.

Most creators would get mad but that’s just the name of the game. Are you
going to become a better creator? Or get stuck in that stage like everyone
else?

I’m just going to create a concept around it and stay above them. They can’t
copy that without getting called out.

There are a few more that are used in this course:

  * Digital Consciousness
  * The Experience Model
  * The Epistemic Method (a process)
  * Intelligent Imitation (a process)
  * A few others that you may or may not remember

A lot of these will have crossovers with the processes you create. Think of
the concepts, frameworks, and metaphors as the depth behind your processes and
ideas that consistently pop up.

Your job is not to be a content creator.

It is to have fun being a concept creator.

Or if we want to create a concept right now — you are a Dopamine Dealer —
because that’s what good content does. It leads to good dopamine.​​​​​​​  

 **Your Digital Reality**

Everything is starting to tie together here.

But first, what creates reality? Perception.

What creates perception? Your vision, goals, values, and everything else that
forms your worldview. You understand the world in a unique way. Certain
interests, tones, and concepts make sense to you over others based on your
experience.

Our entire goal with our brand is to create a world and let people that align
with your world’s vision, goals, and values inhabit it.

Your products and content are the “school system” of your world.

You educate them and help them understand your teachings through your ideas,
concepts, and other forms of content.

Let’s take Greg O’Gallagher as a perfect example to illustrate this concept of
your “Digital Reality.”

Greg’s personal brand name is Kinobody.

He took the world by storm a few years back and is arguably the most memorable
and unique person in the fitness industry. Most of his advice goes against the
grain.

  * He trains 2-3 days a week.
  * He does low-volume, high-intensity training.
  * He doesn’t eat until much later in the day.
  * He doesn’t care about being massive, he wants to look good.

In short, he studied people like Martin Berkhan, started testing his own
methods of training / eating, coined a name for his concepts / theories, and
is now known for it.

He started eating and training in relation to his goals (not the goals of
others in the industry).

He is selling the “lifestyle” behind these concepts. The “why.” The vision,
values, and goals he is working towards. A greek god-like physique with big
shoulders, enough room in your diet to have red-wine and rice crispy treats,
and fun gym sessions.

He has also gone on to create new training styles by combining his own “Kino
Rep Training” and a little-known method called “Reverse Pyramid Training.”

While every other fitness creator doesn’t even believe they can create their
own training style, Greg is separating himself from the heard by doing just
that.

  * Why does he only train 2-3 days a week? Because he found that to be optimal for recovery and he values living life more than living in the gym.
  * Why does he do low-volume, high-intensity training? Because he places an emphasis on getting stronger in order to build muscle.
  * Why doesn’t he care about being massive? Because he realized the fitness industry is a tad corrupt and prefers the lean and athletic look over the huge bodybuilder look.

Can you see how he is creating his own way of doing things based off of his
prior experience and pulling from multiple sources to make them his own?

Some see this as good marketing, I see this as The Experience Model.

Why does all of this matter? Because Greg is “indoctrinating” people into his
lifestyle by marketing a compelling argument for it.

I have personally been intermittent fasting, doing his training style, and
drink black coffee in the mornings because of him. It is a huge part of my
life. I am a happy inhabitant of his Digital Reality and I market his products
whenever somebody asks me what I do for my health.

I would highly recommend watching Greg. He comes off a tad cocky at times but
his marketing is on point.

__

Your Reality = Your Worldview

Your perceived reality is just that, perceived.

It is your worldview.

It has been formed from all of your prior experiences, values, beliefs,
biases, etc.

What worldview are you inviting people to adopt with your brand, content, and
products?

**How To Outline Your Reality**

This entire phenomenon of creating your own concepts and the meaning behind
them (through experimentation, reflection, and experience) started to click
for me when I outlined my first book.

How did I do that?

  * I re-read the books that changed my life
  * I noted the ideas that stuck in my head and formed my thinking
  * I started piecing together those ideas into a book

From those ideas, I sat with them for a bit and eventually came up with my own
way of viewing them.

This entire outline has a lot of potential.

  * You can start writing the book and fleshing out the concepts with your newsletter.
  * You can start testing the names and validity of your ideas with tweets.
  * You can use your OWN concepts as your interests in the Domain Of Mastery (talk about “creating” your own niche)

This is better shown in video format to tie all of this together.

Delete for good?

No, keep it

Yes, delete

#  Creating Clarity  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

Throughout the entirety of your online journey, you will be pursuing your own
path and achieving things that other people will want to learn from you.

Every single one of you will be creating a unique path that gets you the
results you want. That unique path is the most valuable information you can
obtain (and eventually sell or teach).

  

> Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society
> can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you.
>
> Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion
> rather than whatever is hot right now.
>
> Specific knowledge can be taught through apprenticeships or self-taught.
> It's high paying because society has not yet figured out how to teach or
> automate it. It tends to be creative or technical. Build specific knowledge
> where you are “a natural.”
>
> — Naval

  

Throughout this course, you will be apprenticing under me in a controlled
environment. I am teaching you the specific knowledge I have acquired
throughout my years of self-education.

I have built this course with specific knowledge in mind.

I can teach you what worked for me — but you will need to self-educate along
the way.

If you want to understand this from a philosophical viewpoint — [I wrote an
article on how to build a creative income.](https://thedankoe.com/how-to-make-
money-as-a-creative-on-the-internet/)

​​​​​​​In that article we go over this image:

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28735749_1655131100tdBCreativity.png)

This is how you gain specific knowledge.

This is how you build creative systems that solve your audience's problems
(that are worth a lot of money with a service business or digital product).

This is how you order consciousness in yourself and others (creating clarity
and removing uncertainty).

  * The white dots are what you've experienced, failed, and gotten feedback on (how you create a system).
  * The black dots are what you haven't exposed yourself to, haven't learned about, or aren't able to tap into when building.
  * The white line that connects the dots is your way of solving a specific problem.

This solution is unique to you. Nobody can compete with it. You can either
sell that solution or keep it to yourself for leveraging results.

Thinking back, this is how I gained over 120,000 followers in a week on
Instagram.

The knowledge didn't come from a course. It came from depth, learning, and
exposure to everything that would result in creating a system for consistent
Instagram growth.

When you document your findings through your content online, you can come back
and piece together a solution.

 **6 Steps To Acquiring Specific Knowledge & Building Creative Systems (That
You Can Sell In The Future)**

The traditional learning model sucks.

It teaches you to memorize what you learn, do homework, and eventually put
those skills to use (and end up just being trained on how to do a specific job
without using anything you learned).

Here is a better way to learn. A way that will arm you with specific
knowledge.

This process is assuming that you understand the basics, principles, or
fundamentals of whatever you are trying to execute on. If you have absolutely
no idea where to start, refer back to [this module in Digital Economics
101.](https://portal.digitaleconomics.school/login/post/198)

 **1) Start and outline a personal project.**

Do not start learning first.

You already know what project you need to start right now.

That project is your personal brand.

Creating an outline will make you aware of what you know (and what you don't
know).

Why is this important? **Because you need to learn with context.** Don't just
learn aimlessly without having something to apply your learnings to.

 **In relation to the visual above** — you are creating the outer circle that
you can start to explore and learn about. This circle will represent your
Domain Of Mastery that we will discuss soon.

 **2) Choose a related successful project to emulate.**

There is somebody out there that has created what you want to create. That's
why you want to create it in the first place... because you were exposed to it
and know it's possible.

If I want to build a beautiful landing page, would I not research others for
inspiration?

If I want to write an incredible tweet, would I not research high-performing
tweets?

If I want to grow a personal brand, would I not research brands that are doing
it right?

This goes for anything.

 **In relation to the visual** — this is how you gain clarity on the desired
outcome you are trying to achieve.

 **3) Start the project with your current knowledge.**

Do not learn first.

Start first.

When you have a clear outline and a project to emulate — your brain is primed
to tie your life and business experiences to that specific project (making it
easier to act from a place of inspiration).

 **In relation to the visual** — this is how you make your first step into the
unknown and make the turn the first circle from black to white.

 **4) Immerse yourself in a conducive environment.**

If your digital or physical environment is littered with distractions, you
will get distracted.

If your digital or physical environment is filled with inspiration and
relevant information — you will constantly be reminded

This alone will help you gain clarity WHILE you are building the project out.

Follow social media accounts, buy books, buy courses, and invest your time and
attention into all facets of actualizing the project you are trying to create.

 **In relation to the visual** — immersing yourself in related information
will start to give you deeper awareness, turning more black dots to white.

 **5) Self-educate to fill in the gaps.**

Too many people ask vague questions about getting started when the answer is
to just start.

When you encounter a _specific problem_ THAT is when you start asking
_specific questions_.

Answers to specific questions are easier to find on YouTube, Google, or any
other resource.

People on Twitter or elsewhere are happier to answer specific questions
because they are easier to answer. A generic question will only take more time
to answer because they will need to ask 3-5 clarifying questions just to know
what the specific question is.

When you search for specific questions for the specific project you are
learning — you build the project much faster (and only learn what you need to,
no fluff).

 **In relation to the visual** — when you don't know what the next step is,
you must self-educate to turn that black dot into a white dot.

 **6) Document what worked and iterate from there.**

Systems.

How do you develop systems that get results?

You execute, get feedback, execute, get feedback, repeat, and document it all
so you can replicate those results.

You have to know what doesn't work before you can know what works.

You MUST encounter problems that are unique to the project you are working on.

When you solve those problems, document:

  * What the problem was
  * What you learned to solve it
  * What results you got

Now you have something valuable to pass down to your followers.

The Notion dashboard will aid in all of this.

Get in the habit of writing down all of your discoveries.

 **You learn the most in life after a period of struggle.**

Programmers know this well:

  * You spend time coding
  * You encounter a bug or error
  * You try to fix it with your current knowledge
  * You research how to solve it online
  * You bang your head against the wall because you can't figure it out
  * You take a break, let your subconscious make connections, and find the answer

Once that answer works (a positive result) it is solidified in your mind.

You won't make that mistake ever again.

You have just gained specific knowledge.

THAT is how you learn.

 **In relation to the visual** — you can piece together specific dots and turn
it into content, a product, or a service.

__

Dive Into The Unknown

Dive into the unknown (outline a project and start immediately).

Collect the dots (emulate others, immerse yourself in an environment, and
self-educate).

Connect the dots (gain clarity, create systems, and document what worked).

Then, teach the system.

Delete for good?

No, keep it

Yes, delete

#  Unlimited High Performing Tweets  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my
favorites")

Tweet writing is mostly about catering to human nature.

You can study algorithms all day (and it is very helpful to do so)… but when
you know what makes people engage and share your content, algorithms start to
matter less.

When you immerse yourself in proper tweet writing, you start to think in
concise and impactful sentences.

Over time, short-form writing will become second nature to you.

 _Writing good, engaging tweets will transfer over into high engagement on all
other platforms._

 **Generating Unique Ideas**

There are a million different ways to generate ideas for tweets (or any length
of content).

This is a problem because it get’s overwhelming. Eventually you will find an
idea generation that you prefer, gets results, and is sustainable. But you
have to try most of them before you get to that point.

The problem for most people:

They are afraid to use a tweet structure because they think they are copying.

What the problem actually is:

Your ideas aren’t original and you feel like you have to copy the entire idea
and structure itself.

The structure is for writing out the idea in a high performing way.

 **If you want potentially viral ideas, find them from:**

  * YouTube
  * Instagram
  * Medium
  * TikTok
  * Pinterest

Anywhere where you can see how much engagement those posts have.

You can use the [Growing As A
Beginner](https://portal.digitaleconomics.school/login/post/229) guide to
generate ideas this way.

 **If you want original perspectives that can be turned into viral ideas:**

  * Read books
  * Listen to podcasts
  * Listen to audiobooks
  * Listen to long YouTube lectures YT premium (so you can listen with your screen off)
  * Read Blinkist or Shortform summaries

THEN you can plug the ideas you have into a structure that can potentially
perform well.

I personally like listening YouTube lectures and audiobooks.

How to capture ideas that come to mind while you are consuming:

We are slowly going to start incorporating a method that will lead into the
next module nicely (when we develop our ideas and build a database of
concepts).

  * Consume information using the methods above
  * Have “The Queue” in the Notion Command Center open on your phone
  * Be ready to capture and potentially flesh out any ideas you have
  * When you come back to create content, plug those ideas into a tweet structure

This is how you balance having original ideas that stem from your curiosity
AND have them perform well.

 **Tweet Structures To Emulate**

Imitate than innovate.

You start writing good tweets by using structures that are proven to do well.

I see too many people (especially at the beginning) trying to create their own
unique tweets. They end up not growing and blaming the algorithm.

My advice: _**do what works**_ (but with your own ideas).

 _The tweet structures below are in addition to what is already in the
Inspiration Lab inside the Notion Command Center._

 **Commentary On Objections Or Advice**

These tweets come from paying attention to your inner dialogue.

When you hear something — how do you respond in your head?

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28915277_1655826025vrj1467467551550713859.png)

 **“Extreme” Advice**

You don’t have to curse. You just have to transfer the energy by using better
words.

What advice worked for you in the past that you want to give to others?

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28915287_1655826067Vtr1422931098426908679.png)

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28915289_16558260797yC1538861422779764738.png)

 **Metaphors**

Can you help people understand your perspective by using metaphors?

You can search for good metaphors online and plug your ideas into those as
well.

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28915299_1655826107Ce1metaphor.jpg)

 **Personal Definitions**

How would you define a word or phrase?

You can write these quick by just writing out a word that comes to mind and
creating your own definition for it.

“Long walks are…”

“Confidence is…”

“Focus is…”

You can write these for all of your interests and sub-topics within your
Domain Of Mastery.

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28915313_1655826183MIE1472903372147728394.png)

 **Repetitive Advice & Comparisons**

The best way to write this is to just start with a one-sentence piece of
advice and brainstorm different variations of that sentence.

(This works for lists as well once you have the word or sentence as the theme
of the post)

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28915324_1655826212J6w1445348302074089480.png)

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28915341_1655826250k851452262612939513861.png)

 **This Comes After This**

Like a story, one thing comes after the next. Write down one word, what it
leads to, and what comes next — then refine and edit.

These ones take some brainpower and time to write, but they work.

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28915355_16558262775vtthiscomesafter.jpg)

 **If This, Then That**

This is similar to polarity but starts with “if.”

“If you [this]…” then what?

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28915376_1655826328MUD1436681954741600259.png)

 **Harsh Truth With A Hook**

Harsh truths in general always work well.

You can add a hook to the top that describes or warns about the advice you are
going to give.

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28915381_1655826360dPqharshtruth.jpg)

 **Your Personal Way Of Doing Something Common**

How do you like doing something that other people do?

This requires you to be observant about how you go about your days.

 **Polarity & Repetition**

Polarity is about comparing two different things. Either opposites or just
making slight, nuanced connections.

 **Unique Advice Or Hacks**

These can either be hacks you find online or discover yourself.

My laptop was going to die at a coffee shop one day. It made me focus more and
try to get my work done. It worked. So I turned it into a good tweet (that
ended up going mega-viral on TikTok)

 **A list That Describes A Certain Group Of People (That You Identify With &
Want To Attract)**

Can you describe the traits of yourself or the community you are in?

People will try to lump themselves into having (or not having) those traits.
Those that have them will engage and follow.

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28915476_1655826548MVWdescriptive-

 **Interesting Observation**

Simple. Notice something interesting and talk about it.

(You can add a hook to the top as well)

 **Subtweeting Yourself**

If you are slacking, what advice would you give yourself?

Think of Twitter like a journal where you give high-engaging advice to
yourself (but positioned at others).

 **You Can Do This… But You Have To**

What is the desired outcome and what is required to get there?

Bonus points if you can use numbers, timeframes, and traits that need to be
adopted as a person.

 **Making People Aware Of A Problem Or Solution**

What is causing a problem and what is the solution?

 **Unique Perspectives On A Common Problem**

Take a common problem or perspective and give inspiration or a solution to it.

 **The Best & Worst**

What is the best, greatest, worst, most terrible thing someone can do?

This is about thinking in extremes, which is entertaining.

 **More Ways To Structure Tweets**

 **Joining The Online Conversation**

Did you read a tweet that you don’t agree with? Post your personal opinion or
perspective.

Did reading one of your replies spark an idea in you? Did replying to others
give you a new perspective on what they are talking about? You can turn your
replies or inner commentary into tweets.

 **Identifying And Solving A Problem In Your Life**

What are you struggling with and how do you plan to solve it?

This is another reason why reflection is important.

 **Horizontal And Vertical Questioning**

Branching into new mental pathways is a matter of questioning.

Who, what, when, where, how, why.

You can come up with a tweet topic, like “strategy” and start questioning.

  * Why would someone need a strategy? To do something more efficiently.
  * What can they do more efficiently? Create content, code, train, anything.
  * How can they be efficient with creating content? Now I can create a list of how to speed up their content creation.

Let thoughts trigger thoughts through questioning to come up with better
ideas.

 **Turning 1 Idea Into 1000**

The secret to all of this is just exchanging words.

That’s all copywriters do. They have set structures and manipulate different
verbs, adjectives, nouns, stories, concepts, metaphors, examples, and more to
create unlimited ideas for themself.

One quick tip: you can use [PowerThesaurus](https://www.powerthesaurus.org/)
to ideate better adjectives and words in general (to improve the impact and
strength of your writing.

#  LinkedIn  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

LinkedIn as a company has biases. I’ve spoken with Justin Welsh and Tim
Denning (LinkedIn masters) and they both stress this.

You WILL have to be a bit more politically correct and self-censor if you want
to grow on LinkedIn. Tim Denning has been banned from the platform multiple
times for no apparent reason.

However, LinkedIn has the most money flowing on the timeline. People have cash
in hand, are used to being pitched, and enjoy improving their professional
skill sets.

It is a great place to go if you have a validated product or service and want
to send hot traffic to it.

 **How To Repurpose Your Content For LinkedIn**

There are 3 things you will have to pay attention to with LinkedIn in
comparison to Twitter:

  * Your hook
  * The length of your post
  * The “Read More” feature

Creating the perfect hook for LinkedIn has more constraints than Twitter. It
will take some creativity.

LinkedIn allows for longer posts. You can use this to expand on your Tweets
(if you want to) or condense your threads to fit the character limit on
LinkedIn posts.

I have been testing writing my Twitter threads on LinkedIn first.

I will write a full post on LinkedIn, then expand on certain parts in a
Twitter thread. This will take some creativity as you need to take into
account tweet length and structure (for the thread) when you are writing your
LinkedIn post.

 **How To Send Traffic With LinkedIn**

You will have to switch your LinkedIn account to a “creator account” if you
want to take full advantage of everything we discuss here.

The best way to send traffic through LinkedIn is with comments.

If you include a link in the post itself (like Twitter) the impressions will
get throttled. Social media platforms don’t like users leaving their platform.

So instead:

  * Include a strong call to action at the end of your posts.
  * Tell them that they can find the link to whatever you are promoting in the comment section.
  * Use the comment to add nuance and plug the link.

There are also a few nuances to how you can direct traffic with your bio.

The “Featured” section of your profile is a great place to link your
newsletter, lead magnets, and / or flagship products.

 **How To Leverage Others' Audiences With LinkedIn**

From my experience and the LinkedIn experts that I’ve networked with — almost
every share feature is useless.

You will want to focus on getting comments on your posts.

Comments on LinkedIn are the same as retweets on Twitter — that is how you
show up on other people's feeds.

As always, I would recommend using the Mastermind group structure from module
2 when you decide to take a new platform seriously (and have the time to do so
until the system becomes seamless and integrated).

#  The Greatest Skill  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

Every. Single. Skill you can learn that will help you succeed in this space is
amplified by **persuasion.**

  * Persuasion is what separates the accounts that grow from those that don't.
  * Persuasion is what separates the accounts that make money from those that don't.
  * Persuasion is what separates the accounts that have their value heard from those who don't.

The deciding factor of all (ethical) transactions in your social, financial,
professional, and personal life depends on your ability to persuade.

Persuasion, in a nutshell, is how you convince someone to believe something.

I like to think of it as _creating an argument_ to **adopt your perspective
and see the benefit in viewing things in the way that you do**. (We systemize
this with my APAG persuasive writing framework).

Again, we are looping back to pains and benefits.

  * What are the downsides of viewing things from a certain perspective and the day-to-day pains associated with it?
  * What are the upsides of viewing things from a new perspective and the day-to-day benefits associated with it?
  * What is the process for getting there and can you make it simple enough to act on immediately?

If you kept those 3 questions in mind when creating — your engagement, sales,
authority, and perceived value will shoot through the roof.

The more specific, confident, and credible you can be with this argument, the
better.

(You make an argument credible by pulling from different sources
(perspectives) — these do not have to be scientifically proven. You do this by
consuming information that you love reading and writing about.)

 **The Building Blocks Of A Persuasive Argument**

Our goal with persuasion comes down to 3 things:

 **Sparking positive behavior change** — by working people through their
levels of awareness and persuading them to fix their problems (advice only
works if it is taken). This applies to content, products, and services.
Behavior change is what makes people remember you for changing their life.

 **Getting the conversion** — Making the sale, scheduling a date, getting
engagement, having your content shared, etc. There has to be an exchange of
value here, a transaction.

 **Mutual benefit** — the difference between manipulation and persuasion is
the benefit. We want to aim to deliver _more_ value than what we receive.

There are 6 building blocks for crafting a persuasive argument:

 **1) Reciprocity**

Our social evolution makes us feel compelled to return favors, even if it's
something like a compliment on someone's work (in exchange for something like
a retweet).

When you give value without expectation of repayment, others feel compelled to
return the favor.

This can take form as a free guide, a bonus product for a promotion, sending
someone a strategy you learned, or just wishing someone a happy Monday.

In short, give out value and good things will come to you.

This can also be used in negotiation with a price anchor — you start high and
work low.

When you do them the favor of dropping the price (intelligently) they feel
compelled to meet that favor.

 **2) Commitment / Consistency**

Humans feel obligated to follow through with their word.

When they say they are going to do something, they begin to justify to
themselves why they should do it.

A "commitment" here can be as simple as liking a post, clicking a link,
filling out a form, etc.

In the creator business, this can be used by easing people into things and
getting them to take the lowest friction action first — that is the
commitment.

After one commitment, they feel compelled to continue on that commitment —
leading to making larger and larger commitments (think of a funnel).

Here is an example sequence of commitments from low-friction to high:

  * Read the hook of a Twitter thread
  * Click the tweet to read the entire thread
  * Finish the thread because they've already started reading it
  * Retweet the thread based on your call to action at the bottom
  * Click the landing page to download your lead magnet
  * Read through the lead magnet
  * Click the call to action to buy your product
  * Go through the product
  * Click the call to action to fill out a qualifying questionnaire (for your service)
  * Get on a call to learn more about your service
  * Pay the invoice to become a client of yours

Can you see how we go from low-commitment to high-commitment as you bring
people deeper into your funnel and content ecosystem (that we will be building
out)?

Keep this in mind at all times. It works for everything.

Even in my Instagram carousels.

I start with a short and punchy sentence that once they finish, seems like a
small commitment has been made.

Then as they scroll through the carousel, I bring in deeper and deeper topics,
eventually leading to a call to action to download something of mine and bring
them deeper into my funnel.

 **3) Social Proof**

People are not confident in their day to day actions. We are constantly
looking to confirm our beliefs, choices, and actions.

Because of this, we look to others beliefs, choices, and actions to see if
something is credible or not.

Social proof — like testimonials, results, and word of mouth marketing is the
most powerful persuasion tool in your arsenal. The more authentic and non-
planned, the better.

A sales page with a few words and tons of social proof will always outperform
a sales page with tons of words and low social proof.

Other examples of social proof:

  *  **The engagement on a post** — When I post a screenshot of a tweet to Instagram with the engagement included, I get more engagement because other people have already liked it and validated the idea. If I retweet a post that has 100 likes, it will do better than if I retweet a post with 2 likes.
  *  **The amount of followers you have** — at the start, you will grow slower simply because you don't have much social proof. We talk about ways to work around this in the Bachelors curriculum.
  *  **The amount of customers one has** — I have 1000+ members inside Modern Mastery HQ, so I flex that.

How often an idea is talked about — If everyone starts talking about how seed
oils are bad, many are going to hop on the train without doing any research
themselves.

There are many variations of social proof. Start searching for creative ways
to use it in your hooks (like statistics), posts, and promotions.

 **4) Liking**

You are more likely to trust and be persuaded by somebody that you like.

This displays the power of a properly executed personal brand.

With a personal brand, you are guiding people's perception of you.

If you are speaking to a specific group of people with similar interests as
you, it is likely that they like who you are.

This alone will have people buying from you as opposed to a huge brand that is
selling a similar product.

 **Last tip on liking:** We tend to like people that like us.

You see this in social situations all the time. Just by being interested in
the other person and liking what you see, the other person starts to like you
in return.

 **5) Authority**

We tend to trust authoritative figures much quicker than less authoritative
people.

Authority is determined by:

  * Level of expertise
  * Accomplishments in a specific area
  * Well known labels, symbols, or achievements (like the Nobel Prize, NYT Best Seller, or just something like a police uniform)
  * Amount of social proof
  * Celebrity or micro-celebrity status
  * Speaking with confidence and using absolutes (wisely)

All of these can be baked into our brand, content, and products with a bit of
tacticality, self-development, and creativity.

 **6) Scarcity**

In other words, FOMO.

When Bitcoin skyrockets, people buy more out of emotion.

When Bitcoin drops hard, people sell more out of emotion.

The best traders and investors know that this isn't when you are supposed to
buy and sell, but we do it anyway.

Scarcity is a gauge for how valuable something is — simple supply and demand.

This can be abused very easily — so ease into your use of scarcity and do your
best to be ethical about it.

Scarcity can be worked into your content or products.

For example, one reason why cohorts like this sell very well is because there
is a deadline for enrollment. The last day is always the day you make more
sales.

The same goes for special product launches, limited quantities available,
deadlines on promotional offers, and the rest.

 **These come from Robert Cialdini's book _Influence._**

All of those 6 building blocks solve fixed action patterns in one's brain. In
essence, by including more of these to form a persuasive argument, you are
making it seamless for people to get what they want out of your brand,
content, and products.

__

Be Mindful

Whenever you are writing or speaking, put effort into constructing a
persuasive argument for the sake of a positive beneficial outcome.

This will hurt your brain at first. Give it time and practice — it will become
second nature.

**The Conversion Process**

There are many persuasion, storytelling, and sales frameworks out there (those
3 things are all the same in structure).

The purpose of all of these is to get people to act — or to convert — at
whatever part of the funnel they are in (again, keep levels of awareness in
mind here).

I have distilled the patterns in these frameworks into a simple and hopefully
understandable process that you can use for every touchpoint of your brand,
content, and products.

You can treat these as an extra 6 practical building blocks for persuasion if
you would like. You can piece them together for impactful short or long-form
content.

These can be used individually for short form content, or in step-by-step
succession for longer form content.

 **1) The Big Problem**

Almost every story, sales page, and even tweet has a problem that is
explicitly stated or implied by describing a part of the situation.

The big problem can branch into smaller problems that people experience
because of that problem.

By painting a picture of the problem that an individual is facing, you begin
to make them aware of it and seek a solution.

This usually occurs in the introduction or "lead" of a long-form piece of
content.

 **2) Agitate & Dig Deeper**

On a sales call, your job is to be a doctor. You ask questions to dig deeper
and understand what pain this is actually causing the problem.

In content, you don't have to ask questions, but you can guide people deeper
into how the big problem is impacting their experience (raising their
awareness even more).

 **3) Relatability**

Like social proof, people want their beliefs, choices, and actions to be
confirmed. See "confirmation bias" in psychology.

If you can relate to the problems people are experiencing with personal or
client stories, you show them that change is possible — and that they aren't
in the wrong.

This is also why memes do so well. They help people feel like they aren't
alone.

 **4) Benefits**

Can you see how this is forming a story-like structure?

Humans love transformations (just look at physique transformations on
YouTube).

Transformations are inspirational — but they don't have to be literal
transformations.

The _thought_ of an implied transformation by showing the benefits to
overcoming certain problems is a transformation in itself.

If readers' awareness levels are high enough, that is when they will act on on
the step-by-step solution you give them.

When you are talking about a product, the usual option is to flex the
"features" of that product rather than the benefits of those features. Both
are necessary, but the benefits are what sell.

A benefit is how their life is affected on a direct and _specific_ level.
Specificity is key here.

 **Feature** : 1 gigabyte of storage.

 **Benefit** : Never run out of space for storing memories of your newborn
son.

The latter is targeted at a _specific type of person_ that would use the 1
gigabyte of storage in a _specific way._

Can you guess what the type of person is and how we are painting a picture of
how they would use that feature? (You don't have to be explicit. Often times
it is better to be implicit. Let the reader fill in the blanks with their
imagination.)

The best way to register this type of benefits rich language is to keep your
eyes peeled for content and landing pages that do it well.

 **5) The Perfect Solution**

As we are crafting this argument with pains, agitation, relatability, and
benefits — we are raising peoples awareness to the point of becoming aware of
a solution.

This is your chance to present one that is perceived as the near-perfect
solution for them in that situation.

That is the thing here, this solution is _perceived_ as the perfect solution
based on the argument you've constructed (the reality you've created through
communication and framing the argument).

Your job is to position a solution according to the problem and person you are
speaking to.

Your job is to cause that raise in dopamine that sparks the "aha!" moment. The
breakthrough. The "this may finally be the solution to my problem."

 _Then, you deliver as much value as you possibly can to fulfill that
promise._

Keep in mind that this argument is constructed in different ways across your
entire brand. That is where the fun and creativity come into play.

 **6) Clarity On Next Steps**

"How to" guides always do well for one reason — it gives people the one thing
they crave (and often lack — _clarity._

The best call to actions at the end of a post give step by step, low-friction
ways of guiding the reader to take the next action (or make the next
commitment).

You see this:

  *  **In Twitter threads** — "Go to the first tweet that is linked here, press the retweet button, come back, and read the next tweet."
  *  **In Call To Actions** — "Buy Now" - "Download the free guide"
  *  **In How To Guides** — Giving clear and actionable steps to achieving a desired outcome

The more specific you can get with this, the better. People often need step-
by-step instruction on what to do next.

Play The Game

Play the game of influence until you become so good that you can be artful
with your craft and "draw outside of the lines."

Train your mind to think in terms of problems and benefits that occur in any
given situation. This is how you turn topics, life experiences, and random
thoughts into compelling content.

#  What To Expect In Digital Economics  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my
favorites")

Digital Economics is the result of 5+ years of iteration in freelancing,
consulting, digital product sales, multiple failed brands, community building,
and audience growth condensed into simple systems that have proven to get
results time and time again.

I have used these exact systems and strategies to generate 6 figures in _each_
of these domains (freelancing, consulting, digital product sales, community
memberships, and brand deals).

I also used these systems to pull in my first $50K month while "working" less
than 2 hours a day.

Nothing I have done is special or anywhere near off limits for others to
achieve.

However, I have struggled with your same problems.

My mind was filled with questions and lack of clarity during many low moments
in business.

I know how it is — and I still struggle to this day — but I have the answers
that most people are looking for when it comes to **doing what they love and
making more than enough money to live a fulfilling life.**

My goal is to give you all of the resources you need (that you can come back
to at any time) when you feel lost, want to make more sales, want to grow
faster, or want to harness your creative energy for spreading a good word in
this world.

 **Who Will Benefit The Most From This Course?**

While I believe that everyone should learn how to navigate the digital
economy, this course is for a select few people.

I like to call them **value creators**.

In other words, people that are trying to improve the lives of others by
consuming, synthesizing, developing, creating, and selling _value._

 **Who is this for _exactly_? People who want to:**

  * Develop their personal and professional skill set
  * Learn how to ethically persuade, influence, and sell
  * Make a positive contribution to someone's life or business
  * Raise their level of consciousness and knowledge surrounding topics they are passionate about
  * Gain clarity on their purpose and life's work while harnessing the power of the internet to pull in enough money to sustain that work
  * Build a public resume through value creation and have modern opportunities find you
  * Learn how to create impactful content by understanding human nature and psychology
  * Build a one-person business as a freelancer, consultant, online educator, or knowledge worker

 **Who is this not for?**

  * Those that don't see the value in personal growth and positive impact
  * Those that intentionally — or unintentionally — seek to harm others through negative content (certain memes, pornography, etc)
  * Those that have a distorted perception of money, sales, and taking the impact of what you put out into the world seriously
  * On the business side of things — those that are set on pursuing a hyper-focused niche for freelancing, agency work, and other things

On that last point — this is for those that want to talk about their interests
and curiosities _while_ selling life-changing products (not those that are
focused on _only_ talking about the niche topic related to what they are
selling — there is nothing wrong with this, just clarifying who will see the
best results from this)

 **What Will You Learn?**

There are a lot of moving parts to the digital economy. This course reflects
that and is structured accordingly.

 **In Digital Economics 101 you will learn:**

  * The foundational information for succeeding as a value creator
  * The unconventional mindset that you will need to adopt to succeed in this uncertain and unpredictable line of work
  * The relationship between your skills, interests, and expertise (and how they create an irreplaceable brand)
  * A breakdown of the skills, terms, and methods for communicating your value and putting a price tag on it
  * The true (and only) way to make a sustainable income source with your time and creations
  * The key to becoming someone who is taken seriously for their "original" and impactful thoughts, ideas, and work
  * Actionable steps that you can take right now to start growing on social media, networking with high-level individuals, and making your first sale
  * Digital Economics is a free mini-course that is available to everyone. It acts as a primer for those that plan to take the Bachelors and/or Masters degree curriculum.

 **In the Bachelors Curriculum you will learn:**

  * How to create an irreplaceable personal brand based on the combination of your interests, skills, and expertise
  * How to attract an audience — or community — of like-minded people that have similar goals, interests, and a vision for their future
  * How to generate unlimited content ideas, articulate your thoughts, and package them up into digital assets that grow in value over time
  * My process for creating a content ecosystem that automates trust building, promotions, and sales without gimmicks, tricks, or hacks
  * The best way to create long, medium, and short-form content that can be distributed on all social platforms (without spending all day writing, filming, editing, or designing)
  * How to pivot your brand, content, and products as you grow as an individual — your brand will evolve with you (as will your income)

This is all real-world project-based for rapid learning and understanding.

This is fast-paced and carefully crafted to help you see results faster than
you would studying by traditional methods — albeit you will go through much
uncertainty at times (this is necessary, embrace it).

We will be implementing my time-tested systems into your brand and refining
them to your unique needs. This is fleshed out in the Notion Command Center
that you will (hopefully) be using and refining for a long time.

By the end of the Bachelors curriculum, you will have clarity on the next 3
years of your brand, a growing (and monetizable) audience, and a content
creation system that will separate you from the sea of other creators.

 **In the Masters Curriculum you will learn:**

  * How to package up your knowledge into a consulting, freelance, or digital product that outperforms other products on the market
  * How to build out a sales page, email funnel, and promotion system that fits your content strategy to perfection
  * A streamlined way of leveraging ALL of your distribution network for a potential 6 figure launch (and how to extend the "shelf life" of your products and services to keep pulling in revenue)
  * How to turn readers into product buyers into high ticket service clients — rounding out your sales system and increasing the lifetime value of each customer
  * The best way to promote your products and services without adding more to your daily work (and without sounding salesy, needy, or spammy)

The Masters curriculum is best suited for those that have an offer that they
can't charge $5K+ for, aren't making the sales they want, or are confident in
their skill set to the point where they are ready to monetize (and skip the
beginner mistakes).

#  How To Leverage Twitter Threads  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my
favorites")

_****_

I want to make this clear:

Threads should be the first thing to go if you are feeling overwhelmed. Focus
on quality newsletters and tweets above all.

Do not try to force them into your content ecosystem if

It is better to have few, well-written, and strategically placed threads for:

  * Building authority
  * Launching a lead magnet, product, or service
  * Bringing in more leads and sales for your products and services

They are also incredible for growth when you are just starting out — but only
if you can get eyes on them. If you don’t have anyone to boost your threads
(from networking with others or paying for shares) then I would focus on well-
written tweets, replies, and developing your thoughts in your newsletter.

From what I can remember, I did not write threads for the first 3-6 months of
my Twitter journey. No matter how necessary people may make them seem, they
are not.

 ** _They are a bonus, not a necessity._**

The thing is, you WILL need some deeper content to build authority, trust, and
eventually make an income. If it’s a battle between threads or newsletters for
you, **and you can’t nearly force the threads to go viral with retweets** , I
would drop the threads from your weekly content flow — _but write them when
it’s time to establish authority in a specific area_.

 _ **Threads are just expanded tweets. (Or other validated ideas you have).**_

If a tweet did well for you, you can almost guarantee it will do even better
as a thread.

“Focused work” tweets always did well for me:

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28914589_1655824325rbC1276834013831925761.png)

So I turned it into a thread:

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28914601_1655824364oRk1397622613611094027.png)

The best way to learn thread writing is the same you would anything else.

Understand the principles (this course), choose a thread to emulate, come up
with an idea, outline it, write it, post it, get better next time.

 **How To Pick A Thread Topic**

There are a few types of threads that do very well:

  * A numbered list with short or long insights about each point.
  * A story of yourself or a client that accomplished something your audience wants to accomplish. (Transformation)
  * Search for multiple variations of an idea you have on Google and make your own spinoff of a blog or YouTube video headline.
  * Calling out a problem your target audience and teaching them how to solve it.

This part should be easy. Type parts of your into Google, YouTube, Medium, or
just go off the top of your head. You can use the “[Getting Started With
Content On The Right
Foot](https://portal.digitaleconomics.school/login/post/229)” section of the
first module to generate killer ideas and outlines for threads.

Take note of the headline and key talking points.

 **Principles Of Thread Writing**

Threads are about 3 things:

  1. Giving your unique perspective on a particular topic
  2. Building your expertise and authority in the Twitter space (usually beginner level)
  3. Growing fast and having more potential virality

One great thread can change everything:

  * It can bring new opportunities to your DMs
  * It can pull in 500-5,000+ followers if it gets traction
  * You can include a strong call to action for your products, services, or lead magnet (and get much more out of it then tweets alone)

Threads lead to more followers because you are holding attention longer.

You are building trust and giving people more of a reason to follow you.

There are 3 aspects of a thread — it is very similar to writing a newsletter.

 **1) The Hook**

Remember the “Attention” aspect of the last section on the APAG framework?

There are 3 things I want to remind you of:

  *  **Relevance** — how relevant is it to their everyday life? Resolved pains or potential benefits. What’s in it for the reader?
  *  **Awareness** — is it simple or complex enough for the level of awareness you are targeting? Will they understand what you are about to show them?
  *  **Effort** — how fast will they receive the result (education, entertainment, or inspiration) and is it easy to get?

Keep these in mind when we dissect certain threads.

This is where you weave in the big problem, benefit, idea, timeframe, and
possibly hint at a negative personal experience.

You are also keeping in mind different aspects of what catches attention from
the Attention & Engagement Psychology section.

Every tweet is important, but if the first one doesn’t capture their attention
and spark curiosity, the rest of the thread will go unread. Not good.

 **2) The Body**

As with any other piece of longer form content, outlining several key points
will help you start writing much easier.

The thing that is different about threads than most other medium-form or long-
form content is this:

 _ **Every tweet in the thread should be treated as a tweet itself.**_

You should be able to post EVERY tweet in the thread as a standalone tweet.

People will retweet and engage with these certain tweets in the thread which
make it perform even better.

This is difficult. Don’t stress too much over it. But if there's anything that
will make you a more concise writer, it’s trying to fit your point into a
280-character tweet within a thread.

 _Remember: throughout the thread, you can mention larger accounts that talk
about that point. They may RT the thread and give it exposure._

 **3) The Call To Action**

Threads are incredible for sending traffic, but there are a few things you can
include when you are finished with the thread.

  * Recap everything you talked about into a bullet point list (if applicable and doable)
  * Ask people to either retweet the first tweet of the thread, follow you, or both
  * Plug your newsletter, product, or service to not let the traffic go to waste (you are allowed to plug on every single thread because it is longer and more valuable).
  * Optional: tag a list of people that inspired the thread or that are worth following, they may retweet your thread to give it more exposure.

Always send thread readers to a next step. Even if it’s just asking them to
follow you.

__

Be Careful

If you are writing an incredible thread to a small audience, you have to
create a strategy for getting more eyes on it.

The best way to do this is with the [Non-Needy Networking
process.](https://portal.digitaleconomics.school/login/post/228)

**Examples Of Great Threads & Why They Did Well**

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28914728_1655824588Y7q1414937660842385411.png)

(This may be a good thread to study for more thread hooks ;))

Why it did well:

  * Negativity bias and calling out the problem in the first line
  * Numbers and social proof in the second line
  * Implying that there is an information gap to find out the 22 hooks

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28914736_1655824629iZy1348001394104537089.png)

Why it did well:

  * Pattern interrupt with “THREAD” as the very first word
  * A list with confidence and negativity bias
  * Opens a curiosity loop

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28914801_1655824665qTo1002103360646823936.png)

Why it did well:

  * BIG benefit callout (from a believable source, Naval)
  * It is highly relevant to many people and “without getting lucky” implies low effort

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28914814_1655824704TPU1345855691068764161.png)

Why it did well:

  * It makes people wonder “what bad advice?”
  * It amplifies the problem in a unique way
  * It hones in on negativity

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28914828_1655824742AVQ1357002717743480834.png)

Why it did well:

  * Specific numbers and an implied transformation / benefit
  * “Without the fluff” decreases effort

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28914841_1655824773tJm1508453283106598918.png)

Why it did well:

  * Specific numbers again
  * “Sentences” implies low effort and quick result
  * It has high relevance to anyone that has taken an English class and may be interested in improving their writing

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28914855_1655824814NZQ1453725972876775424.png)

Why it did well:

  * Absolutes, exaggeration, and numbers in the first line
  * More numbers implying an information gap in the 2nd line
  * Audience callout in the 4th line
  * Relevant and attention-grabbing image

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28914872_1655824853Fos1537409684931547136.png)

Why it did well:

  * Numbers and implying a problem in the first line
  * Social proof and a transformation
  * “Dead-simple” = low effort
  * People love lists

I would highly HIGHLY recommend reading through these threads with the
intention of understanding why they do well. How do they guide you down the
page? This is how you start to develop a marketer's eye.

Start asking “why” when any piece of viral content crosses your eyes.

 _“Why did this catch so much attention?”_

 _“Why did people click through to read the thread?”_

 _“Why did people retweet this so much, but not another thread?”_

 **An example of a failed thread:**

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28914884_1655824905PbT1352366082942775296.png)

Another one from Nick but the initial tweet is too messy, it loses people's
interest.

It doesn't have 1 big idea, it doesn't spark any curiosity, and I don't
immediately see a "What's in it for me?" reason for me to continue reading.

#  Podcast  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

Podcasting is an incredible way to build a deeper connection with your
audience.

MOST of my initial ($8,000) coaching clients either came from the podcast
itself, or told me that they listened to the podcast.

Like a newsletter, you can dive deeper into topics and give necessary nuance
that can’t happen on traffic-generating platforms that favor the opposite.

Your podcast doesn’t need to be in the top 100 charts if you don’t want it to
be.

If you don’t see yourself becoming a full-time podcaster, then I wouldn’t
recommend stressing out over this or consistent guest episodes (or guest
episodes at all!)

Treat it as an audience nurturing platform over a brand growth mechanism.

See it as another layer to your newsletter for people that want to go even
deeper.

This is where your most loyal fans will go — even if you only get a few
listeners.

This isn’t exact by any means, but I would argue that 100 podcast listeners
are worth 5,000 Twitter or Instagram followers. That is what I’ve noticed.

 **Recommended Podcast Equipment & Resources**

There are many podcast distribution platforms, but the only one I have
experience with is [Anchor.fm.](https://anchor.fm)

I’ve enjoyed it so far, haven’t had any major problems, and would recommend it
to everyone.

 **Microphones**

The most affordable and quality microphone is the [Yeti
Blue](https://www.amazon.com/Microphone-Recording-Streaming-Podcasting-
Adjustable/dp/B00N1YPXW2). I would recommend that if you are just starting out
and don’t want to spend a lot of money.

The industry standard (that most big podcasters use) is the [Shure
SM7B](https://www.amazon.com/Shure-SM7B-Cardioid-Dynamic-
Microphone/dp/B0002E4Z8M). You will have to research how to best use this mic
with your computer and set up — it is more than just a USB plugin (I think).

I accidentally bought the Shure MV7 thinking it was the SM7B. It was a good
purchase, but I wish I spent a bit more for the better version.

 **Audio Editing Software**

The best audio editing software out there is
[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/). That’s all you need. There are a
plethora of tutorials online on how to use it, how to make your voice sound
professional, and how to edit your audio further.

 **Guest Interview Software**

I have tried ZenCastr, SquadCast, and a few others.
[Riverside.fm](https://riverside.fm/) has come out on top every time. It is
worth the investment if you plan on having guests on your podcasts
consistently.

Riverside also allows you to mark potential clips WHILE recording the podcast.
You can create these clips from the editor inside the software itself to
upload to other platforms.

If you don’t have the money to spend, Zoom works just fine for recording guest
podcasts.

 **How To Repurpose Your Content For A Podcast**

The podcast has gone through many iterations in the 100 or so episodes I’ve
recorded.

Lesson: don’t be afraid to change things up if you don’t like what you are
doing, aim for consistency.

Originally, I had 3 podcast episodes a week.

  * 1 guest podcast with people from Twitter (this helped me connect with A LOT of people)
  * 1 podcast with Joey to talk about self-improvement and business topics
  * 1 solo podcast where I give life updates

I did not study or buy courses on podcasting. I listened to podcasts,
struggled to emulate them, and got better (as with most things I’ve done).

Side note: the only reason I buy courses or coaching anymore is to see how
they structure everything and how they teach. That has helped me more than
being told exactly what to do (because then it is hard to teach others my own
unique methods… Experience Model)

Eventually, I got tired of guest podcasts. They stopped aligning with my
vision and I felt like I was giving away too much misinformation when I
brought health people on.

At that point, I changed the podcast to 1x a week and started using my
newsletter as a soft script. It was different from my YouTube videos because I
was going on more tangents and letting it drag on a bit longer.

Recently, I’ve decided to only talk about 1 big idea from the newsletter, my
Twitter content, or just something that I want to talk about. I keep it to 10
minutes long and it has been doing very well.

The 10-minute big ideas are a sustainable way to have an active podcast,
nurture your audience, and make more sales.

 **How To Send Traffic With A Podcast**

Simple.

You should write out a promotional script for the beginning, middle, and end
of your podcast that you can read off. This will of course be dependent on the
length of your podcast.

  * Under 15 minutes — have a promotion at the end only.
  * Between 15 and 45 minutes — have a promotion at the beginning and end.
  * Over 45 minutes — have a promotion at the beginning, middle, and end.

Use the AIDA or PAS copywriting framework to do this.

You can have an exclusive discount for podcast listeners on specific offers.
This usually works best for a digital product, physical product, or
membership. I wouldn’t recommend discounting a consulting or freelance
service.

Similar to your YouTube description, you will want to link all of your
relevant resources, products, and services in the show notes so you can direct
people there.

 **How To Leverage Others' Audiences With A Podcast**

This one should be obvious — but having guests on your podcast is how you grow
your podcast audience (if you don’t already have an audience to send to your
podcast, or if you want to become known FOR your podcast… it’s all goal
dependent).

When you bring a guest on the podcast, you achieve a few things:

  * You build a connection with that person and “add” them to your network. They will respond to you and help you grow if they can.
  * If you have a solid promotional strategy (like making clips or compelling posts) you can leverage their audience on other social platforms like Instagram.
  * You can use your podcast as a “lead with value” strategies in the DMs to bring people more exposure to their brand (so they become a part of your network).

People you want to connect with are much more likely to get on a podcast with
you than on a call, especially if they are “out of your league.”

People understand that podcasts have a HUGE lifetime value. They can be found
and referenced at any time, like a blog post. They don’t disappear after a day
like a Tweet or Instagram post. People will talk about the podcast (if it’s
good) and it will continue to grow your brand if other people are searching
for your podcast guest's name.

#  The Digital Economy  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

Over the past decade, there has been a big shift in how we do work. More
opportunities have opened up, remote work is common, and technological
advancements have begun to replace labor-intensive jobs with creative work.

There is more opportunity than ever, but only for those that are open to
shedding their prior beliefs on what "work" is.

During this shift, you may have picked up beliefs that make you think:

  * You need startup capital
  * You need a lot of experience
  * You need a lot of followers
  * You need a physical product or service location
  * You need to avoid competition and saturation
  * You have to be neurotic about profit margins, operating costs, and supply chains

All of this could not be further from the truth.

If you are more exposed and open to the digital economy, you may also think:

  * You have to be extremely good-looking to build an audience
  * You need to be insightful, wise, and produce Jordan Peterson level ideas
  * You have to be a skilled writer, speaker, video producer, and have all of this fancy equipment that is reserved to those that have money to spend on it.

Again, none of these are true.

All of this really is as simple as you make it, but we all know how hard that
can be.

In the coming sections and modules, I will be helping you shed these limiting
beliefs while giving you simple systems to help you thrive in this new
economy.

__

Assumptions Are Your Worst Enemy

If you have not experienced a common saying or piece of advice — **you have no
business adopting that as a hardset belief or assumption.**

Open your mind, test it out, and find out for yourself whether it is true or
not.

**The Reality Of The Online World We Have Created**

This course is focused on the digital aspect of all of this.

While physical products are great — and can 100% be sold from your brand — it
is almost a no brainer to have a digital product and service stack as your
foundation.

Why?

  * They cost close to nothing to create.
  * They can have 90+% profit margins (on the low end if you are a one-person business).
  * They don't have a cost for replication. Once you know they sell, all you have to do is increase the amount of traffic being sent to them.
  * For something like a freelance or consulting service — you can decrease the amount of time you spend on client work as you build leverage.

This gives you full control over your income.

Want to make more? Invest time or money into building free traffic sources.

Like an on / off button for making money.

But how do you get people to see those products?

Thankfully, you don't need to invest in a physical location. In fact, you
don't need to invest anything at all.

The coders of the world got bored of building websites & landing pages and
made that skill accessible to anyone.

What about hosting the product, booking calls, and setting up your "store
front?"

Free as well. No-code tools have made this a possibility.

"No-code tools" is just a fancy way of saying software that does the work for
you. Like little salesman that are up and running 24/7 without costing you a
dime (until you are growing fast enough to invest).

Things like:

  * Gumroad for hosting eBooks, courses, and memberships
  * Calendly for creating a call calendar and booking link
  * Carrd for building fast landing pages to sell your offers better
  * Revue or Convertkit for building an email list
  * Website builders for building a personal site
  * Social media platforms to build an audience (a traffic source like Facebook ads but at zero cost if you know how to use the platform).

All of them are free, and those are just a few. Most of them only have a cost
once you are at a point where you *should* be making more than enough money to
justify it.

 **But Dan, what about experience?**

 _Don't I have to be super skilled or an expert in a specific field?_

Well, yes, but there are ways around that. In fact, its more beneficial to
start as a beginner.

A BIG part of building an audience is educating your audience to get to the
point that you are at. That's what they want. They want to become a higher
value individual using the methods that got you to that point.

And who else is better to learn from than someone that is 1-2 steps ahead of
you?

Someone that is 10 steps ahead of you won't give you the right advice. They
are operating on a different playing field.

But someone that is 1 step ahead of you knows exactly how to navigate whatever
roadblock someone is facing.

There are tactics and strategies that will help you grow rapidly as a
beginner.

Example: teaching about a topic that you love studying.

Let's say you listened to a podcast on marketing.

You create high-performing content on that (teaching people about it).

You then tag the podcaster that you learned it from. Why?

  * Citing your sources makes your argument more credible (authority).
  * The podcaster may like, comment, or retweet — meaning you may gain followers from their big audience.
  * The podcaster will remember you, especially if the content was good, meaning you may work with them in the future.

I've worked with YouTubers and podcasters that I grew up listening to. It is
truly surreal when you understand that everyone online is a normal human like
you.

They just put in consistent reps that made them seem like some sort of
celebrity.

We will learn more about this zero-experience strategy when we talk about
Learning In Public.

From Zero To Infinity

You can start from zero.

You can scale to infinity.

Do not let any thought that tells you otherwise live in your psyche. Better
yet, if you have that thought, write about it online to understand it deeper.

**The Age Of Information**

One big limiting belief that many have is that they think information is not
inherently valuable.

This shouldn't have to be said — but all we do as human beings is process
information. That is literally it.

We go about life, process the information from our experiences, and it either
contributes to a better or worse life.

That's why we spend more time than we should soaking in educational,
inspirational, and entertaining content on social media and TV.

  * When you are socializing, you are exchanging information with others.
  * When you are walking down the road, you are exchanging information with the environment.
  * When you are alone, you are exchanging information with yourself.

Any and all of this can (and should) be turned into content.

Information is everything. It is the foundation of all communication and
connection. This is no different online.

However, information overload is a thing.

When we go over the APAG persuasive writing framework — you will learn how to
produce memorable information that improves others' direct human experience.

The human experience is partially determined by information. _Is there
anything more worthy of your time than producing information that improves the
very foundation of the human experience?_

Make It A Habit

Be intentional and conscious of all information you are exposed to. Think
critically about how that information can be applied to everyday life.

An entire brand can be built from this alone.

**The Shift From Corporation To Community**

People are losing trust in the "system."

  * Formal education is overpriced.
  * People are craving human connection and intimacy.
  * Everyone is getting tired of centralization in every industry.

This isn't difficult to notice.

If you follow me on socials and other similar accounts, you should be well
aware of this.

You can learn more practical information by watching 20 hours of design-
related YouTube videos than with a 4 year design degree.

This goes for any discipline, not just design or industries that you have been
exposed to.

Small "boutique" brands with a ~3 person team are pulling in multiple
7-figures per year.

Personal brands that know what they are doing can pull in $20K per month with
4 hours of work per week.

As you will learn, your personal brand is what sets you apart.

Now think about it.

Do you really want to have a ton of employees and a billion-dollar company?

Or do you want to do what you love and eventually make one million a year (or
however much you want to live the life that YOU want).

To me, it's a no-brainer.

My job is to educate, entertain, and inspire my following.

However, I am not creating followers, I am creating new leaders that can
evolve as I do.

That is one thing you will learn — individuals evolve.

The information, products, and services that I used to give out have evolved
over time — when I leave, it opens up room for others to take my place.

Take Responsibility

Focus your attention on helping yourself and your community.

Pay no mind to those that don't vibe with your message.

Pay all mind to those that you can impact the most — encourage them to spread
the message — and start to leave your mark on the world.

#  The Creator Mindset  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

Whether you are taking this course to launch yourself into entrepreneurship,
landing a better job, making high-level connections, or just to have fun...

You are a creator.

With that stems a lot of potential problems.

As a society we are so used to being told what to do, when to do it, and how
to do it.

Personal responsibility, self-management, self-reflection, and the ability to
execute on your ideas are all necessities in this line of business.

Personal growth = business growth = personal growth.

  * You are your own boss
  * You are your own project manager
  * You are your own content marketer
  * You are your own sales team
  * You are everything

Don't know what to do? It is your responsibility to create your own solution.

 **Embrace The Unpredictability**

All of this is unpredictable.

You are going to feel lost, a lot.

Is there anything more that you can ask for?  

You are blessed with the opportunity to chart unknown territory and make new
discoveries.  

True content creation and solopreneurship is NOT taught in schools. Nor should
it be.  

It is very new territory. There are no formal college courses on it. There can
be no courses on it. Professors aren't content creators. The landscape is
changing every single day.  

All we have is what the online-explorers have packaged up and put into
courses. It is all experience-based.  

Yet, the only way you make life-changing discoveries is to do just that — get
lost in the unknown, adopt the mindset of an explorer, and forge your own path
to success.

The best thing you can do during these times is:

  * Brain dump journal about what you are struggling with.
  * Turn what you wrote into content (telling yourself what to do).
  * Allow that process to help you discover the problem.

Do not keep things in your head. Writing is what fills the gaps in your
thoughts.

By documenting your life, thought processes, and experiences online — not only
do you learn more about yourself, but you attract others that are experiencing
something similar in their life.

There is only so much that I can teach you.

  * I can't tell you the exact price you should put on your product.
  * I can't tell you the exact words to write that will bring in 1 million followers.
  * I can't tell you exactly what your "niche" is or should be.
  * I can't tell you every single detail that should go into your landing pages, emails, and funnels.

I can only give you guidance, principle based-systems, and a starting point
that we can iterate from.

I've changed my bio — without exaggeration — at least 100 times.

I've built 10+ different products and services, each doing better than the
next.

I've had content that has gotten 2 likes that has lost me followers and
content that has gotten 438,968 likes bringing in 120,000+ followers.

That is only possible if you stay consistent for more than 6 months and open
your mind to learning from your failures.

 _Get used to it. Let go of the need to be perfect. Have faith in the
process._

Adopt a 10-year mindset (you are going to be doing this for close to the rest
of your life, hopefully).

You will never ever feel like you know exactly what you are doing.

 **Just create.**

For the remainder of this course, I want you to take every tactic or method
you hear (outside of this course) with a grain of salt.

Stop listening to people that tell you what your content, brand, or product
are "supposed" to look like.

Put trust in my methods, the principles I teach you, and use them to create
your own way of doing things. That is how you truly succeed in this game.

> As to methods there may be a million and then some, but principles are few.
> The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The
> man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble. **—
> Ralph Waldo Emerson**

 **Stop Thinking About Saturation And Finding Your Niche**

Let's do a little thought exercise.

 _How many people do you follow?_

Probably between 100-500 people, more or less.

 _How many people do those people follow?_

Probably the same.

 _How many people do creators themselves follow?_

Again, **the same.**

This begins to paint the picture of the creator economy — the self-sufficient
Utopia.

We ALL follow people based on our unique interests.

This alone should prove to you that saturation does not exist for personal
brands.

People have similar interests, but the combination of interests? Completely
different.

If you can lean into your genuine curiosities, develop your expertise in an
area that makes money, and focus on producing high-quality content, products,
and services — you win.

This is both the hardest and easiest part.

We have to win the battle against ourselves. Against our mind, that is.

Throughout this course, we will be leaning on psychological principles to
create a brand that nobody else can compete with.

This isn't going to happen overnight. or with 1 piece of content or 1 product
- it is a lifelong game of iteration.

When you find yourself narrowly focused, stressed, and anxious about your
progress — zoom out.

Don't look at your content as 1 thing that gets posted and disappears.

The 1, 2, 3, and 4+ year culmination of your content is what makes you
irreplaceable.

Allowing longer form content to age on YouTube and podcasts are great for SEO,
but that's not the main benefit.

Once you have tested, validated ideas that you enjoy talking about — you can
grow on other platforms with ease.

You already know what topics perform well.

Since I spent 1 year growing on Twitter — I now have a database of viral posts
that I can spice up and post to any platform.

This is only possible through iteration of your content and ideas.

__

Prioritize Clarity

Clarity, centropy, and ordered consciousness are your best friend (in life and
business). Overthinking, psychic entropy, and chaos are your worst enemy.

Make it a habit to pause, write out all of your thoughts, and organize them.
**Make your mental processes _physical_.**

**The Opportunity Has Never Been Higher**

I'm not saying this as some kind of marketing gimmick to make you take
advantage. I have full conviction that everyone can own a "business."

In other words, I have full conviction that individuals can develop their
skill set, gain more than enough followers to pull in their desired income
(it's not much), and move up the creator hierarchy as far as they want to go.

There has been a short-form content boom.

TikTok has creators growing faster than ever out of nowhere.

Instagram is putting more effort into reels and trying to copy TikTok.

People can consume short-form tweets, TikToks, reels, and others _faster._

 _ **Meaning they can be exposed to more creators.**_

 _ **Meaning they can follow, and remember more creators.**_

 _ **Meaning there will be a lot of terrible content.**_

 ** _Meaning if you have a deeper understanding of content and offer creation,
you will stand out and make 10x more than the other creators._**

As an example, Instagram recently put out a "reels bonus" to incentivize new
creators (because there is a demand for them).

I tested it out.

After 1 week I had 200K views on my reels.

They paid me $120.

This is what most creators will be happy with — relying on the platform to pay
them.

Since I have my own content and product ecosystem — in that same week, I made
$13,625 from free traffic on social media.

The new 1% of creators won't be the ones that go viral all the time.

It will be the ones that put Digital Economics into practice.

__

Join The 1%

There **would not** be saturation if there were 50% creators and 50% consumers
(creators are STILL consumers).

But, only 1% are creators.

And if history repeats itself, that number will stay FAR below 50%.

The opportunity is that high. You only realize this once you start.

Those that value consistency will win.

#  Intelligent Imitation  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

I am a big fan of EDM (electronic dance music), why?

Because there are hundreds (if not thousands) of genres and subgenres.

My favorite is bass music, which can be broken down into:

  * Dubstep
  * Riddim
  * Drum N Bass
  * Future bass
  * Melodic bass

The list can go on for another 20-30+ subgenres.

 _Why should you care?_

Because that’s exactly what the creator economy is.

Traditional music was limited by physical instruments.

Traditional business was limited by physical environment.

Digital music has no limits. We are creating new sounds which open up room for
entirely new and innovative music.

Not to mention how often the artists remix each other and completely change
the song.

People are attracted to the unique combination of sounds, synths, rhythm,
repetition, tone, and everything else that makes up a subgenre or “niche.”

When EDM producers go to create a song, they have a library of sounds,
textures, synths, plugins, and other things that allow them to be creative
with their production. They develop their unique sound over time.

I can’t get enough of Space Laces while others despise the screechy sounds he
produces.

Since I love and trust that his music will give me a specific feeling — I will
buy almost anything he creates outside of music (especially if it's something
I will use in my day-to-day life… be it information, a physical tool, gadget,
apparel, or anything else).

Even MORE bonus points if he creates a compelling argument as to why and how I
can implement it in my daily life.

As a content creator, it is your job to create, produce, and remix from a
database of content, quotes, anecdotes, metaphors, problems, benefits, topics,
ideas, words, and other things that will lead to you creating truly unique
content.

Over time, your voice develops.

Your “live shows” attract more fans.

You attract more opportunities from “record labels.”

People start talking about your “music.”

They eventually keep your “music” in a regular rotation. It becomes a part of
their life.

You spread your name by leveraging other people's listener base by doing
collaborations and sharing each other's creations.

This is what Intelligent Imitation is. Curating and developing an arsenal of
mental weapons to shoot your addictive creations out into the world.

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/29057772_1656420369s3iIntelligent_Imitation.png)

Throughout this module, we will be turning you into an EDM DJ — but for
content production instead of dance music.

You are speaking about what you learn through the lens of your vision, values,
mindset, experience, and expertise — that alone will attract the right people
to you.

If you want to read the original Intelligent Imitation article and the theory
behind it, [here it is.](https://thedankoe.com/how-to-copy-your-way-to-
success-instead-of-mediocrity/)

 **Cornerstone Curiosity — Don't Consume, Research.**

 **I can guarantee one thing:**

If you aren’t consuming (or “researching”) quality information, you aren’t
producing quality information.

That is the underlying problem of most engagement, writer's block, and
creative problems.

Cars need the right fuel to operate correctly.

Your job is to become an Epistemic Researcher.

In other words, a knowledge researcher.

The first step is pursuing your curiosity (your Domain Of Mastery should allow
room for pursuing your curiosity within the depths of those interest areas.
They run deeper than you think. Each interest is an iceberg that connect with
everything else).

While diving deep into this Interest Iceberg, you will be taking note of
ideas, content, inspiration, and anything else that can apply to a project you
are working on.

These “projects” are:

  * Your weekly newsletter outline
  * Your content as a whole (noting content ideas)
  * Anything relating to the Creator Command Center (relating to your vision, life’s work, values, etc)

Everything you are developing in your life is a project (you can think of it
as a science project).

Everything you consume (or research) now has practical application. Which
areas of your life can it apply to? You will only know this if you are
intentional when improving your personal and professional life — life itself
is inspiration.

This will be dependent on what works best for you — so again… you need to
treat this as a project itself.

Create a consumption habit and routine for yourself, observe problems that
come up, experiment with new ways of doing it, and slowly create a system you
can stick with.

We will talk about creating a content synthesis system in the next section.

For now, understand that you **MUST be curious** about what you are consuming.

 _ **Read things that make it hard to keep your mouth shut. You should feel
compelled to take notes and talk about it with those select few people that
“get you” (your eventual audience).**_

If what you are reading is boring and not sparking excitement in you — your
content will be boring and not spark excitement in others.

Even if you want to post about business, you will write better business
content when _whatever_ you are researching gives you inspiration and energy.
Even if its something as “unrelated” as web development.

 **(Hint: it’s still related. Everything is and can be used as firepower for
stories, metaphors, analogies, etc — like how I talked about EDM above to
bring a unique angle to this post.)**

I will often cycle through different audiobooks, physical books, summaries,
YouTube lectures, and everything else based on what I _feel_ will interest me
at the time.

This may seem counter-intuitive. Don’t question it yet. Try it out and tell me
it doesn’t increase the impact and energy of your content (relating to ANY
topic).

Pursue your curiosity.

__

Don't Know What To Consume?

Start with your favorite book.

I guarantee the second time you read it you will get new insights, ideas, and
be able to make more out of it with this process.

**Writing Down High-Signal Information**

We are finally getting to the good stuff.

“The Queue” inside your Notion Command Center is where ALL of the magic
begins.

This is where ideas with high potential energy are stored before they are
moved to anywhere else in your Command Center.

For this module, we are focused on content ideas.

When content ideas are put in The Queue, we need to run them through a process
to dissect them, develop them, store them, and start creating a database of
Genius Ideas we can pull from through our creative endeavors.

This entire process is how you actualize your life’s work in a fun, unique,
and impactful way.

 **When you are researching information that interests you, look for:**

  * Words and better vocabulary
  * Examples and metaphors
  * Stories or anecdotes
  * Ideas and concepts
  * Interesting facts
  * Advice that hits just right
  * Novel perspectives
  * “Aha!” moments that give you clarity

It doesn’t matter what you read.

Most of the time, the inspiration you need comes from a random string of words
that sparks the right idea in your head.

This brings up 2 important points:

  *  **You need a project to apply your learning to** — otherwise, you won’t pick up on random information that has the potential to apply to the project you are working on. A project can be as simple as a tweet in this case.
  *  **You need to consume information from a congruent voice** — you won’t read or listen intently if you aren’t interested in it. You will miss crucial pieces of information that could be woven into your newsletters, tweets, or content in general as new perspectives.

It’s less about _what_ you consume and more about _who_ you consume it from.
Do you understand what you are listening to? Is it challenging your
understanding and potentially kicking you into flow?

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/29057836_1656420695zmbFlow_Channel.png)

 **What you are reading should have a balance of challenge and skill to make
your brain light up with ideas and potential connections.**

This alone shows that it doesn’t matter what you are consuming, as long as you
are curious.

Consuming something that makes little sense to you will close your mind off to
potential connections and make it difficult to formulate novel perspectives.

If I study spirituality, but I am writing an article on business, a lot can
transfer over.

If what I am reading says “Stop worrying about the future, focus on the
present” (as a bad example).

I can use that in a business article about creating content. I can introduce
the source I got it from, start to write a story, and help people “stop
worrying about how well their content will do, focus on writing highly
impactful content.”

Another example:

I am listening to The Social Matrix by Actualized.org right now.

I LOVE these kinds of visionary concepts. They make my brain light up with
excitement and make me want to put the ideas to use.

Leo (the creator) paints a picture of society as a whole and how it is
interconnected.

I want to apply this concept to the creator economy… how there is a “school
system,” government, indoctrination process, and more.

If you are a web developer — could you spin that concept to describe developer
culture? Maybe freelance culture?

ANY of the points that he brings up can be applied to any domain.

If you are talking about health — you could use his example of how the school
system raises people to have poor conditioned health views. If that was an
introduction to your newsletter, you would get your point across 10x quicker
than the next health account.

It’s about _applying what you learn to what you write._

It’s not about learning what to write itself.

This will continue to make sense as you experience it.

What can you start consuming right now?

Information related to the principles, mentors, or sub-topics of your
interests inside the Domain Of Mastery.

Once you have fully immersed yourself in that domain, you can start consuming
anything you want.

At that point, you are just generating building blocks and new perspectives to
attack your Domain Of Mastery from.

 _Let’s talk about where and how we research and capture information._

No, keep it

#  Action Steps & My Brand Journey  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Remove from
my favorites")

So far, we've learned:

  * How to manage your time and energy as a creator
  * What makes an effective _personal_ brand
  * How to create your own niche by prioritizing your interests
  * The first iteration of your life's work that you will actualize with the power of social media
  * Nuances to creating a profile that attracts the right followers

In the next module, we will be diving deep into content creation. That's where
the real fun begins. Until then, here are some lever-moving actions that you
should be adding to your to-do list every day.

 **Lever Moving Actions**

 **1) Create the first iteration of your profile.**

Create a clickable profile picture, welcoming bio, and header image that puts
off the vibe you want.

You can always go back through the previous modules as you are doing this.

 **2) Study your mentors and try to emulate their content style.**

You can download the [Twemex](https://twemex.app/) twitter extension to view
certain accounts' top tweets. You can also use
[TweetHunter](https://thedankoe.com/get/tweethunter) for the same features and
be able to schedule your tweets.

Study them and try to recreate your own content from those.

 _Start posting at least 1 tweet a day._

Eventually, you will work up to 3-5 a day. I am currently posting 3.

Don't worry about optimal post times just yet.

Anything between 5am and 2pm ET seems to work just fine.

If you have a lot of content ideas, feel free to go scorched earth for the
sake of practicing your content writing.

 **3) Outline a newsletter based on the interest you want to build authority
in.**

This can stem from a lead-magnet outline — or it can serve as a way of
generating content and thread ideas.

You can start now (which I would recommend) or wait until we go over the long-
form writing framework.

If you'd like, write this newsletter as a Twitter thread first and use the
Non-Needy Networking process to have larger accounts retweet it — meaning you
will grow faster.

That thread can always be sent as a newsletter down the road. Likewise with
newsletters, they can always be turned into threads later on.

It is NOT a waste to start writing long-form content now. You can reuse those
ideas forever and build on top of those thoughts.

 **4) Start adding value to other accounts by engaging with and DMing them to
build connections.**

When you are replying to accounts — add on to the thought. Don't just reword
or reiterate what they said.

Talk about a problem you had relating to that problem and what solved it for
you.

This can also help spark content ideas of your own. Do you have a different
perspective or application of their content?

 _Start blocking off 15-30 minutes to engage with at least 10 accounts a day._

 _While you are at it, DM 1 of those accounts per day using the Non-Needy
Networking._

All of these can and should be added to the Daily Focus section of your Notion
dashboard.

 **The Evolution Of My Brand**

Most people only see the polished product of my brand.

I've built:

  * 10+ lead magnets
  * 2 ebooks
  * 3 courses
  * 1 community (with hundreds of articles and trainings)
  * Sold 2 different freelancing service
  * Sold 3 different consulting offers
  * I've changed my bio 100+ times
  * I've changed my header image 20+ times
  * I've written 10s of thousands of tweets
  * Sent 100+ emails
  * Built funnels for all of my products and lead magnets

Every one was better than the next.

 **My best advice has and will always be:** publish as fast as you possibly
can and iterate from there. You can start over and pivot whenever you please.

You don't see the steps I took and that can be intimidating. I want to go over
my brand evolution in the video below.

#  Skills, Expertise, & Curiosities  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my
favorites")

The effectiveness of your brand, content, and offers are a combination of 3
things:

  * Your skills
  * Your expertise
  * Your curiosities

Your skill level determines the quality of the value you deliver, your
curiosities give you a unique perspective on certain topics, and your
expertise allows you to monetize the attention you are grabbing.

In the first Digital Economics module we streamline this to create your Niche
Of One, discover your life's work, and create and impactful content strategy
that sells your products for you.

For now, I want to plant some seeds of awareness in your head.

As you go through this course, I would highly recommend _starting_ to read up
on the basics, principles, and fundamentals of certain skills.

You will not master these all in one go, but simply having the awareness of
them will prime your brain for pattern recognition.

Building a personal brand on social media gives you a place to practice ALL of
these skills.

This is crucial.

Rather than endlessly learning and not knowing how to apply your skills — you
can start applying what you learn immediately through your content, free
products, and brand.

 **Skills That Will Determine Your Success**

Fortunately — building a full-fledged personal brand or creator business
requires you to learn all of the skills that are necessary for success online.

Don't let this overwhelm you. You don't need all of these at the start. You
can learn and implement these whenever you see fit.

 **The beauty in this:** you have a meaningful project to work on, refine, and
iterate for as long as you do this.

Pursuing an intrinsic hierarchy of goals is a big key to happiness. It is how
you reap the benefits of the good dopamine that comes from survival mechanisms
in your brain.

Like working on a hobby project that you deeply care about as opposed to a
client project that you grow tired of.

> The mark of a person who is in control of consciousness is the ability to
> focus attention at will, to be oblivious to distractions, to concentrate for
> as long as it takes to achieve a goal, and not longer. And the person who
> can do this usually enjoys the normal course of everyday life. — Mihaly
> Csikszentmihalyi

  

 **Here are the skills that will boost the impact and income from your online
endeavors:**

  * Copywriting (persuasive writing)
  * Email marketing (for trust-building and sales)
  * Sales (for closing deals and networking properly)
  * Web design (for landing pages and a personal website)
  * Social media growth (for sending traffic and audience building)
  * Graphic design (for visuals and brand assets)
  * Marketing & advertising (for getting people to act)

Throughout Digital Economics, we will be learning all of these in a
streamlined — low-stress — manner.

 _You learn these skills best by learning the principles, starting a real
world project (a personal brand), and refining your skills with time and
experience._

These can all be freelanced or consulted with once you get the hand of them
(and if you want to go that route).

The more you practice these and get results for yourself — the more you
understand the nuance of how these skills interact with a specific business.

That is how you develop your own unique system and increase your prices IF you
want to freelance or consult with these down the road.

 **ALL of these skills rely on a set of meta-skills:**

  * Grabbing and holding attention
  * Storytelling & persuasion
  * Psychology & human behavior
  * Self-awareness and observation
  * Philosophy and spirituality

In other words, you need to understand how humans make sense of and interpret
what they see.

You need to understand different perspectives and viewpoints so you can
navigate topics with expertise.

You need to structure your message (throughout your entire brand, content, and
funnel) in a way that leads readers toward a beneficial desired outcome.

None of this will work if you create what you _think_ will help others VS what
is actually going to help others.

__

Specific Knowledge

You don't _have_ to do all of these things yourself. You can outsource them.

But, the process of "figuring it out" is how you acquire specific knowledge.
That is how you make new discoveries and help others navigate the path
effectively.

**How Your Curiosities Play A Role**

One big problem I see all the time is that people don't know how to talk about
what they love (while still maintaining authority).

It's pretty simple, you just have to zoom out.

Stop thinking of your content or brand as a static thing from day to day.

It grows and evolves over time. Your content doesn't just disappear after you
write it. You refine your ideas, post them again, and build a library that
displays your authority, interests, and personality.

Some content will stick in people's heads and do well — some content won't.
That's how it goes.

You incorporate your curiosities by being observant and using them to bring a
new perspective to a problem that people face.

Your curiosities intersect with your interests, skills, and expertise — _if
and only if you are trying to find a way to connect them._

 **Here is a general way to incorporate your curiosities into your brand:**

  * Write out 2-3 of your interests (the things you LOVE talking about)
  * Write out 2-3 options for eventual monetization (skills or interests like health or performance coaching)
  * Think big and small — write out broader interests and skills, then write out niche interests and skill relating to the 2-3 points you wrote out already. This starts to create a web of content ideas and curiosities to pursue
  * Keep an eye out for books, content, podcasts, and life experiences that check one of those boxes
  * Make a note of it and create some form of content around it

This is a watered-down version of the system we will be implementing in the
Bachelors tier to make this process seamless.

__

You Are Building A Personal Brand

Niche brands have their place, but this is for people that want to harness the
internet to do what they love (and pursue their life's work).

It is difficult to put YOU in a box — if not impossible. You are ALLOWED to
try different things and pivot whenever you want. You are a human that evolves
with time.

Why would that be any different in a digital reality?

With practice and busting through limiting beliefs, this will become a
reality.

**Solving Your Own Problems And Selling The Solution**

If you don't yet have a solidified offer to sell — or a skill that you are
hell-bent on monetizing — there is another route you can go.

This route is an all-in-one "one-person" business model approach.

You are leveraging your ability to solve your own problems, document the
process via content, and create a product that you can sell to your former
self.

This is:

  * Personal growth
  * Social media growth
  * Authority building
  * Market research
  * Marketing
  * Offer creation

All. In. One.

If you attract people with similar interests as you, educate them, and give
them a process that shaves 2-3 years off of their learning time — they will
pay you.

 **For example:** I have been passionate about health for the entirety of my
adult life.

I have 10 years of experience.

I've tried all of the diets, training programs, and everything else. I have a
very unique perspective with results to show for it.

Even though I talk about business and self-improvement — I could sell 6
figures worth of a health product in a month or two.

(Of course, this is considering I have an audience and vast marketing
knowledge).

My point is — my audience likes me for me. Everyone has burning biological
problems in the eternal markets. I can create a product on anything I feel
like IF I can position it correctly within those markets.

My personal brand is what sets me apart. People will buy my health product
over someone else's just because I'm the one that made them aware of their
problem and educated them on how to overcome it through my content.

__

The Best Products

The best products solve a problem that impacts a specific person's direct
experience in a positive way.

By solving your own problems, you do this automatically (and in a unique way).

This makes it seamless to target a problem in the eternal markets and position
it towards a beginner market. Nearly guaranteed sales if you understand the
rest of Digital Economics 101 on an experiential level.

#  Leave A Review  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

Throughout the Bachelors curriculum and Digital Economics 101 we went over:

1) An overview of the digital economy and how your skills, interests, and
expertise play a role.

2) The fundamentals of persuasive content that results in growth and
authority.

3) The best products and services you can sell with little to no experience.

4) How to turn the pursuit of your life's work into a leverageable online
brand.

5) How to write compelling tweets and threads based on your areas of interest.

6) How to capture, develop, and store ideas as "building blocks" for your
content.

7) How to write long-form newsletters that allow you to talk about whatever
you want on socials.

8) The 3-point content ecosystem to have a continuous stream of leads, product
sales, and audience nurturing.

9) How to use your writing as a simple foundation for branching out to all
other platforms.

I missed some steps there, but we went over a lot!

If you got value out of the Bachelors curriculum, it would be deeply
appreciated if you left a review below.

#  The 3 Point Content Ecosystem  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my
favorites")

As the creator economy continues to grow — those that can ruthlessly dissect
their Domain Of Mastery and be prolific with their words will rise to the top.

There has been a shift over the past few years.

Lambos, mansions, and other lifestyle flexes have started to fade away.

Articulation, mastery, and trust have started to fade in. People can see
through the facades and search for a sense of authenticity before forming that
deeper connection (like purchasing from you).

No longer can you rely on only short-form content if you want to make an
impact on this world — you have to attack from all angles.

Long-form, medium-form, and short-form.

Long-form prioritizes depth and authority:

  * Newsletters
  * Articles
  * Podcasts
  * YouTube videos
  * A book (when and if you want to)

 _All long-form content should have a call to action to purchase a product
from you (with other newsletter issues and products linked throughout the
newsletter)._

Medium-form is a mixture of depth and rapid growth:

  * Threads
  * Carousels
  * Instagram captions
  * Full-length LinkedIn posts
  * Clipped videos

 _All medium-form content should have a call to action at the bottom. Either a
link to your newsletter or lead magnet as a comment — or directions telling
them where to find that newsletter or lead magnet (because you can’t post
links in places like an Instagram caption)._

Short-form allows you to test ideas and build an audience:

  * Tweets
  * IG posts & stories
  * Reels & TikToks
  * Shorter LinkedIn posts

 _If a tweet performs well, you can plug your newsletter or lead magnet as a
reply to that tweet (I would only promote once a day for short-form content)._

All serve their unique purpose but also interconnect.

My job over this module is to give you a simple system to start implementing
and leverage for rapid growth. In the next module, we will start developing
your unique voice. In the last module, we will discuss branching out to new
platforms once your ideas are validated and your content quality is high.

During this module, we will understand the nuances, psychology, and structure
for each of these content styles — then begin streamlining our content
creation so it doesn’t take all of your time to hit all of these areas.

By putting an emphasis on long-form content and trust-building — this gives us
room to talk about whatever we want.

Medium and short-form content will be made for the purpose of growth and
attracting a broad spectrum of people that have similar interests as you.

This will allow us to build an audience quick, encourage them to dive into
your long-form content, and then that is where you can sell your products or
services without seeming like a timeline spammer or “overly salesy.”

This simple 3-point content ecosystem will give you a great foundation while
you focus on growing on one platform — in this case, Twitter (but can be
applied to all platforms).

 **Point 1) High-Quality Newsletter**

I didn’t understand the power of a newsletter until I was able to fit into my
content flow. It was a low priority of mine for the longest time.

Now, it is the pillar that the rest of my content banks on. If my newsletter
sucks (or goes unwritten) then all of my other content suffers.

This is both liberating and pressuring.

Liberating because you can spend an entire week munching and dissecting one
topic to create an amazing newsletter.

Pressuring because the rest of your medium and possibly short-form content
bank on it (I wouldn’t worry too much about this, you can skip a week or two
if you need to).

What makes the newsletter so valuable?

  *  **You can link your products, services, and other backlogged newsletters that live online 24/7** — these are like mini sales pages that you can promote at anytime (and they aren’t SEEN as sales pages, so more people will be happy to click through and read the entire article).
  *  **You own the CSV files of emails that you can download and transfer at anytime. You can’t download your followers** — if you get banned, you’re screwed. Newsletters offer protection.
  *  **Most newsletters suck.** If you can bring a fresh perspective to peoples inbox every week, you will have dedicated fans that nobody else on social media can compete with.
  *  **By writing a newsletter each week, you develop your ideas 10x more than the guy that is only posting short and medium-form content** — your ideas will start to stick in peoples heads and your ideas will spill into your shorter content.
  * You can use the newsletter as a YouTube script, podcast script, medium-form content inspiration, and short-form content inspiration to attack all angles of an idea and solidify it into your followers heads (this is how they will remember you).

The key to all of this: the newsletters have to be backlogged somewhere. You
have to be able to plug them under relevant tweets and posts.

ALL of your short and medium-form content will lead to a previous newsletter
issue or lead magnet.

If the tweet or thread topic is related to a previous newsletter subject, link
that newsletter.

If the tweet or thread topic is not related, link your lead magnet.

(If you are running a promotion, launching a product, or something that
demands a higher priority — then you will stop plugging your newsletter for a
bit for the sake of the promotion)

This is why I mainly recommend Revue or Substack for beginners.

Revue has an integration with Twitter, so you can advertise it on your profile
to add some social proof and get some subscribers here and there.

If you want to checkout Substack and see if it’s a better fit, be my guest.

Both Revue and Substack backlog your newsletters for you. Then you can just
grab the link and promote it.

Again, don’t stress picking the right newsletter platform. You can always
download and transfer the emails to another provider later on (it would only
take about 15-30 minutes to do so, no big deal).

As you build your list over time — your newsletter subscribers will build a
deeper connection with you and consistently be exposed to your products and
services in a non-salesy way.

 **If this doesn’t make sense yet, give it time, this is only an introduction
to the importance of your newsletter — we have much more to cover that will
make writing your newsletter seamless.**

 _Don't expect to be able to run (newsletter) when you haven't learned how to
walk (tweet)._

__

What If I Don't Have A Product?

Don’t stress it. You can either create a basic consulting package or just
focus on building your list for when the time comes. The bigger and better
quality the list — the more sales you will make when its time to promote.

**Point 2) Condensed Thread**

When written with quality, your newsletter can be condensed into 1-2 medium
form content pieces — in the case of Twitter as our foundation, threads are
the medium form content.

You can take the main ideas from your newsletter, outline the thread, and fill
it in with speed. By doing it this specific way, you can end up with a
completely different piece of content that performs well on Twitter.

Keep in mind: this is optional. You don't have to use your newsletter for
thread ideas, but it is there if you need them. [You can always use the main
idea generation method we talked about in the last
module.](https://portal.digitaleconomics.school/login/post/229)

Medium-form content like threads are important for:

  * Driving massive traffic to your products or newsletter
  * Having more potential virality and reach
  * Building authority quicker than only short-form content
  * Bringing in more followers because you are holding there attention longer (meaning you are giving them more reasons to engage and follow)

At the end of your threads, you will be plugging the relevant newsletter or
your lead magnet.

Our goal is to send as much traffic as we can to our “mini salesman” as
possible.

This leads to an email list that we own and exposure to our deeper ideas (that
include nuance that short or medium-form content allow for).

So far, we are growing an audience on Twitter through well written tweets and
threads — while plugging a relevant newsletter or lead magnet every single
day.

Over time this will build leverage that other accounts can only dream of.

__

Making Sense On Its Own

There are subtle nuances we will dive into, but when you write a thread — try
to make every tweet of the thread make sense on its own.

This will keep readers engaged, make it easy to turn the ideas into tweets,
and is easily repostable as an Instagram carousel or other form of medium-form
content.

**Point 3) High Performing Tweets**

Learning to write short-form content — like tweets — will only enhance the
impact of your long and medium-form content.

It will help you hold attention, add a punch to your paragraphs, and the main
bonus:

Allow you to keep short-form writing in mind when you are writing your long-
form content.

When you are conscious and intentional with the purpose of your newsletter (to
be both quality and have room for repurposing / condensing) you become an idea
generation machine.

You can crack ideas for tweets AS you are writing the newsletter, structure
and schedule those tweets immediately, and include them in your newsletter
writing.

When these tweets publish, you can seamlessly plug your newsletter and send
more traffic to it.

With all of this taken into account — you begin to attack 1 topic per week
from all angles.

Like music, repetition, rhythm, and remixing is important for speaking to all
aspects of the audience you are building.

 **Think of this as art. You are an EDM DJ for Twitter.**

Every week, you can feel confident that your ideas are sticking in your
audience's mind (making them remember you) and make them want to come back for
more.

__

This Is Not A Set Structure

This is a great way to write all of your content in one, but you will also be
posting standalone tweets to generate and validate more ideas. We will discuss
this in the next section when we talk about a replicable system for quick
growth.

Wait until the end of this module to start creating a weekly content flow.

#  Pieces Of A Personal Brand  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my
favorites")

Traditional brands are boring, static, and slowly losing trust from the
general population.

People crave human connection and authenticity now more than ever.

Tell me, who would you rather buy from?

The best-selling generic amazon cutting board?

Or a hand-crafted cutting board from someone you follow online and whose
content you can't get enough of?

If money isn't an issue and you are genuinely interested in buying a cutting
board — you will be happy paying a premium for the story that the cutting
board holds.

This is a weird example, but it stands true for everything.

Would you rather buy ground beef from mass production sold at a store?

Or buy from your local farmer? Or the dude who runs a farm that has a personal
brand? Even Butcher Box is more intimate than the meat you pick up at the
store.

 _Intimacy, depth, and personality is what gives you a competitive edge over
companies with 100's of employees and billions of dollars to throw around._

 **Creating A Customer Avatar With Ease**

In traditional branding, people create a customer avatar in order to
understand _who_ they are creating content, products, and marketing strategies
for.

You can find templates for these online (which are worth filling out,
especially when it comes to marketing a product — which we will do in the
Master's curriculum).

Most of those templates ask questions like their age, interests, other
demographics, where they can be found hanging out online, their favorite
quotes, and other things that help you understand that person.

The most important aspect of a buyer persona is a list of problems that keep
them up at night.

For personal branding, your customer avatar is you.

The problems you are solving with your content and products are your problems.

By getting in touch with yourself and cultivating self-awareness, you have all
of the marketing firepower you need (if you aren't overthinking things).

With a personal brand, **you are attracting people that vibe with your
message, interests, and expertise** (while still persuading them that those
things are important in terms of their quality of life).

 **A strong personal brand is the best USP** (unique selling proposition) and
is what will have people buying from you over a competitor (among other
things, of course).

If you are selling a product or service to someone specific (like web design
to local businesses) then yes, you will have to create a separate customer
avatar to market effectively towards that person.

Yes, you can have multiple customer avatars that you want to target.

Yes, you can have a personal brand based on _you_ as the customer avatar while
selling something for another customer avatar. Brand and advertising can be
separate.

The good thing is that there is a website that will generate _your_ customer
avatar for you and help you understand yourself on a deeper level.

[ **Take the MBTI personality test here.**](https://www.mbtionline.com/)

This test will give you a deeper understanding of yourself, help you become
aware of your problems, and give you ample firepower for _who you are writing
content for._

__

Attract The People You Can Help The Most

The people that you can help the most are ones that have similar interests and
goals. You will be the one that exposes them to other related interests and
goals.

Your content (and potentially your products) should all target this specific
person's problems and aspirations.

**The Key To Building A Leverageable Brand**

I want you to start thinking of your brand on a longer time scale.

1 tweet does not display the depth behind your brand.

1 newsletter does not display the depth behind your brand.

Neither do a week of tweets or a month of newsletters.

 **Your content over a 6-12 month timeframe is what determines your followers'
perception of you.**

It is very rare for somebody to go from non-follower to die-hard fan in
anything less than a month.

During those 6-12 months, we need to be sure we touch on 3 pillars for what I
call Social Leverage.​​​​​​​

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28734217_1655126401NW4Social_Leverage.png)

If you have high social leverage (you are covering all 3 bases) then you will
open yourself up to more opportunities.

A brand with high social leverage is noticeable.

I would like to think that my social leverage score is high.

I can DM almost anyone and immediately be taken seriously.

I can close more clients because of how they perceive me. I can get on big
podcasts just by asking. I can use my leverage on Twitter to exchange value
with someone who has leverage on Instagram and have them help me grow. Same
goes with LinkedIn or any other platform.

Once you build social leverage on one platform (like Twitter) you can transfer
it over to others 10x easier. All you have to do is reach out to someone on
that platform, tell them you have X amount of followers and useful strategies,
and they'll help you grow.

Plus, you'll already have validated content ideas that you can transfer over
and use to grow quickly.

The list of benefits goes on and on.

Of course, it will take time to build this leverage as a beginner — but it
helps to zoom out and view it from a point of long-term leverage over the
perspective of short-term money or virality.

An account that only focuses on one of these pillars (like a quotes account,
theme account, meme account, or super niche account based on one skill) will
not have these same opportunities. They will more than likely be ignored in
the DMs are struggle to make an income for themselves.

(There are caveats to all of this, super niche accounts can make good money,
but do they enjoy the entire process? Are they able to talk about things that
give them energy and fulfillment? Or do they have to stick to a script?)

If you only go deep into productivity as an example and don't talk about
yourself, your interests, or your accomplishments — **you won't have as much
leverage as the account that cultivates all 3 pillars of social leverage.**

The 3 pillars that need to be solidified in your brand over 6-12 months are
growth, authority, and authenticity.

 **1) Growth**

It should be obvious that if your brand isn't growing (in followers or
newsletter subscribers) something needs to change in your strategy.

There is _always_ something you can do to grow faster (you just may not have
the specific knowledge to do so yet and need more practice).

The main thing that will determine growth is your content and top-of-funnel
socials (like Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn).

  * Is your content being shared?
  * Will your content make people **click on your profile** and wonder "Who is this guy?"
  * Is your content polarizing due to speaking with confidence on the subject at hand?

Other brand touchpoints play a role in this as well. Optimizing for growth in
your content, profile, and replies will do you well. We will be doing this
over the coming sections.

If you aren't growing, you may need to play to the algorithm a bit more. Study
what kind of content is doing well, incorporate that into some of your tweets,
and be sure it is getting shared by your connections (I will show you how to
leverage other accounts and grow fast when we discuss content).

 **2) Authority**

Authority comes down to 2 things: **depth and social proof.**

 **Depth** = a deep understanding of one area of interest where you can create
unique perspectives and compelling arguments for specific problems.

 **Social proof** = credentials, titles, niche accomplishments, testimonials,
and other things that display your authority in a space.

When you are just starting out, you won't have much authority. This is fine.
Your job will to be establish authority fast.

 **3) Authenticity**

Authenticity comes from:

  * Documenting projects that you are working on. Everything is a project if you want it to be. Your mental, physical, spiritual, and financial development can all be spun into lessons for those that are 2-3 steps behind you.
  * Expressing opinions, likes, and dislikes to relate with those in your audience
  * Being vulnerable — but not in a pitiful way. Be vulnerable by talking about your losses and what you plan to do differently.

All of these should naturally fall into place over time. Everything you learn
in this course are built around those pillars.

__

All Of These Intersect

If you are just starting out — or have yet to establish authority — that will
be the first thing you focus on. A mixture of growth and authority is a great
place to focus for beginners.

Once you've established authority you can easily pivot (since the content and
other free information you've created to build that authority will be up
forever).

**Other Aspects Of A Compelling Brand**

Here are a few other things I want you to keep in mind while creating your
brand.

As you are creating all of these, be sure to emulate the profile pictures and
overall branding of the accounts you aspire to be like (we will write these
down in the next module).

 **1) Visual Storytelling**

Have you ever come across a social media account and you instantly hold them
in high regard? It's because of their branding, visuals, and vibe they are
putting off.

  * Is their profile picture giving off warmth? Confidence? Is it welcoming? Intimidating? Feminine? Masculine?
  * What colors are they using? What emotions do those colors represent?
  * Start studying people's accounts from both the written and visual perspective — how does their branding make you _feel_?

Colors and image composition should always be taken into account when creating
your profile picture, header images, and other brand assets.

All of those should reflect the mood, tone, and "vibe" you are trying to give
off.

If you want to self-educate as you build your first project (your profile)
here are some resources.

[Color theory](https://webflow.com/blog/color-theory) — to understand and
create your own color palette.

[Choosing a brand font ](https://venngage.com/blog/brand-fonts/)— to choose a
font that resonates with your audience.

[Design principles](https://99designs.com/blog/tips/principles-of-design/) –
to understand what makes visual designs pop.

[Image composition](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-
solutions/11-thoughts-introduction-photographic-
composition#:~:text=Elements%20of%20composition%20are%3A%20patterns,that%20works%20for%20your%20image.)
— so you can direct attention with your visuals.

[Profile picture composition](https://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/perfect-profile-
pictures-9-tips-plus-some-research/) — to create a profile picture that gives
off the vibe you want.

[How to take a headshot with your phone](https://headshots-inc.com/blog/how-
to-take-professional-headshots-at-home/) — to understand lighting and making
due with what you have.

From those, you can research how to edit the style that you want to.

 **Side note:** most of those resources talk about traditional branding. With
a personal brand, you can usually get away with choosing colors and fonts that
_you_ vibe the most with. As you are attracting people that have similar
interests as you.

I have always been a fan of black, white, a neon color, and the Montserrat
font — so I exclusively use those for my brand and people associate those with
me.

How are you capturing and directing attention with your visuals?

Understanding this will also help you understand why certain Tweets are
structured in certain ways — they help guide the reader down the page to the
next step (like engagement or clicking a link).

Remember, this course is about implementing systems. All of the necessary
fundamentals you need to learn are available for free online (and they are
easy to find).

Start creating your profile and use the resources above to practice iterating
and making it better.

 **2) Your Hero's Journey**

Every great brand has a backstory.

You have a backstory (whether you know it or not).

You do not have to worry about this until later — but plant this seed in your
head.

If you want to connect with your audience on a deeper level, consistently
talking about your story is a great way to do that.

[Here's an example of mine.](https://thedankoe.com/i-failed-at-7-online-
business-models-and-turned-it-into-a-full-time-creative-income/)

 **3) A brand vision, mission, and goals.**

All great brands have a vision for how they want to impact the world (how they
are going to solve a big problem in the world.

I will save you the pain of reading about this as we will be writing this all
out in the coming sections.

__

Gain Every Advantage You Can

Most people that start on social media pay zero attention to their actual
brand. Most social media guides focus solely on content.

If you can create _depth_ behind your brand with everything we just talked
about — you gain a competitive advantage even over people with the best
content.

Delete for good?

No, keep it

#  Creating Fusion Content  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

As your database grows in size, complexity, and impact you can start to treat
your discoveries, theories, and processes as building blocks for your long-
form content.

All of the:

  * Examples
  * Stories
  * Metaphors
  * Big ideas
  * Quotes
  * References
  * Big problems and benefits
  * Discoveries
  * Concepts

Can be used as “drag and drop” pieces for your long-form content.

This is what completely changed the game for me in my content creation
process.

  * My newsletters immediately started getting more praise
  * My newsletters became fun to write
  * My YouTube videos became seamless to record using the newsletter as a script
  * My podcast episodes started to revolve around those big ideas and concepts
  * I could visualize these concepts and start having an incredibly unique content style

I want to revisit the APAG framework and the long-form writing template now
that we have more ideas to pull from.

#  Your First Tasks & How To Use  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my
favorites")

The best way to make use of this course is to get uncomfortable as fast as
possible. Throw yourself into the unknown, put out content you are nervous
about, and get used to taking your ideas seriously — that is how you start to
make connections fast.

Some of this course will be text-based, some video, and a lot of real-world
examples and walkthroughs.

My purpose with this is to get you to form the habits of a successful creator.
Going through this course will do absolutely nothing for you if you don't USE
what you learn.

The ancient Hermetics knew the importance of action when they coined The Law
Of Use.​​​​​​​

 **Fail Fast & Fail Early So This Course Makes Sense**

I am repeating myself from the last module of Digital Economics 101 because
this is important.

 _If you do not take these steps, you are wasting valuable information that
**you will teach yourself** by going through this course._

I want you to start your Twitter account and newsletter so you can fail fast
and early.

Not only will this help you **make connections with what you are learning in
this course** , but you will be able to look back and be awestruck by your
progress.

When we implement the Evergreen Content Ecosystem in later modules, our
newsletter will be the key in building authority, making an income, creating
content, and scheduling promotions.

Here are your action steps:

 **1) Sign up for a Twitter account**

If you already have a Twitter account, keep it, don't start a new one. The
more followers you have the easier it is to grow. The first 0-1000 followers
are the hardest because you don't have any social proof.

Use or create the most professional (or attention grabbing) profile picture
you have.

Write a bio of what you _think_ will work based on what you read in Digital
Economics 101.

Write your first tweet based on one thing you are deeply interested in or have
expertise in.

If you need inspiration for your first post, create a list-style tweet on how
to achieve a specific benefit of that interest or expertise.

Here's an example for my interest self-improvement:

> You need a method for diffusing your own bad attitude, something as simple
> as:  
>  
> \- Deep breathing  
> \- Going on a walk  
> \- Writing your thoughts  
>  
> It is too easy for somebody to grab your attention with the potential of
> pissing you off  
>  
> Stay aware and in control
>
> — DAN KOE (@thedankoe) [June 30,
> 2020](https://twitter.com/thedankoe/status/1277957339002417152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Notice how I talk about:

  * "Bad attitude"
  * "Pissing you off"
  * Staying in control

Pain points and benefits that make or break the engagement and relatability of
this tweet.

This tweet is an implied transformation story within itself.

If you want to take it even further — look at how your favorite Twitter
account writes content, take ONE of your bullet points from the other tweet,
and use that as a topic for your next tweet.

 _The more you struggle to write this, the better._

 **2) Take a screenshot of your profile and first tweet and save it in a safe
place**

Whenever you feel lost, refer to these images to zoom out and see how far you
have come.

I wish I took a screenshot when I first started my account.

 **3) Brainstorm a newsletter idea**

Your newsletter will play a major role in the content ecosystem we will
implement.

At this point in time, sign up for a [Beehiiv](https://www.beehiiv.com/)
account (you can always change this down the road) and:

Pick a topic that you want to write on that is related to your interests or
expertise

Create an outline of the key points you want to touch on

Set it aside (don't write anything) and let ideas come to you over the next
week (be sure to write them down in The Queue inside the Notion dashboard.

If my reasoning behind this doesn't make sense yet, bare with me.

Embrace and become aware of whatever discomfort you face.

 _Even better, turn that discomfort into advice for yourself and post it as
content._

 **Now you have something to iterate on and tie your learnings back to** — you
will learn much faster this way.

 **4) Connect with 1 person**

Again, connections are an absolute must in this space.

We are very lucky to be living in these times.

> Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and
> products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media). — Naval

Social capital = how many people you have access to — a big part of building
leverage.

  * DM people that you meet in the cohort
  * DM people that have more, less, and equal followers as you
  * DM people that you are genuinely interested in and would want to work with.

[Check out this thread if you are unsure what to send as a
DM.](https://twitter.com/thedankoe/status/1534877477620879362)

 **Tips For Using This Course**

 **1) Act, Then Ask**

There are no stupid questions, but you are doing yourself a disservice if you
ask a vague, Googleable question before you even start.

Start first, hit a wall, and ask a specific question related to that problem.
This will give you a much more valuable answer.

You can ask these specific questions to the people you are strategizing with
or inside [Modern Mastery](https://modernmastery.co/letter).

 **2) Take notes**

Taking notes shows me that you are serious about learning all of the material
in this course.

If you want to incorporate business, branding, content, social media, or
anything else we teach here into your brand — be my guest!

Take notes and teach what you are learning via your content.

Just remember, don't make promises or flex results that you don't have.
Position what you are teaching in a way that shows you are still learning.

 **Example** : you could write a thread on "5 lessons I learned about building
an authoritative brand this week."

 **Study — practice — teach.**

 **3) Implement Immediately**

This course is structured in a way where you build along with it.

Every aspect of this course is action-oriented.

AS you learn, apply what you learn.

Once you hit a wall or need clarification — go back through the teachings,
search for information online, and ask specific questions where you can.
