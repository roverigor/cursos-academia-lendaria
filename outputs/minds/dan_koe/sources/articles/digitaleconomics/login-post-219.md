#  Your Domain Of Mastery  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

There is one thing that creators stress over _all the time._

 **Choosing a niche.**

I want you to eradicate the word "niche" from your psyche right now.

Constantly exposing yourself to content telling you to niche down will only
make you live in a stressed-out state.

It is difficult to put **You** in a box, but you can **choose which areas of
interest and expertise to prioritize** at specific points in your journey.

The main thing you should be focusing on is:

  1. Having an interest that makes you money
  2. Having interests that you love talking about and researching
  3. Talking about those skills and interests in a way that attracts like-minded people at different levels of awareness (by talking about related interests.)

Those 3 things will be prioritized based on which phase of your journey you
are in.

Here is my process for creating your niche of one:

 **Your Domain Of Mastery**

Don't think of this from a niche perspective, think of it from a mastery
perspective.

The internet has opened up the opportunity to become an expert in multiple
domains — each one complimenting and providing context to the next.

We are in another renaissance era where polymaths, autodidacts, and artists
can thrive due to the streamlined information and abundance of ideas that are
out in the world.

To start this process off, write down 3 interests:

  *  **One that has the potential to make you money** — like a marketable skill, coaching offer, or anything that you have seen others talking about and making a living off of online.
  *  **One that excites you when it is brought up in conversation** — this hints at passion and obsession which will transfer good energy to your audience.
  *  **One that compliments your other interests or you are curious about** — this will help you create unique, fusion-style perspectives like I do in my newsletter. You will start to realize that everything is connected.

Number 3 is variable and optional. This gives you the opportunity to learn,
teach, and gauge your interest in that subject — meaning you can try different
things and see what sticks.

Every single one of you will be choosing slightly different interests. This
alone is how you differentiate yourself.

Don't focus on niching your brand down — focus on the Domain Of Mastery
instead — then focus on niching your content and products down to solve
specific problems for your audience.

 **Remember** : the perception of your brand (your "niche") is determine by
your content over a 6-12 month span. Don't worry about getting it right just
yet.

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28742619_1655148023dm5Domain_Of_Mastery.png)

Now, this can get overwhelming, especially if you are a beginner that hasn't
established yourself in any specific interest.

See the areas where it labels the priorities?

The completely white circle is where your focus should be when you haven't
established authority in a specific domain.

Once you have established authority, you can work in the second interest, then
the third.​​​​​​​

 _ **The interests you choose should be broad at the start.**_

This gives you ample room to try everything and see what sticks.

That is the key to a lot of this — making a lot of noise and honing in on
signal according to feedback, engagement, and what you enjoy talking about.

__

Your Niche Is Determined By Your Priorities

The topics you talk about (and are known for) are determined by what you are
interested in _right now_ and whether or not you have established authority in
one area.

Know when you need to shift priorities when you are launching a product,
trying to land clients, and trying to maintain the 3 pillars of social
leverage.

Let's use the example of a broad interest — **online business**.

Now, you can break this interest down into:

​​​​​​​ **1) The principles, basics, or fundamentals you need to learn.**

A game isn't fun if you don't understand the rules.

If you don't understand the principles, you don't understand the topic.
Writing these down will give you a foundation for an evergreen newsletter,
video, article, or lead magnet that you can send people to time and time again
when they ask "How do I do X?"

This is how you start building authority in that area and start creating
unique perspectives revolving around those principles.

For online business, the principles are:

  * Create a product or service (physical or digital)
  * Learn marketing and sales to communicate its value
  * Send traffic to your product or service (social media, paid ads, referrals, etc)

That's about it, you can go deeper if you'd like.

Can you see how you can start educating people on this based on your current
perspective and situation? How do those principles apply to the online
business model you are pursuing?

 **2) Topics & sub-topics to expand our awareness of the space.**

Our job is to dive into the iceberg and networks of topics that our interest
presents. This is how we create depth and deepen our understanding of the
topic fast.

Attacking your interest from all angles is how you create depth and authority.

All of these can turn into multiple short-form content ideas and a series of
long-form content ideas.

  * Self-employment
    * ​​​​​​​Productivity
    * Focused work
    * Creating your niche
  * Client acquisition
    * ​​​​​​​How to DM
    * Qualifying
    * Service onboarding
  * Social media growth
    * ​​​​​​​Writing newsletters
    * Writing threads
    * The best types of content
  * ​​​​​​​Digital product creation
    * ​​​​​​​Marketing and offers
    * Launch strategy
    * Best platforms to build on

Can you see how certain sub-topics start to branch into domains outside of
online business? If you break things down enough, everything starts to
connect. This is why I keep saying it doesn't _really_ matter what you talk
about — because people will know what your expertise is based on other
content.

You can break these down all day and start to connect the dots.

ALL of these have problems that you can target and solve for yourself and
others.

 **3) Mentors to emulate from those topics.**

If you want validated content ideas and a business worth studying — follow the
people that have put in the time and effort to refine their ideas (and have
results to show for it).

I personally use [TweetHunter](https://thedankoe.com/get/tweethunter) and
[Twemex](https://twemex.app/) to write, schedule, and generate content ideas
from writers that I aspire to be like.

This is also a part of interest immersion. By following everyone that talks
about this subject, purchasing top-rated books on the subject, and exposing
yourself to information left and right — you become a member of that "niche."
Meaning that you have market research at your fingertips for when that time
comes.

 **4) Content ideas that are validated and will nearly guarantee engagement.**

From your topic breakdown and researching your mentors, you should have ample
ideas flooding your mind.

We will discuss viral content idea generation in a few sections when we
discuss growing as a beginner.

 **5) Real-world problems so you can create compelling content and product
angles.**

Now that you are immersed in that environment, you will be able to identify
others problems and your own problems.

You can create content around these to build authority or just note it down in
your command center to use as marketing firepower later on.

We have not talked about content creation yet, so don't get to ahead of
yourself here. However, ALL of these are content ideas. Everything you right
down here is for the sake of creating content that hits all 3 pillars of
social leverage.

Right now I want you to consider your interests and which one you will
establish authority in first.

 **How To Establish Authority Quick**

Again, authority comes from **depth** or **social proof**.

Most beginners don't have social proof to leverage, so you must double down on
depth.

Throughout this course, our focus will be on creating the most depth
imaginable — and social proof of course — but you don't want to rely on one or
the other. Leveraging both will bring you the most followers, clients, and
sales.

How do you create depth? By talking about all aspects of that interest and
educating people on what they need to know.

Whenever you plan to launch a product, run a promotion, pivot your brand, or
just start talking about a new interest, here's what you do:

  *  **Outline a lead magnet (free download in exchange for their email) that educates them to the point of understanding that topic** — this is usually beginner level and primes people to buy your product or service (this is how you _create_ your own customers... not just expect them to buy your products)
  *  **Dissect certain aspects of the topic in your newsletter** — you can either fill in the outline of your lead magnet by writing chapters of it as a newsletter, or just come up with content ideas and write about it.
  *  **Make it the 80/20 of your social media content** — 80% building authority and educating people from beginner to advanced on the topic at hand, 20% talking about your other interests.

The more you educate people on a specific topic, the more they will trust you
as the expert on the subject and pay you for your products or services.

 **Action Steps You Can Take Right Now**

1) Solidify the interest that you want to establish authority in. (You can
always change this, just commit to one for now)

2) Immerse yourself in that environment and study products and lead magnets
that are in that space.

3) Outline a free eBook, loom video, checklist, or other form of lead magnet
and focus on educating people that are at a beginner level.

4) Use the lead magnet outline to create newsletter content ideas — write
newsletters at your own pace (this will be easier when we discuss content
creation)

5) Use that newsletter as inspiration for content ideas and plug your
newsletter issues under it to gain email subscribers

6) Eventually, start promoting your lead magnet under social posts and in your
emails to lead people into purchasing your products or services.

This process will make more sense later in this course — but I wanted to plant
that seed of awareness in your head ;)

I've created 10+ lead magnets in my time here. This has always been a first
step to educating people on what I want to talk about so they are interested
in it.

This shouldn't be seen as overwhelming because the lead magnet forms the
foundation for your content. It is not a balancing act of both. It is about
putting effort into creating a high-quality lead magnet and creating content
_around_ that. 2 in 1.

 **The Mastery Method**

The Mastery Method will help you understand the domain you want to master. It
will also provide clarity on which interests you should prioritize first.

I would not give any less time than 1 month to pursue one specific interest.

Once you have an interest you want to pursue, again:

  * Outline a project (or lead magnet) related to that interest so you can learn with context.
  * Immerse yourself in environment of social accounts, books, blogs, podcasts, and the rest so you are inspired and content creation comes easy.
  * Evaluate and reflect on that specific interest and see if you want to keep that in your brand.

I was adamant on including health in my brand for the longest time. I recently
got rid of it because it wasn't helping. If I want to start talking about it
again, I can... I just have to attack that interest from all angles and
educate people on topics I want to talk about.

 **Bonus: Name Your Domain & Broaden Your Interests**

If you want to ease your worries about not being "niche" enough, here's what
you can do.

After helping people with this “Domain Of Mastery” concept before, the most
common questions are:

 _“What interests should I choose?”_

 _“What if my interests are too niche?”_

 _“What if people aren’t interested in them?”_

If you are interested in something, other people are. You aren’t that special
;)

For the other questions, these are refined with time.

If you feel like your interest is too niche or specific, broaden it a bit.
Move up a market stage (niche market, sub market, eternal market).

Instead of “email marketing” being your interest, make it “online business,”
“freelancing,” or “marketing.”

Why? We are aiming for building a large audience here, and you don’t want to
put yourself in a box too soon. You can still primarily talk about email
marketing, but you will get more readers and engagement when using email
marketing TO explain marketing concepts.

If you are interested in bodybuilding, broaden it to health or fitness.

If you are interested in meditation, broaden it to spirituality or mindset.

You want to give yourself ample room in terms of writing and audience growth.

Once you have your 3 interests that you plan to master, you can write about
anything related to those interests.

Naming Your Domain

If you want to eliminate even more competition, you can brainstorm a new name
for your domain as a whole.

As an example, if your interests are now broad and seemingly unrelated, like:

  * Marketing
  * Spirituality
  * Bodybuilding

One, I would argue that these all fall under self-improvement. But that is
boring and doesn't get the point across.

Can you create a new "niche" that others can identify with?

 _Bodybuilding + spirituality = Physical Spiritualist_

 _Bodybuilding + marketing = Financial Fitness_

 _Marketing + spirituality = Wealthy Monk or Zen Creation_

You don't have to include all 3, but you can.

This is optional. I would recommend sitting with it and coming up with one
that resonates with your soul. If it's the right name, you will know. If you
don't know, sit on it longer.

Brainstorm some of your own, contemplate it on a walk outside, and see what
your mind comes up with.

I've seen some great names for specific categories or Domains Of Mastery in
the past.

Mine could be summed up as **one-person businesses** and **lifestyle design**.

One-person businesses = marketing, coaching, and every other business interest
I want to talk about (without lacking niche-ness and specificity).

Lifestyle design = spirituality, mindset, self-improvement, and every other
aspect of life really.

I am not subscribed to any specific niche, but I am. Everything is connected
;)
