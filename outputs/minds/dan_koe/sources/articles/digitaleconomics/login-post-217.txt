Creating Clarity
Throughout the entirety of your online journey, you will be pursuing your own path and achieving things that other people will want to learn from you.
Every single one of you will be creating a unique path that gets you the results you want. That unique path is the most valuable information you can obtain (and eventually sell or teach).
Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you.
Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.
Specific knowledge can be taught through apprenticeships or self-taught. It's high paying because society has not yet figured out how to teach or automate it. It tends to be creative or technical. Build specific knowledge where you are “a natural.”
— Naval
Throughout this course, you will be apprenticing under me in a controlled environment. I am teaching you the specific knowledge I have acquired throughout my years of self-education.
I have built this course with specific knowledge in mind.
I can teach you what worked for me — but you will need to self-educate along the way.
If you want to understand this from a philosophical viewpoint —
I wrote an article on how to build a creative income.
​​​​​​​In that article we go over this image:
This is how you gain specific knowledge.
This is how you build creative systems that solve your audience's problems (that are worth a lot of money with a service business or digital product).
This is how you order consciousness in yourself and others (creating clarity and removing uncertainty).
The white dots are what you've experienced, failed, and gotten feedback on (how you create a system).
The black dots are what you haven't exposed yourself to, haven't learned about, or aren't able to tap into when building.
The white line that connects the dots is your way of solving a specific problem.
This solution is unique to you. Nobody can compete with it. You can either sell that solution or keep it to yourself for leveraging results.
Thinking back, this is how I gained over 120,000 followers in a week on Instagram.
The knowledge didn't come from a course. It came from depth, learning, and exposure to everything that would result in creating a system for consistent Instagram growth.
When you document your findings through your content online, you can come back and piece together a solution.
6 Steps To Acquiring Specific Knowledge & Building Creative Systems (That You Can Sell In The Future)
The traditional learning model sucks.
It teaches you to memorize what you learn, do homework, and eventually put those skills to use (and end up just being trained on how to do a specific job without using anything you learned).
Here is a better way to learn. A way that will arm you with specific knowledge.
This process is assuming that you understand the basics, principles, or fundamentals of whatever you are trying to execute on. If you have absolutely no idea where to start, refer back to
this module in Digital Economics 101.
1) Start and outline a personal project.
Do not start learning first.
You already know what project you need to start right now.
That project is your personal brand.
Creating an outline will make you aware of what you know (and what you don't know).
Why is this important?
Because you need to learn with context.
Don't just learn aimlessly without having something to apply your learnings to.
In relation to the visual above
— you are creating the outer circle that you can start to explore and learn about. This circle will represent your Domain Of Mastery that we will discuss soon.
2) Choose a related successful project to emulate.
There is somebody out there that has created what you want to create. That's why you want to create it in the first place... because you were exposed to it and know it's possible.
If I want to build a beautiful landing page, would I not research others for inspiration?
If I want to write an incredible tweet, would I not research high-performing tweets?
If I want to grow a personal brand, would I not research brands that are doing it right?
This goes for anything.
In relation to the visual
— this is how you gain clarity on the desired outcome you are trying to achieve.
3) Start the project with your current knowledge.
Do not learn first.
Start first.
When you have a clear outline and a project to emulate — your brain is primed to tie your life and business experiences to that specific project (making it easier to act from a place of inspiration).
In relation to the visual
— this is how you make your first step into the unknown and make the turn the first circle from black to white.
4) Immerse yourself in a conducive environment.
If your digital or physical environment is littered with distractions, you will get distracted.
If your digital or physical environment is filled with inspiration and relevant information — you will constantly be reminded
This alone will help you gain clarity WHILE you are building the project out.
Follow social media accounts, buy books, buy courses, and invest your time and attention into all facets of actualizing the project you are trying to create.
In relation to the visual
— immersing yourself in related information will start to give you deeper awareness, turning more black dots to white.
5) Self-educate to fill in the gaps.
Too many people ask vague questions about getting started when the answer is to just start.
When you encounter a
specific problem
THAT is when you start asking
specific questions
.
Answers to specific questions are easier to find on YouTube, Google, or any other resource.
People on Twitter or elsewhere are happier to answer specific questions because they are easier to answer. A generic question will only take more time to answer because they will need to ask 3-5 clarifying questions just to know what the specific question is.
When you search for specific questions for the specific project you are learning — you build the project much faster (and only learn what you need to, no fluff).
In relation to the visual
— when you don't know what the next step is, you must self-educate to turn that black dot into a white dot.
6) Document what worked and iterate from there.
Systems.
How do you develop systems that get results?
You execute, get feedback, execute, get feedback, repeat, and document it all so you can replicate those results.
You have to know what doesn't work before you can know what works.
You MUST encounter problems that are unique to the project you are working on.
When you solve those problems, document:
What the problem was
What you learned to solve it
What results you got
Now you have something valuable to pass down to your followers.
The Notion dashboard will aid in all of this.
Get in the habit of writing down all of your discoveries.
You learn the most in life after a period of struggle.
Programmers know this well:
You spend time coding
You encounter a bug or error
You try to fix it with your current knowledge
You research how to solve it online
You bang your head against the wall because you can't figure it out
You take a break, let your subconscious make connections, and find the answer
Once that answer works (a positive result) it is solidified in your mind.
You won't make that mistake ever again.
You have just gained specific knowledge.
THAT is how you learn.
In relation to the visual
— you can piece together specific dots and turn it into content, a product, or a service.
Dive Into The Unknown
Dive into the unknown (outline a project and start immediately).
Collect the dots (emulate others, immerse yourself in an environment, and self-educate).
Connect the dots (gain clarity, create systems, and document what worked).
Then, teach the system.
Delete for good?
No, keep it
Yes, delete
