#  The Greatest Skill  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

Every. Single. Skill you can learn that will help you succeed in this space is
amplified by **persuasion.**

  * Persuasion is what separates the accounts that grow from those that don't.
  * Persuasion is what separates the accounts that make money from those that don't.
  * Persuasion is what separates the accounts that have their value heard from those who don't.

The deciding factor of all (ethical) transactions in your social, financial,
professional, and personal life depends on your ability to persuade.

Persuasion, in a nutshell, is how you convince someone to believe something.

I like to think of it as _creating an argument_ to **adopt your perspective
and see the benefit in viewing things in the way that you do**. (We systemize
this with my APAG persuasive writing framework).

Again, we are looping back to pains and benefits.

  * What are the downsides of viewing things from a certain perspective and the day-to-day pains associated with it?
  * What are the upsides of viewing things from a new perspective and the day-to-day benefits associated with it?
  * What is the process for getting there and can you make it simple enough to act on immediately?

If you kept those 3 questions in mind when creating — your engagement, sales,
authority, and perceived value will shoot through the roof.

The more specific, confident, and credible you can be with this argument, the
better.

(You make an argument credible by pulling from different sources
(perspectives) — these do not have to be scientifically proven. You do this by
consuming information that you love reading and writing about.)

 **The Building Blocks Of A Persuasive Argument**

Our goal with persuasion comes down to 3 things:

 **Sparking positive behavior change** — by working people through their
levels of awareness and persuading them to fix their problems (advice only
works if it is taken). This applies to content, products, and services.
Behavior change is what makes people remember you for changing their life.

 **Getting the conversion** — Making the sale, scheduling a date, getting
engagement, having your content shared, etc. There has to be an exchange of
value here, a transaction.

 **Mutual benefit** — the difference between manipulation and persuasion is
the benefit. We want to aim to deliver _more_ value than what we receive.

There are 6 building blocks for crafting a persuasive argument:

 **1) Reciprocity**

Our social evolution makes us feel compelled to return favors, even if it's
something like a compliment on someone's work (in exchange for something like
a retweet).

When you give value without expectation of repayment, others feel compelled to
return the favor.

This can take form as a free guide, a bonus product for a promotion, sending
someone a strategy you learned, or just wishing someone a happy Monday.

In short, give out value and good things will come to you.

This can also be used in negotiation with a price anchor — you start high and
work low.

When you do them the favor of dropping the price (intelligently) they feel
compelled to meet that favor.

 **2) Commitment / Consistency**

Humans feel obligated to follow through with their word.

When they say they are going to do something, they begin to justify to
themselves why they should do it.

A "commitment" here can be as simple as liking a post, clicking a link,
filling out a form, etc.

In the creator business, this can be used by easing people into things and
getting them to take the lowest friction action first — that is the
commitment.

After one commitment, they feel compelled to continue on that commitment —
leading to making larger and larger commitments (think of a funnel).

Here is an example sequence of commitments from low-friction to high:

  * Read the hook of a Twitter thread
  * Click the tweet to read the entire thread
  * Finish the thread because they've already started reading it
  * Retweet the thread based on your call to action at the bottom
  * Click the landing page to download your lead magnet
  * Read through the lead magnet
  * Click the call to action to buy your product
  * Go through the product
  * Click the call to action to fill out a qualifying questionnaire (for your service)
  * Get on a call to learn more about your service
  * Pay the invoice to become a client of yours

Can you see how we go from low-commitment to high-commitment as you bring
people deeper into your funnel and content ecosystem (that we will be building
out)?

Keep this in mind at all times. It works for everything.

Even in my Instagram carousels.

I start with a short and punchy sentence that once they finish, seems like a
small commitment has been made.

Then as they scroll through the carousel, I bring in deeper and deeper topics,
eventually leading to a call to action to download something of mine and bring
them deeper into my funnel.

 **3) Social Proof**

People are not confident in their day to day actions. We are constantly
looking to confirm our beliefs, choices, and actions.

Because of this, we look to others beliefs, choices, and actions to see if
something is credible or not.

Social proof — like testimonials, results, and word of mouth marketing is the
most powerful persuasion tool in your arsenal. The more authentic and non-
planned, the better.

A sales page with a few words and tons of social proof will always outperform
a sales page with tons of words and low social proof.

Other examples of social proof:

  *  **The engagement on a post** — When I post a screenshot of a tweet to Instagram with the engagement included, I get more engagement because other people have already liked it and validated the idea. If I retweet a post that has 100 likes, it will do better than if I retweet a post with 2 likes.
  *  **The amount of followers you have** — at the start, you will grow slower simply because you don't have much social proof. We talk about ways to work around this in the Bachelors curriculum.
  *  **The amount of customers one has** — I have 1000+ members inside Modern Mastery HQ, so I flex that.

How often an idea is talked about — If everyone starts talking about how seed
oils are bad, many are going to hop on the train without doing any research
themselves.

There are many variations of social proof. Start searching for creative ways
to use it in your hooks (like statistics), posts, and promotions.

 **4) Liking**

You are more likely to trust and be persuaded by somebody that you like.

This displays the power of a properly executed personal brand.

With a personal brand, you are guiding people's perception of you.

If you are speaking to a specific group of people with similar interests as
you, it is likely that they like who you are.

This alone will have people buying from you as opposed to a huge brand that is
selling a similar product.

 **Last tip on liking:** We tend to like people that like us.

You see this in social situations all the time. Just by being interested in
the other person and liking what you see, the other person starts to like you
in return.

 **5) Authority**

We tend to trust authoritative figures much quicker than less authoritative
people.

Authority is determined by:

  * Level of expertise
  * Accomplishments in a specific area
  * Well known labels, symbols, or achievements (like the Nobel Prize, NYT Best Seller, or just something like a police uniform)
  * Amount of social proof
  * Celebrity or micro-celebrity status
  * Speaking with confidence and using absolutes (wisely)

All of these can be baked into our brand, content, and products with a bit of
tacticality, self-development, and creativity.

 **6) Scarcity**

In other words, FOMO.

When Bitcoin skyrockets, people buy more out of emotion.

When Bitcoin drops hard, people sell more out of emotion.

The best traders and investors know that this isn't when you are supposed to
buy and sell, but we do it anyway.

Scarcity is a gauge for how valuable something is — simple supply and demand.

This can be abused very easily — so ease into your use of scarcity and do your
best to be ethical about it.

Scarcity can be worked into your content or products.

For example, one reason why cohorts like this sell very well is because there
is a deadline for enrollment. The last day is always the day you make more
sales.

The same goes for special product launches, limited quantities available,
deadlines on promotional offers, and the rest.

 **These come from Robert Cialdini's book _Influence._**

All of those 6 building blocks solve fixed action patterns in one's brain. In
essence, by including more of these to form a persuasive argument, you are
making it seamless for people to get what they want out of your brand,
content, and products.

__

Be Mindful

Whenever you are writing or speaking, put effort into constructing a
persuasive argument for the sake of a positive beneficial outcome.

This will hurt your brain at first. Give it time and practice — it will become
second nature.

**The Conversion Process**

There are many persuasion, storytelling, and sales frameworks out there (those
3 things are all the same in structure).

The purpose of all of these is to get people to act — or to convert — at
whatever part of the funnel they are in (again, keep levels of awareness in
mind here).

I have distilled the patterns in these frameworks into a simple and hopefully
understandable process that you can use for every touchpoint of your brand,
content, and products.

You can treat these as an extra 6 practical building blocks for persuasion if
you would like. You can piece them together for impactful short or long-form
content.

These can be used individually for short form content, or in step-by-step
succession for longer form content.

 **1) The Big Problem**

Almost every story, sales page, and even tweet has a problem that is
explicitly stated or implied by describing a part of the situation.

The big problem can branch into smaller problems that people experience
because of that problem.

By painting a picture of the problem that an individual is facing, you begin
to make them aware of it and seek a solution.

This usually occurs in the introduction or "lead" of a long-form piece of
content.

 **2) Agitate & Dig Deeper**

On a sales call, your job is to be a doctor. You ask questions to dig deeper
and understand what pain this is actually causing the problem.

In content, you don't have to ask questions, but you can guide people deeper
into how the big problem is impacting their experience (raising their
awareness even more).

 **3) Relatability**

Like social proof, people want their beliefs, choices, and actions to be
confirmed. See "confirmation bias" in psychology.

If you can relate to the problems people are experiencing with personal or
client stories, you show them that change is possible — and that they aren't
in the wrong.

This is also why memes do so well. They help people feel like they aren't
alone.

 **4) Benefits**

Can you see how this is forming a story-like structure?

Humans love transformations (just look at physique transformations on
YouTube).

Transformations are inspirational — but they don't have to be literal
transformations.

The _thought_ of an implied transformation by showing the benefits to
overcoming certain problems is a transformation in itself.

If readers' awareness levels are high enough, that is when they will act on on
the step-by-step solution you give them.

When you are talking about a product, the usual option is to flex the
"features" of that product rather than the benefits of those features. Both
are necessary, but the benefits are what sell.

A benefit is how their life is affected on a direct and _specific_ level.
Specificity is key here.

 **Feature** : 1 gigabyte of storage.

 **Benefit** : Never run out of space for storing memories of your newborn
son.

The latter is targeted at a _specific type of person_ that would use the 1
gigabyte of storage in a _specific way._

Can you guess what the type of person is and how we are painting a picture of
how they would use that feature? (You don't have to be explicit. Often times
it is better to be implicit. Let the reader fill in the blanks with their
imagination.)

The best way to register this type of benefits rich language is to keep your
eyes peeled for content and landing pages that do it well.

 **5) The Perfect Solution**

As we are crafting this argument with pains, agitation, relatability, and
benefits — we are raising peoples awareness to the point of becoming aware of
a solution.

This is your chance to present one that is perceived as the near-perfect
solution for them in that situation.

That is the thing here, this solution is _perceived_ as the perfect solution
based on the argument you've constructed (the reality you've created through
communication and framing the argument).

Your job is to position a solution according to the problem and person you are
speaking to.

Your job is to cause that raise in dopamine that sparks the "aha!" moment. The
breakthrough. The "this may finally be the solution to my problem."

 _Then, you deliver as much value as you possibly can to fulfill that
promise._

Keep in mind that this argument is constructed in different ways across your
entire brand. That is where the fun and creativity come into play.

 **6) Clarity On Next Steps**

"How to" guides always do well for one reason — it gives people the one thing
they crave (and often lack — _clarity._

The best call to actions at the end of a post give step by step, low-friction
ways of guiding the reader to take the next action (or make the next
commitment).

You see this:

  *  **In Twitter threads** — "Go to the first tweet that is linked here, press the retweet button, come back, and read the next tweet."
  *  **In Call To Actions** — "Buy Now" - "Download the free guide"
  *  **In How To Guides** — Giving clear and actionable steps to achieving a desired outcome

The more specific you can get with this, the better. People often need step-
by-step instruction on what to do next.

Play The Game

Play the game of influence until you become so good that you can be artful
with your craft and "draw outside of the lines."

Train your mind to think in terms of problems and benefits that occur in any
given situation. This is how you turn topics, life experiences, and random
thoughts into compelling content.
