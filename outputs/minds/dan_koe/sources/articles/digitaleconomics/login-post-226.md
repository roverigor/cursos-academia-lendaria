#  Action Steps & My Brand Journey  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Remove from
my favorites")

So far, we've learned:

  * How to manage your time and energy as a creator
  * What makes an effective _personal_ brand
  * How to create your own niche by prioritizing your interests
  * The first iteration of your life's work that you will actualize with the power of social media
  * Nuances to creating a profile that attracts the right followers

In the next module, we will be diving deep into content creation. That's where
the real fun begins. Until then, here are some lever-moving actions that you
should be adding to your to-do list every day.

 **Lever Moving Actions**

 **1) Create the first iteration of your profile.**

Create a clickable profile picture, welcoming bio, and header image that puts
off the vibe you want.

You can always go back through the previous modules as you are doing this.

 **2) Study your mentors and try to emulate their content style.**

You can download the [Twemex](https://twemex.app/) twitter extension to view
certain accounts' top tweets. You can also use
[TweetHunter](https://thedankoe.com/get/tweethunter) for the same features and
be able to schedule your tweets.

Study them and try to recreate your own content from those.

 _Start posting at least 1 tweet a day._

Eventually, you will work up to 3-5 a day. I am currently posting 3.

Don't worry about optimal post times just yet.

Anything between 5am and 2pm ET seems to work just fine.

If you have a lot of content ideas, feel free to go scorched earth for the
sake of practicing your content writing.

 **3) Outline a newsletter based on the interest you want to build authority
in.**

This can stem from a lead-magnet outline — or it can serve as a way of
generating content and thread ideas.

You can start now (which I would recommend) or wait until we go over the long-
form writing framework.

If you'd like, write this newsletter as a Twitter thread first and use the
Non-Needy Networking process to have larger accounts retweet it — meaning you
will grow faster.

That thread can always be sent as a newsletter down the road. Likewise with
newsletters, they can always be turned into threads later on.

It is NOT a waste to start writing long-form content now. You can reuse those
ideas forever and build on top of those thoughts.

 **4) Start adding value to other accounts by engaging with and DMing them to
build connections.**

When you are replying to accounts — add on to the thought. Don't just reword
or reiterate what they said.

Talk about a problem you had relating to that problem and what solved it for
you.

This can also help spark content ideas of your own. Do you have a different
perspective or application of their content?

 _Start blocking off 15-30 minutes to engage with at least 10 accounts a day._

 _While you are at it, DM 1 of those accounts per day using the Non-Needy
Networking._

All of these can and should be added to the Daily Focus section of your Notion
dashboard.

 **The Evolution Of My Brand**

Most people only see the polished product of my brand.

I've built:

  * 10+ lead magnets
  * 2 ebooks
  * 3 courses
  * 1 community (with hundreds of articles and trainings)
  * Sold 2 different freelancing service
  * Sold 3 different consulting offers
  * I've changed my bio 100+ times
  * I've changed my header image 20+ times
  * I've written 10s of thousands of tweets
  * Sent 100+ emails
  * Built funnels for all of my products and lead magnets

Every one was better than the next.

 **My best advice has and will always be:** publish as fast as you possibly
can and iterate from there. You can start over and pivot whenever you please.

You don't see the steps I took and that can be intimidating. I want to go over
my brand evolution in the video below.
