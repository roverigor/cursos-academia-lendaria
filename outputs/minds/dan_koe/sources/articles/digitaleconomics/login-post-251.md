#  Instagram  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

While I’m not a fan of Instagram as a whole (a lot of closed-mindedness and
arguments that you’ll have to learn to ignore) it is low-hanging fruit.

It can take no longer than 5 minutes to screenshot one of your best tweets of
the day, throw it in Canva, add a background color, and post it to Instagram.

You can do this as you grow on Twitter just to have a consistent and active
page. Some of your Twitter followers will transfer over.

I would recommend posting on either Instagram or LinkedIn when it comes time
to branch out — they can both be “copy-paste” from your Twitter until you are
ready to create a growth strategy (by leveraging other’s audiences).

 **How To Repurpose Your Content For Instagram**

There are a few ways to do this.

I started off by screenshotting tweets from my phone, uploading them to Canva,
and posting them every morning when I wake up.

Another way to do this would be TweetPik.com

That is what I use now to post my best tweets (or a carousel of related
tweets) to Instagram itself.

For graphics and visualizations, I use Figma.com.

There are plenty of tutorials online to learn the basics of Figma fast.

I personally only use black and white shapes, lines, and text to visualize a
big idea from my newsletter.

 **How To Send Traffic With Instagram**

There are a few things to pay attention to when sending traffic with
Instagram:

 **The Captions Of Your Posts**

Your captions can double as LinkedIn posts. You can write them on LinkedIn
first or on Instagram.

I tend to have a mix. If I want to write a longer post for LinkedIn or
Instagram, I will. If not, I’ll keep it short, insightful, and to the point.

You can use the AIDA, PAS, or APAG persuasive writing frameworks for all of
this. Similar to how you would write a thread, but condensed. Instagram
captions do not have to be long, but the longer you hold attention, the more
likely people will be to follow through on your call to action.

At the end of your captions, include a strong and CLEAR call to action about
where to go next.

You should include a call to action in every single caption.

You can send people to:

  * The link in your bio (like a LinkTree, newsletter, or personal site)
  * Your story highlights if they have links (your story highlights can act as a Linktree in itself)
  * Your story (you would post the link to your story after you mention it in the call to action of the caption)

 **Call To Actions At The End Of Videos, Reels, Or Carousels**

Follow a 3 to 1 value to promotion ratio with these posts.

You can have a call to action in every caption, but in the posts themselves, I
would limit it.

This is similar to a podcast, have a strong AIDA or PAS focused call to action
to tell them where to go next in a clear, specific, and straightforward
manner.

I try to view my content as content and like keeping promotions to ONLY be in
the captions.

This simplifies things for me. I don’t promote in the reels and carousels
themselves, but it is an option for sending traffic.

 **Singular Or A Sequence Of Stories With A Link**

I don't have a set method for this. I usually screenshot the text from my
Twitter promotions and add them to my story (then all I have to do is add the
link).

However, you can promote with individual stories or create a sequence of
stories that leads people into your promotion.

To keep things simple, it is OKAY if you just screenshot from Twitter and post
to your stories.

 **The Link In Your Bio**

Your link in bio can be a link to your newsletter, personal site, or LinkTree.

If you have multiple things to promote, I would use a LinkTree. That way when
you tell people to go to the link in bio, there isn't much friction in finding
the right link.

 **Your Story Highlights**

Story highlights are like a LinkTree in themselves. You can house old stories
of yours in the story highlights and tell people to go find the link there.

 **How To Leverage Others' Audiences With Instagram**

I personally do not recommend anything aside from story shares. Why?

I’ve tried the shoutouts that other accounts do, they rarely result in a lot
of followers that actually engage with your posts.

I’ve seen some accounts get to 300K followers by paying a ton of money for
shoutouts, but they end up getting 200-300 likes MAX on their posts. It
doesn’t make sense to waste that money.

Not only are story shares cheaper (because people don’t realize the value in
them yet) you:

  * Allow people to click through and follow you because they like your content.
  * Attract people that actually watch stories, meaning they will watch yours (also meaning that your story promotions will get more viewers).
  * You will have guaranteed active followers in proportion to the quality (and persuasiveness) of your content. This is why learning to write is just as important for Instagram as it is for Twitter.

That is the simplest way I can describe leveraging others’ audiences on
Instagram.

You can use the engagement strategy mentioned previously to build an
Instagram-specific mastermind group. You would swap “retweets” with story
shares in this case.

This shouldn't need a video to explain this. You send the post you want
shared, they share it to only their story without tagging you or saying to
follow you. That's it. As similar to a retweet as you can make it.  

Delete for good?

No, keep it

Yes, delete
