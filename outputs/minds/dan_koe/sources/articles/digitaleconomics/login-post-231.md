#  The Experience Model  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Remove from my
favorites")

Keep in mind — this is my philosophy behind personal branding and content.
This section will be more theory than step-by-step processes or systems. Keep
that in mind. This won’t be inherently actionable. Treat it as a seed of
awareness to make sense of over time.

I did not bring this up in the previous module so you can focus your attention
and priorities on a select few interests or skills that you choose to master.

At the end of the day, your unique experience on this Earth **while pursuing
those interests** is what people care about — not the interests themselves.

People care about **how those interests will help impact their life**. Your
interests are the “how.”

They could care less which interest it is. They care about how it will make
their life better.

If I have a desire to get a more lucrative job and you can create a persuasive
argument that shows me web development (an example interest) is the best way
to do that, I will listen to you.

You add firepower to this persuasive argument by considering all aspects of
the lifestyle associated with it. **Your lifestyle is unique.** No matter how
“boring” you may think your lifestyle is — it is not.

Once you have hooked them in with certain aspects of your life experiences, it
is up to you to educate them on how to get there (through authoritative
content, newsletters, and other things like a lead magnet, product, or
service.)

You attract a unique following of people by talking about your life
experiences — your lifestyle. Your life experiences are the “why” behind your
interests. The pains, benefits, and range of emotions associated with your
lifestyle.

 _This is how you start to bridge the gap between “work” and “life.”_

 **Your Domain Of Mastery Is A Vessel For Self-Development (Most Importantly,
Mental Development)**

Your Domain Of Mastery is a structured way of digging deeper into life and
connecting its sub-components. **It is a way of guiding your learning.**

Learning, dissecting, connecting, and teaching is how you start branching into
the iceberg of life itself.

You may not make this connection yet — but all worthwhile paths in life lead
to the same endpoint, _which is life itself._ As you dig deeper and deeper
into your Domain Of Mastery you will realize that everything connects.

This requires a foundation of self-development.

A foundation of self-development creates the opportunity for unlimited unique
content ideas.

Self-development implies that you are actively improving your mind, body,
spirit, finances, and life itself.

 **The most important pillar here is the mind.** Mental expansion and
intellectual development are the foundation of diving deeper into your Domain
Of Mastery.

Think about it… the people that make the most money (and the greatest impact
on the world) are not manual labor workers. There is a reason they are
consistently being phased out.

The people that make the largest impact and most money are the creators,
strategists, visionaries, leaders, and innovators of the world. They CREATE
solutions with their mind.

 **Expanding your mind = increasing your creative potential.**

In the 3rd module of this course, I will be giving you a structured way of
developing your mind and creating unique solutions, perspectives, and
theories.

 **You must become a “thought leader,”** as cringe as that may sound.

 _That means you have to take yourself, your work, and your life seriously._

If you have yet to choose a 3rd complimentary interest for your Domain Of
Mastery, I would highly recommend self-development or mental mastery as a
whole. This will help you master your Domain much faster and create unique
perspectives for your content.

The iceberg of self-development contains things like:

  * Psychology
  * Spirituality
  * Survival
  * Metaphysics
  * Human potential
  * Philosophy
  * Leadership
  * Strategy
  * Learning
  * Creativity
  * Cosmology
  * Human behavior
  * Performance & productivity

In general, understanding life itself and expanding your mind. The things that
will help you create innovative solutions to modern problems (and eventually
make some money doing so)!

Self-development as a whole will increase the impact of whatever money-making
skill you choose to build authority in. Because once you understand how to
develop yourself, you understand how to develop others.

Personal growth = business growth.

My favorite resource that everyone should be exposed to is Actualized.org.

[Listen to this lecture in your free time](https://youtu.be/BqWPqZK-Ikg) and
tell me that you don’t have LOADS of unique content ideas come to mind.

If you want books to read, [here are my
favorites](https://youtu.be/609vZAF0JVI). **Flow and The Art Of Impossible in
particular.**

Everyone that goes through these resources will have their own unique
takeaways based on what sparks their curiosity.

 **Developmental Stages & Removing Saturation**

If everyone talked about what they do, the lessons they’ve learned, and the
interests they are pursuing in a confident and persuasive manner — everyone
would attract the right people.

That is — if you were your true authentic self pursuing your genuine curiosity
while posting online, you would attract the perfect community of people (and
be able to create an income source for yourself by providing a unique product
or service to them).

This is quite possibly the hardest thing to wrap your head around and
understand in this course. Mainly because people are out of touch with their
nature and lack authenticity due to a lack of development in certain areas of
life.

Ken Wilber talks a lot about developmental states and stages.

 **States are a temporary period** — like if you felt extra creative for an
hour or two.

 **Stages are permanent** — like if you developed your mind to a point of a
new baseline level of creativity.

Your job is to dive into each interest of your Domain Of Mastery and develop
your knowledge, skill, and understanding of those areas until you hit a new
stage.

This new stage implies that other people want to reach that stage and will pay
to do so.

Now, you can package up a process that got you to that stage and teach it to
the person that is “1 step behind you.”

In order to reach those new stages of development in any given interest — your
mind will need to develop to match that stage.

 **As you evolve, your content and products will evolve.**

I no longer do freelance, coaching, or client work as a whole. I have reached
a new stage of development and can help others get to those stages.

All of the products I've sold have iterated into something completely
different.

Every time I have evolved, **I have in essence “desaturated” that market.**
(And so have all other one-person businesses, they evolve and open up room for
the next generation).

I can create a ladder to help other people to that next stage and the cycle
goes on.

That is how life works.

This is another reason why the “one-person business model” or creator economy
can never be saturated. Individuals change and evolve so they can teach the
next generation that they align with.

Become A Sense Maker

Your job is to make sense of life to the people that understand you.

The way you make sense of life is by developing yourself and your skills in
your Domain Of Mastery.

Your job is to provide clarity to those that align with your values, vision,
goals, beliefs, and other components of your identity (this is what forms your
perspective on things).

**Try To Find The Lesson In Every Experience**

Stop trying to find your passion. Instead, cultivate a passion for life
itself. All of its highs and lows. It SHOULD be difficult to have passion for
a specific 1-3 things in life because you want to be passionate about
everything.

Seek to understand and learn from everything in life. This makes life 10x more
enjoyable when you start to see the depth in everything you come across.

The worst thing you can do is take everything you learn as law.

  * Tweets
  * Books
  * Articles
  * Podcasts

Anything. You must take what you learned, apply it to your life, and seek to
understand it through experience.

You need to run it through your current perspective, value system, beliefs,
biases, and seek to understand that idea on a deeper level.

You were put on this earth to piece together the puzzle of reality – your
personal brand is how you document your findings.

You understand by questioning everything, piecing things together, and
creating clarity. You are learning, experiencing, and understanding to gain
awareness to create unique solutions (filling in and connecting the dots of
life).

I want you to start thinking of your content as a map.

For the next 3-5 years, your job is to document everything you can make sense
of online. Your content is a map for navigating life from your unique
perspective.

 _Your content is your reality._

 _Your content is a giant story that you are piecing together._

 _Your content is the projection of your mind that creates a world for others
to explore._

 **Attracting Like-Minded People Without Focusing On A "Niche"**

When you target your former, current, and future self by talking about your
experiences, lessons, beliefs, and failures — **you are targeting the perfect
niche**. You are attracting people that want to learn from you. They want to
have those same experiences and are open to diving into the interests that got
you there.

By talking about your life with confidence and conviction is how you target an
ultra-specific type of individual.

Throughout this section, I am telling you that “self-development is an
absolute must.”

I FIRMLY believe that self-development is necessary for an interesting and
fulfilling life. It’s a part of my life philosophy. Others won’t agree. That’s
fine, they won’t get value from my message. That is how it is targeted at a
specific type of person.

Do this enough and you will be attracting a very specific type of person.

I would not be surprised if everyone taking this course is here because of the
“niche” I’ve created by doing this.

 **If you are looking for job opportunities OR have a service targeted at a
more specific business or avatar:**

I would still recommend going this route, but with a few nuances.

You have 2 options that are dependent on your current business goals:

 **1) Build a niche audience slow.**

Audience building in this manner is usually slow because people don't like
being sold from the start. If you have a pitch in your bio, it may even do
more damage than good.

If you _know_ you can get in front of your perfect customer avatar on Twitter
or another platform, you can go this route.

This is where you would create hyper-targeted authority content around your
service and the problems of your customer avatar.

However, an automated direct outreach campaign (or sending resumes) would get
you results much faster — so the second option may be the best option either
way.

 **2) Build a leverageable audience fast.**

By going broad and using The Experience Model and Domain Of Mastery you build
an audience fast.

When you talk about _what you do_ , people remember.

When you educate people on the skills, results, and expertise you have, you
will attract the people interested in those skills (or already using those
skills).

You would attract people that are interested in what you are building. The
people that are interested in that are probably in a similar space as you.

The people that are interested in those skills will potentially have access to
your niche customer avatar and spread your name.

If you talk about marketing (your skill) and how that applies to startups
(your work) even from a beginner, broad level — you are going to attract
startup founders, marketers, and others interested in learning about marketing
or startups.

That network can get you in front of the right people and spread your work as
your audience grows.

In this case, you would focus on long-term leverage by building:

  * Educational content for the lower levels of awareness (the beginner market)
  * Establishing authority by talking about your results, skills, and how that expertise applies to what you do
  * Growing by doing what works on any given platform — writing more broad, high impact content relating to your life experiences (and what we discussed above).

By doing this, you build an audience of 50-100K+ that knows exactly what you
do and can spread your name to a number of people that is 5-10x that amount.

 _Start thinking about the opportunities you will generate with the impact of
30K tweets instead of the results you will get from the 3 you post today._

And, if you ever want to build out a value ladder of offers, pivot your main
offer, create your own customers (through educational content), or not have to
worry about direct outreach, you have the leverage to do that.

 **One example:**

Do copywriters talk about their specific customers' problems? Or do they give
beginner-level tips on copywriting and also post about the lessons they've
learned _while_ copywriting (that are applicable to a much broader audience)?

Do they have a profile that screams "I'm going to close you as a client!"

Or do they _show_ their expertise and let people spread their name for them
(while possibly doing direct outreach with a targeted message on the side)?

It's a difference in education, showing people what you do, and flexing your
expertise without targeting a hyper-specific person.

 **In Summary (Focus On This)**

I am telling you not to shy away from posting your beliefs, ideas, thoughts,
experiments, insights, and anything else that crosses your mind (that can be
woven into a high-performing tweet).

Something as simple as this hits all of the requirements for an engaging,
polarizing, and authentic post:

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28913212_1655820266CBfdickie_tweet.png)

We will dive into attention and engagement soon, but can you see how Dickie:

  * Catches attention with a pattern interrupt (squiggly lines)
  * Uses numbers to capture and hold attention further
  * Implies a transformation
  * Uses confidence and conviction to polarize hot and cold coffee drinkers (meaning they will comment their stance and boost engagement)
  * The image “flexes” his lifestyle with something as simple — and what could be uninteresting to those he doesn’t want in his audience — as a journal

This is masterful for such a simple and seemingly innocent post.

Don’t become neurotic about ONLY posting about your interests or areas of
expertise. That is not how you create a unique and timeless personal brand
(but is still necessary to fulfill the 3 pillars of social leverage).

This is another reason why Twitter should be the center of all of your
content. It is the perfect testing ground, it is raw, and you can post as many
times as you’d like without much repercussion (unlike any other platform).

Then, you can take your best content and cross-post to other platforms.

Your Niche Is You

Don't be afraid to talk about your life, experiences, and expertise. You are
attracting people like you — meaning they like what you like and want to do
what you do. You are the leader of your followers.
