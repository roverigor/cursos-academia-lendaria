# Neural Pathways

The most complex object in the known universe sits between your ears. Your brain.

Despite its complexity, at its core, it has only one driving purpose:

Keep you alive so you can pass on your genes. Of course, there are many other things you want out of life \- such as financial freedom, physical health, and good relationships.

But to your brain, those things are secondary. Distracting, even. There’s too much going on at any given moment for your brain to consciously keep up with. It’s evolved the ability to offload certain things to your unconscious so your conscious mind is freed up.

You’ve probably heard the analogy that the brain is like a computer. While this is accurate, I’d reverse it \- a computer is like the brain. The brain is incomprehensibly more complex than the best supercomputer we’ve ever built.

By the end of this course, you’ll know how to use your brain to transform yourself and achieve your goals. To be best equipped to change your habits, you must first understand your habits. Let's begin...

Neurons

Your brain is made up of billions of cells called neurons.

Every thought you have, emotion you feel, and action you take involves an electrical signal flowing from a neuron’s soma (cell body), down its axon (signal carrier), and into the dendrites (signal receptors) of another neuron.

The signal flows through a neural pathway made up of lots of neurons connected together in this way.

As a neural pathway is used more and more, the axons of the neurons involved get coated in layers of an insulating substance called myelin. Myelin allows signals to travel more efficiently \- the more myelin an axon has, the less time and energy it takes for a signal to travel along it.

When you do something for the first time \- say, swinging a tennis racquet \- it uses a new combination of neurons. It takes a lot of conscious thought. You probably don’t even do it right. Your swing was wild, the tennis ball went flying out of the court, and someone’s dog ran off with it.

But when you keep doing something, you keep using the neural pathway associated with it. When you keep using the neural pathway associated with your racquet swing, more myelin gets added to the neurons in the pathway. 

The signal of your racquet swing gets more efficient and you start noticing your swing is getting better. After a few sessions, you suddenly realize you don’t even think about your swing anymore \- you see the ball coming and you swing your racquet without a thought.

Why does this happen?

# The Autopilot

Think of it this way: Your brain is like a car.

Your conscious is the driver \- it chooses where to go. Your unconscious is the engine \- it powers your car and gets you from place to place.

But the car in this analogy has a twist. It’s equipped with an automatic guidance system \- an autopilot. It quickly learns where you go often, memorizes the path, and starts going there automatically. This makes life easier for the driver, because they don't have to think about the destination anymore \- they just hop in the car, turn the key, and away they go.

It also makes the car more fuel efficient, because getting somewhere with the autopilot in charge uses less fuel than if the driver was in charge. It’s like the cruise control on your actual car, only better.

Think about how the autopilot analogy relates to the tennis example I just used.

When you do something for the first time, it’s new to your brain. It’s entirely conscious and it takes a lot of thought. It’s a little uncomfortable \- you’re literally rewiring your brain and creating new neural pathways. It's not in your autopilot yet.

The action is slow, clunky, and just plain weird. But you persevere and keep at it. When you repeat an action, the neurons in the pathway get myelin added to them, which makes the signal take less time and energy. The action gets faster, cleaner, and feels more natural.

Eventually, something magical happens \- it starts taking less conscious thought and becomes more unconscious. In fact, your brain starts preferring to take that action, because it’s more efficient. That's when the efficient, practiced action becomes part of your autopilot.

It also prefers actions in your autopilot because actions you’re not as familiar with are less efficient. For example, a while back, I switched to a two-handed backhand tennis swing from the one-handed swing I was far more used to.

My brain didn’t like this \- when the ball was coming to my left side, I’d automatically ready myself for a one-handed backhand. I had to put a lot of conscious thought into going for a two-handed backhand. I had to consciously overpower what my brain wanted to do unconsciously. I had to consciously reprogram my autopilot, which is something we'll dive into soon.

We’ve covered how your brain handles repeated actions. Now, let’s look at how your brain handles repeated routines \- also known as habits, the subject of this course.

# Habit Formation

A sequence of actions is called a routine. A routine which results in a reward will likely become a habit.

Important note: Habits can form even if the routine and/or the reward hurt your health, such as the habitual overuse of alcohol and sugar. They can also persist, even when we risk losing our reputation, or friends, or even our job.

Also, a reward doesn't always mean you get something good (gaining pleasure). A reward could also be avoiding something bad (avoiding pain). It can also be both. Some habits, like my habit of taking hot baths on days I play tennis, are rewarding because they feel good and because they soothe the aches and pains from my match.

I started a routine of doing so, and since it was rewarding, that routine became a habit. So, I now take a hot bath every day I play tennis.

Similarly, many alcohol addicts developed their drinking habit not only because alcohol tastes good, but it helps them cope with the emotional pain of their lives.

How Routines Become Habits

When a routine leads to a reward, your brain realizes it’s going to need that routine often so it can keep getting that reward. But, it’s not energy efficient to have to think about the routine every time. 

To save energy, your brain encodes the routine as a habit in a part of your brain called the basal ganglia, which is like the heart of your autopilot.

After the routine becomes a habit, the basal ganglia chooses if you carry out a routine or avoid a routine, depending on the expected outcome.

As long as a routine is worthwhile (meaning the reward is achievable with an appropriate amount of effort), the routine will be carried out whenever possible and the preference to carry out the routine will grow stronger.

Also, for optimal habit formation, rewards need to immediately follow the routine instead of occuring days or even hours after the routine.

For example, you could set a goal of running a marathon in 6 months. The feeling of crossing the finish line will be immensely rewarding, but the anticipation of that reward isn't enough to get you to start a habit of training for the marathon.

Instead, your training runs have to end in a reward \- it doesn't take much, it just has to be something to reward your brain for the run so that your basal ganglia will choose to do it again in the future.

easily and quickly obtained reward \= a strong habit

If a routine isn't worthwhile, it'll be unlikely for it to become a habit. Remember, habits are all about rewards. If you want to build a habit, you need to have a worthwhile (and immediate) reward. If the reward is too far off or if the reward isn't worth the effort you put in, the habit won't have much of a reason to form.

You'll get better at the routine via repetition (as described in the first few pages of this chapter), but your brain won't see much of a reason to turn it into a habit.

difficult to obtain reward \= a weak habit or no habit at all.

Almost everything you do on a daily basis is habitual \- controlled by your autopilot. Whether you knew it or not, you programmed your autopilot with your repeated routines and rewards.

Every day, you're modifying that programming \- some habits get stronger, some habits get weaker.

Your brain wants to keep getting rewards, so it keeps executing your strongest habits and taking you to the same places, time after time. There is one problem, though...

What if you don't want to keep going to the same places? What if you want to go somewhere new? What if you want to achieve something new?

Reprogramming the Autopilot

If you want to change your life, you have to reprogram your autopilot. To reprogram your autopilot, you have to change your habits.

Now that you know how habits are formed, let's now look at how your habits work. Once we've covered that, I'll explain how you can begin breaking your bad habits and start creating good habits.

- # Habit Loops

# Cue, Craving, Response, Reward

A habit is like a loop with four stages: Cue, Craving, Response, and Reward.

The habit loop model was popularized by Charles Duhigg in his 2012 book The Power of Habit, and expanded on in James Clear's 2018 book Atomic Habits.

The loop works like this:

A cue happens, you crave a reward, you respond by doing what you need to do to get the reward, and then you get the reward.

Over the next three pages, I'll walk you through the loops of two bad habits and the loop of a good habit. You'll quickly understand each stage after you read through the three examples.

First, I'll walk through an example of a bad habit you've certainly dealt with: Emotional eating.

This was a big problem for me while I was in college. The relentless classes, projects, and exams stressed me out.

My brain thought "hey, if I grab a snack, I'll feel better", so I grabbed a snack and felt a little better... and also gained around 15lbs every finals season.

During my first year out of college, I fell into a massive post-graduation rut. I was depressed all day, every day. What did I do?

I turned to emotional eating and emotional drinking, then gained 50lbs over the course of that year. I tell you that story to impress upon you the importance of recognizing not only your bad habits, but also the loops those habits use.

Here’s an example of a habit loop in action:

Stage 1: Cue

It's late on a Sunday afternoon. You've got an exam to study for, a paper to finish, and a project to think about. You're stressed.

That stress is the cue for your brain to start thinking "you know what sounds good right now? Some Doritos. Yeah, some Doritos would make me feel better..."

Note: a cue can be virtually anything \- an emotion, a sound, a time of day, a person, a place, a smell, etc.

Stage 2: Craving

When you start hearing that voice, you start craving Doritos. You feel a mental and physical pull to get up, go to the kitchen, and grab the bag in your pantry. Despite your best efforts to distract yourself, you can't shake your Dortios  
craving.

Stage 3: Response

Eventually, you give in. "I can't let this craving distract me from the work I have to do," you think to yourself.

You respond to the craving by going to the kitchen, grabbing the bag of Doritos, and taking them back to your room. A few crinkles and crunches later, your desk and your shirt are covered in red dust. You feel a hint of disgust with yourself for giving in to your craving again.

Stage 4: Reward

Your reward for your Doritos binge (aside from the tasty chips themselves) is feeling better. You've satisfied the craving and silenced the voice in your head begging for a snack.

Result

Remember earlier when I said habits are routines that end in rewards?

Since this time through the habit loop resulted in the reward your brain wanted, the habit has gotten a little stronger. It's also gotten a little harder to break or even resist the habit.

# Good Habits vs Bad Habits

A good habit is one that gets you closer to your ideal life and the best version of yourself. A bad habit is one that takes you further away from those things.

I'm not saying everyone should go run at 6:00am every day. I'm also not saying no one should ever enjoy a snack when they're feeling down or check their phone sometimes.

Those things are fine in moderation \- but most people don't (or can't) moderate them, and they habitually do them far too often. I've been there, and if you're there now, I want to help you get out of that situation.

The purpose of this course is to educate you about habits and teach you how you can change your habits to best pursue your goals and the life you want. But you still need to figure out what your ideal life is and what habits you need to start or stop to make it a reality.

It's usually pretty clear (my emotional eating and drinking were obviously taking me away from my goals), but sometimes it's not. Of course, if you need help clarifying that, you can always contact me\!

# Friction

A major key of the habit loop is "friction".

Friction refers to how hard it is for you to go through the response stage of the loop. In my previous examples of emotional eating and checking your phone, the responses have low friction. They're both quite easy.

Low friction \= easy response \= easily obtained reward \= a strong habit.

In the example of morning exercise, that loop also had low friction. But what if it had high friction instead? Say instead of going for a run, you want to go to the gym. But the gym is halfway across town... You'd have to get in your car, drive there, and then drive back...

There's a lot of friction in that response. Nah. Back to bed\!

High friction \= difficult response \= difficult to obtain reward \= a weak habit.

Changing Habits with Friction

As you'll see in the next two chapters, the concept of friction will be a primary component of breaking your bad habits and starting good habits.

Your brain is lazy. It wants to conserve energy \- that's why it evolved to have habits in the first place. So if you make your bad habits too easy and your good habits too difficult, your brain will take the easy path. Your future will have lots of Doritos and few morning runs.

But the reverse is also true \- if you increase the friction of your bad habits and decrease the friction of your good habits, your life will change for the better.

And your life IS about to change for the better. You excited? I'm excited for you\!

Using the Habit Loop Worksheet  
In the course files, you'll find a worksheet called "Habit Loop Worksheet".

You'll see it's broken up into six sections:

• The Description section is where you define the habit you're trying to build or break  
• The next four sections (Cue, Craving, Response, and Reward) relate to the four stages of the habit loop you want to build or break  
• Lastly, the Friction section is for the friction of that particular habit

The first page of the Habit Loop Worksheet file is blank \- that's the one you can print off and fill out.

I've filled out the remaining pages with examples of loops for bad habits and good habits. They each show you how I'd fill out the worksheet for a habit I've broken or started.

Before you go through the next two chapters of the book, I recommend printing off a couple copies of the blank Habit Loop Worksheet so you can follow along with your own habits.

If you don't have access to a printer, then just grab a pen and paper and write things down as you go. I promise doing this will greatly increase your chances at succeeding at changing your habits.

- # Breaking Bad Habits

# Breaking Bad Habits

Think about your bad habits. They all have two things in common: loops (cues, cravings, responses, and rewards) and low friction (low enough for you to still be following them). That gives you five places where you could attack a bad habit.

Right? Actually, no \- the cue and craving aren't usually ideal places to start. Here's why:

Cue

Many people fail at breaking a bad habit because they target the cue. To stop the cue from kicking off a habit loop, they remove the cue from their life for a while. For example, a habitual drinker may dump out all of their alcohol so they aren't cued to drink. I myself tried this once.

The problem is, eliminating the cue doesn't eliminate the habit loop from your brain. Getting rid of the alcohol in your house won't stop you from being cued for a drink when you go to the store or to a restaurant. What follows the cue?

Craving. Response. Reward. A stronger habit.

Unless you overpower your autopilot, the habit loop executes and then grows stronger, despite your efforts to deprive yourself of the cue.

Also, removing the cue may not even eliminate the craving. The craving may arise from a beer commercial, from a food you usually pair with an adult beverage, or just from the time of day or how you feel. Then you and your brain are miserable until the craving is rewarded, or it eventually goes away.

Even worse, addictive substances like alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine cause negative effects when you try to quit them "cold turkey" like that. Those bad feelings are related to physical cravings, and they can make you miserable for days or weeks.

I've been the habitual drinker in this story. Removing the cue can work, but it'll be unnecessarily hard on your mind, and in some cases, your body. It also doesn't teach you to have a healthy relationship with the reward you're craving. It becomes all or nothing. I've been there \- I made it days and weeks without drinking, then went back to my old binging self. It's just not a good way to break a habit. I wouldn't recommend it. Now, I can enjoy alcohol in moderation.

Craving

Since your craving is linked to the reward of the habit loop, you can't directly target your craving. You'll indirectly change your craving by changing your response and reward. So if the cue and craving are bad places to start changing your habit, that leaves…

Reward

Changing the reward of your habit (say, by eating a lower calorie snack or drinking fewer beers) can work, but you have to make the change over a few days instead of all at once. This is called "tapering down".

If you decrease the reward too quickly, your brain will be dissatisfied and you may experience the negative physical side effects I've mentioned a couple times. Ever try suddenly substituting grilled chicken and veggies in place of your burger and fries? Or having sparkling water instead of your usual six-pack of beers? It can work, but you'll face resistance from your mind and/or your body. 

Avoid the mental and physical struggle \- wean yourself off by tapering down the reward. It's easier and more effective to focus on the response and the friction of your bad habit than to try suddenly quitting the habit.

Also, think carefully about the reward of your bad habit. Perhaps it's not what you think it is. When you drink \- is the reward the alcohol, or is it the relief from your emotional pain? When you stress eat \- is the reward the snack, or is it the relief from boredom?

Bad habits often have an underlying problem. Don't just treat the symptom instead of the cause, or else you'll wind up trading one bad habit for another.

For example, I used to drink and eat too much because I was unhappy. Once I improved my life, those habits faded away.

Response (and Friction) 

When it comes to the response of your habit loop, you have three options: You can change the response itself, you can increase the friction of the response, or you can do both at the same time. For optimal results, change the response and increase the response's friction if you can.

Since your brain is lazy (a mean way of saying it likes to be efficient by conserving energy), a small change in the response and/or the friction can make a big difference in whether the habit is still deemed worthwhile or not.

As always, an example makes it more concrete:

# An Example

Peanut butter used to be my weakness. Especially when I combined it with chocolate chips. But when I was particularly stressed about something, it didn't matter what I ate, I just wanted to snack and snack and snack.

No wonder I gained so much weight my first year out of college...

Since you can't outrun a bad diet, I knew I wouldn't be able to reach my fitness goals if I didn't get my eating habits in order. I broke the habit of binging on junk food by changing my response \- changing what I snacked on. I got some strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries from the store. Every time I wanted a snack, I had a measured serving of berries instead of junk food.

Note: I'm not saying peanut butter is a junk food. But for someone who is trying to lose weight, it's a little too high calorie to be a snack. Some would say berries are bad for you too, but I'll leave that for others to argue. Berries are healthier than chips and cookies, so I'll take the win.

Alongside my response change, I also increased the friction of eating my favorite high-calorie snacks by making it just a little harder for me to get to them.

I put the peanut butter further back in the pantry underneath some cans and I buried the cookies in a cabinet. The junk was still there. I could get to it if I really wanted it. But the berries were closer, so I had the berries.

Changing friction doesn't take a whole lot \- like I said, your brain is lazy. What may seem like a comically small increase in effort to you may be enough for your brain to calculate that the reward is no longer worth the work.

Now when I crave a snack, I'm confident in myself that I can make the choice between having a healthy snack or giving myself a rare treat \- and making sure those treats stay rare.

Now think about a bad habit of your own. Hopefully you've been filling in a copy of the Habit Loop Worksheet as you've been reading. If you have, then you have an understanding of the habit's cue, craving, response, reward, and friction. 

# Clarification

A quick but important clarification: Because of how your habits are wired, the well-myelinated routine will continue to exist in your brain. This is why many alcoholics relapse after months of sobriety. This is another reason why quitting a habit cold turkey fails.

When you "break" a bad habit, what you're actually changing is the decision your basal ganglia makes. Remember in Chapter 1 when I said your basal ganglia decides to execute a routine based on how easily the reward can be obtained?

Well, "breaking" a bad habit means you're causing the basal ganglia to make a new decision \- to either avoid the old routine because it's no longer rewarding enough, or to select a modified version of that routine.

This also means it's critical that you keep yourself from slipping back into your old ways. That's what Chapter 5: Sustaining Long Term Change is all about. I've experienced letting myself slip back into my old habits like alcoholism and gaming addiction. Believe me, it's not fun. It almost destroyed my life.

How Long Will it Take?

For me personally, it took about a week to feel like I "broke" my daily habits of alcohol, junk food, and sleeping in late. After around a week, I no longer craved any of those things.

Of course, as I explained in the three examples of habits I've broken, I was aggressive in my changes. If you're gentler with your habits, they will take longer to break. Your results may vary depending on factors such as what the habit is, what the reward is, and what you're doing to break it.

Another thing to keep in mind \- as I said earlier, habits like drinking alcohol and using caffeine can have negative mental and physical effects when you stop using them as much. That's why you have to taper the reward down instead of suddenly cutting them out completely. Yes, that makes breaking the habit take longer, but it's much better for you to do it that way. Be kind to yourself\!

- # Starting good Habits

# Starting Good Habits

The best way to start a good habit is to be intentional. For optimal results, think about what the cue, craving, response, and reward of the habit loop will be, along with how much friction the response will have.

That may sound like a lot, but don't worry \- it's actually quite easy\!

Grab a fresh copy of the Habit Loop Worksheet and start filling in the six sections for a habit you'd like to start.

As an example, let's say you're trying to start a habit of going for an early-morning run.

Description

What are you trying to start a habit of? Going for an early morning run.

Cue

What will the cue for this habit be? Your alarm clock going off. Remember, a cue can be virtually anything \- an emotion, a sound, a time of day, a person, a place, a smell, etc. Be creative, but keep it simple\!

Craving

What's the reward you should crave? Anything pleasurable and/or beneficial about the morning run.

You get to enjoy the morning air, hear the birds, feel the endorphins from running, possibly see a sunrise, and improve your mental and physical health. You could also bring someone with you, and then you'd enjoy their company.

Response

How will you respond to your craving? By shutting off your alarm, getting out of bed, changing into your exercise clothes, and going outside.

Reward

What will your reward be? The one you're craving.

Friction

What kind of friction could your response have?  
• You may be too tired when you wake up  
• You'll feel the urge to snooze your alarm  
• Your workout clothes may be far away  
• Your phone and headphones may not be charged  
• You may have other things to do

How can you reduce those instances of friction?  
• Go to bed earlier  
• Put your phone on the far side of the room and disable the snooze feature  
• Lay out your workout clothes by your bed the night before  
• Put your devices on charge before you lay down  
• Set your alarm early enough to give yourself time for the run

# Next Steps

The time it takes for your new habit to actually become a habit depends on a few factors:  
• how easy the routine is (and how low the friction is)  
• how rewarding the reward is  
• how much you've already done the routine before

Here are a few tips to make sure your new habit sticks right from the start:

Make the Reward Rewarding and Immediate

It’s extremely difficult to form a habit without a reward. You have to give your brain a reason to keep the routine going \- especially if you want your autopilot to choose that routine automatically.

For habits like eating healthier, make sure you choose healthy foods you actually like. When I started eating better, I fell in love with eggs, salmon, and shrimp \- so my healthy eating habits are rewarded by those nutritious and tasty  
foods.

With habits such as exercising that don't have a tangible reward, you can still find intangible rewards for the routine. For example, you can find things you enjoy about the run \- the nice air, the endorphins, etc. \- or you can bring someone else along\!

Oh, and don't forget \- the reward has to quickly follow the routine, or else the habit probably won't stick. Think in terms of seconds to minutes, not hours or days.

Practice the Routine

Want to make things a little easier on your brain? Practice the routine of the habit you want, especially if it's something you haven't done many times before.

When I first started writing scripts for my YouTube videos, it was weird. I had never done anything like that before. But to help my brain get used to that new routine, I practiced it more than I needed to \- I'd start writing scripts for videos I didn't plan on making, just to strengthen the neural pathway of that routine.

Remember: The stronger a pathway is, the less energy it takes. The less energy a routine takes to get a reward, the more likely that the routine becomes a habit.

Keep Friction As Low As Possible

You have to set yourself up for success, especially when you first start out. One of the best ways to do that is to reduce the friction of your new habit as much as possible.

I gave some examples of reducing the friction of the habit of a morning run earlier. Here are some ways I reduced friction for my recently developed habit of eating healthier:  
• Found simple recipes I could make easily (like pan-seared salmon)  
• Going shopping once a week \- for the entire week  
• Doing meal prep for the week on Sundays  
• Keeping healthier foods in clear sight \- in the front of my fridge and pantry  
• Planning my meals (and meal timings) the day before so all I had to do was grab my pre-cooked meal or throw a quick meal together

Where to Start

If you don't know where to start, or if you don't yet believe in yourself, try this: Start with the habit of making your bed every morning. I regularly recommend this habit to people, and it's legitimately quite powerful.

Why? Because starting a habit of making your bed builds self-discipline, it builds self-confidence, and it shows you that you'll do things right even if no one else will ever see. These benefits spill over into your other habits and other areas of your life.

Keeping It Going

After the past two chapters, you now know how to break bad habits and start good ones.

Now all you need to know is how to keep those positive changes going \- and that's what the last chapter is all about\!

- # Sustaining Long-Term Change

# Keep It Going

No matter how small your habits are, they will have a massive effect on your life over time. If you let your bad habits go, they'll destroy your life and possibly kill you.

I'm not being overly dramatic here. Remember the 370lb, pre-diabetic version of Joey? Do you want to wind up like that guy? Trust me, you don't. If I hadn't changed my life, I probably wouldn't be alive right now.

But good habits work the same way. If you sustain your good habits, your life will start improving rapidly over time. That's the thing with habits \- they either help you or hurt you.

That's why you have to sustain your change for the long-term. Here are a few tips on how you can do that:

Believe in Yourself

Mindset is everything. You have to believe in yourself and your ability to change your habits. If you don't, then any positive progress you make won't last. Take it from someone who has pulled themselves out of a terrible rut \- you can change for the better. I believe in you \- now you have to believe in yourself.

Joining a group of like-minded people who are also working to change themselves can be quite helpful. Having people to share your struggles and your victories with can get you through the tough times and make your wins taste even sweeter. 

Prevent New Bad Habits

Now that you know how bad habits form, you have to stay vigilant and stop bad habits from forming in the future. I caught myself creating a bad habit a few weeks ago. Here's how it happened:

After playing tennis, I would stop at a Korean bakery on the way home and get a few pastries. This turned into a lot of extra money spent on dining out and a lot of extra calories. Thankfully, it hadn't yet become a habit yet, so it didn't take much effort to nip it in the bud. Now, my post-tennis habit is the aforementioned hot bath.

Track Your Habits \- Don't Fail Twice in a Row

In anything you try to do in life, you will fail. You'll have bad days. You won't be able to resist those Doritos in your kitchen. You won't get out of bed for your run. You'll drink too much and stay up too late. And that's okay\! It's going to happen.

Missing one day isn't a problem. Missing two days in a row is a problem. Speaking from experience, a couple missed days can easily turn into missing a week, which turns into missing three weeks, which turns into "holy crap, I've gained back 20lbs\!"

I strongly recommend you track your habits. In the course materials, there's a 28-day Habit Tracker worksheet. Print it off, keep it close to your desk, and track your habits every day. If you succeed in avoiding a bad habit or keeping up a good habit, write a check in the box for the habit for that day. If you fail, write an X.

Again, if you fail one day, it's okay. It happens to the best of us. It's part of the process. But if you start missing two or three days in a row, or if your success rate is under 50%, then you need to take some time and figure out why.

Reassess the habit loop. Readjust the response and the friction. Think about why you're failing and figure out ways you can increase your rate of success. Then, try again. Life is all about learning from your mistakes and getting a little better each time. None of us are perfect, we're all just getting better as we go.

Handle Failure the Right Way

Again, failures are part of the process. You'll have bad days. You'll have days where you don't feel like being perfect. You'll have days where you give in. What you have to keep in mind is that failures aren't what matter \- how you handle those failures is what matters.

When you slip up and give in to an old habit, you have two choices. You can either beat yourself up and spiral into a week, two weeks, a month of failures, OR you can keep your chin up and go right back to succeeding tomorrow. So when you give in and have that piece of cake or you sleep in too late, don't dwell on it. Instead, enjoy it and go right back to what you should be doing the next day. The cake was eaten and the extra sleep was had \- beating yourself up won't change that.

Automate Your Discipline

As retired Navy SEAL officer Jocko Willink says: discipline equals freedom. How? Because when you discipline yourself to do the things you know you should do, you know you can discipline yourself to do what it takes to achieve anything you want to in life. You become free because of your discipline.

Through carefully constructed habits, you can make your discipline automatic. After you've changed your habits, you won't be as reliant on willpower or motivation because your automated habit of discipline will make sure you do what you need to do.

Write a Plan

If you have several habits you want to change, write down a plan for which habits you're going to change first. Prioritize. Don't try to do everything all at once \- that's asking to fail. Focus on one or two habits at a time. Once you feel like you've broken or built one or two habits, move on to the next one or two.

When it comes to improving yourself, it takes intentionality and patience to get where you want to go. Check in with yourself on a weekly or monthly basis to see how you're doing. Adjust your plan based on where you are. Broken your habit of sleeping in late? Ready to start your habit of morning exercise? Modify your plan to account for those changes.

Checking in with yourself regularly like this will ensure you stay on track, and let you see when you're veering off course or when your progress has slowed down.

Find Your Keystone Habits

You likely have one single habit which acts as a "keystone" for many of your other habits. If you change the keystone habit, that change ripples out through those other habits. If that habit breaks, the structure around it will be sensitive to change. If that habit stays strong, the structure around it will be resistant to change.

It can take some thinking to figure out what your keystone habit is, if you have one. For years, I had a habit of thinking negatively about myself. That was the keystone for many of my other bad habits, like drinking too much, eating too much, and sleeping poorly.

Once I started thinking about myself in a more positive way, those other habits were much easier to change. Now that I'm living a healthier lifestyle, my habit of eating a healthy diet is my keystone habit for other habits, such as exercising regularly, sleeping better, and dressing nicer.

If I don't eat well for a few days, I can feel those other habits slipping a little. I make sure to keep my keystone habit strong to help those other habits stay strong as well.

# Identity Change

Many people fail to improve themselves because they focus solely on their goals.

I made this mistake for years by focusing only on reaching my goal weight of 180lbs. Why is this a problem? If you focus on a goal, you won't be happy until you reach that goal. You won't be happy with the incremental progress you make along the way.

The pounds lost, the miles ran, and the tennis matches won will mean nothing to you. You'll also be likely to go back to your old ways after you reach your goal \- if you even reach it in the first place. Ever hear people who go on a diet talk about how they can't wait to binge on cake and wine again? That's exactly the kind of thinking that causes people to gain a bunch of weight back after they've lost a lot.

Same for some people who want to run a marathon \- they train for months, run the marathon, and... they never run again.

Instead of focusing on your goals, focus instead on changing your identity. You have an identity now \- perhaps you're a smoker, you're overweight, or you're lazy \- and you're obviously unhappy with that identity, which is why you want to change your habits.

Figure out the identity you want to have \- say, you want to be a runner, you want to be healthy, or you want to be a great programmer \- then focus on changing your habits to support that new identity.

Each time you execute a habit, it's like a vote for your identity. Make sure you cast more votes for the identity you want to have, and you'll become the person you want to be. Let yourself slip for too long, and you'll be casting too few votes for the identity you want, and too many votes for the identity you don't want.

Don't get me wrong, I'm absolutely not saying you shouldn't have goals. Goals give you a direction. Without goals, you'll be lost.

What I'm saying is you should think about the identity you want to have (the person you want to be), and then create goals that will get you to where you want to be. Then, figure out how to change your  
habits to achieve those goals and become the best version of yourself.

Also, start thinking in terms of the identity you want to have. For example, if you're breaking your habit of drinking and someone offers you a frosty beer, don't say "no thanks, I'm trying to quit". Instead, say "no thanks, I'm not drinking right now."

That small change in how you say things will have a huge effect on your mentality. Don't think in terms of trying, think in terms of doing or not doing.
