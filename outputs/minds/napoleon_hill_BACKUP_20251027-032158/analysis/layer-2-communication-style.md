- Carnegie's Master Mind group → Power of Mastermind Alliance

**Effect:** Principles feel PROVEN, not theoretical. Authority by association.

### Device: Triadic Structure (Power of Three)
**Frequency:** Pervasive organizational pattern
**Examples:**
- "Conceive, Believe, Achieve"
- "Desire, Faith, Persistence"
- "Specialized Knowledge, Imagination, Organized Planning"

**Pattern:** Complex ideas organized in threes for retention
**Effect:** Memorable, balanced, complete-feeling

### Device: Call-and-Response Rhythm
