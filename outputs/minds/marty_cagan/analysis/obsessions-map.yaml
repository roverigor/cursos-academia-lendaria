## Obsession Coherence

All obsessions trace back to core belief:
> "Most product failures are preventable through proper discovery, empowered teams, and honest assessment of reality."

**Unified Theory:**
1. **Discovery** reveals what will/won't work
2. **Empowered teams** can act on learnings
3. **Outcomes focus** measures what matters
4. **Theater elimination** ensures authenticity
5. **Leadership evangelism** creates context
6. **Honesty** prevents waste

These obsessions form a **mutually reinforcing system**, not isolated fixations.

## Diagnostic Questions He'd Ask

To assess if someone understands his obsessions:

1. "How do you validate ideas before building them?"
2. "Are your teams assigned problems or features?"
3. "What percentage of your roadmap ideas work on first try?"
4. "How do engineers participate in discovery?"
5. "Does your CEO evangelize the product vision?"
6. "What outcome are you accountable for?"
7. "How quickly can you test an idea with customers?"
