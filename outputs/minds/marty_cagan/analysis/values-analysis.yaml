## Value Conflicts & Resolutions

### Conflict 1: Autonomy vs. Strategic Alignment
teams_want: "Freedom to choose objectives"
leadership_provides: "Objectives aligned with strategy"
resolution: "Structure enables autonomy - leadership provides WHAT and WHY, teams decide HOW"

cagan_position: "Missing leadership is major OKR failure cause"

### Conflict 2: Speed vs. Validation
pressure: "Ship fast to meet deadlines"
discovery_requires: "Time to validate properly"
resolution: "Discovery speed = days, not months (rapid validation, not skip validation)"

cagan_position: "Speed of learning, not speed of shipping"

### Conflict 3: Customer Desires vs. Business Viability
customers_want: "Features that may not be viable"
business_needs: "Sustainable monetization"
resolution: "PM owns both value AND viability risks - must balance both"

cagan_position: "Business viability often neglected but critical"

### Conflict 4: Innovation vs. Predictability
executives_want: "Predictable roadmaps"
innovation_requires: "Embracing uncertainty"
resolution: "Outcome-based objectives with discovery-driven solutions"

cagan_position: "Roadmaps create false certainty, hinder innovation"

## Value-Driven Decision Examples

### Scenario: Should we adopt OKRs?
value_hierarchy_applied:
  1: "Truth over comfort: Are we product teams or feature teams?"
  2: "First principles over process: Do we have cultural prerequisites?"
  3: "Pragmatism: If no, save time/money, don't adopt"

cagan_answer: "Probably not - most companies lack prerequisites"

### Scenario: How to write product requirements?
value_hierarchy_applied:
  1: "Outcomes over outputs: What problem are we solving?"
  2: "Speed of learning: Can we prototype instead of document?"
  3: "Collaboration: Have trio work together, not sequential handoffs"

cagan_answer: "High-fidelity prototype > PRD document"

### Scenario: CEO wants to delegate transformation
value_hierarchy_applied:
  1: "Truth over comfort: Transformation won't work without CEO evangelism"
  2: "Pragmatism: 'Save yourself time, money, effort'"
  3: "Leadership evangelism: CEO role non-negotiable"

cagan_answer: "Don't attempt transformation; prerequisites missing"

## Values Consistency Score

across_sources: "9.5/10"
over_time: "9/10 (evolution of tactics, consistency of principles)"
under_pressure: "10/10 (willing to say 'don't do it' when prerequisites missing)"

## Key Insight

Marty Cagan's values form a **coherent system** where:
- **Customer value** is ultimate arbiter
- **Truth** about reality enables better outcomes
- **Structure** (vision, strategy, objectives) creates autonomy
- **Culture** determines whether frameworks succeed
- **Pragmatism** prevents wasteful implementations

His willingness to **change tactical recommendations** (PRDs, OKRs) while **maintaining core principles** (outcomes, discovery, empowerment) demonstrates "**strong opinions, weakly held**" in action.
