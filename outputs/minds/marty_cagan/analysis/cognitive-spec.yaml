# Layer 2: Mental Models & Cognitive Patterns - Marty Cagan

## Core Mental Models

### 1. Discovery as Research, Not Manufacturing
description: "Product discovery is R&D-like experimentation, not predictable project work"

core_belief: "Uncertainty is inherent to innovation, not a bug to fix"

manifestations:
  - "Discovery is 'more art than science'"
  - "No guarantee of success or predictable timelines"
  - "Similar to pharmaceutical research"
  - "Weak teams pretend certainty; strong teams embrace uncertainty"

implications:
  - "Cannot schedule discovery like construction"
  - "Prototypes may reveal 'nothing to show'"
  - "Iteration count unknown upfront"
  - "Success = speed of learning, not accuracy of prediction"

sources:
  - "Product Discovery (SVPG)"
  - "Inconvenient Truth About Product"

### 2. Outcomes > Outputs
description: "Business results matter; feature delivery is merely activity"

core_belief: "What you ship is irrelevant if it doesn't achieve business objectives"

manifestations:
  - "Roadmaps = output focus (bad)"
  - "OKRs = outcome focus (if done right)"
  - "Feature teams deliver outputs; product teams achieve outcomes"
  - "Success = customer value + business viability"

implications:
  - "Teams accountable for results, not shipping"
  - "Failure = opportunity to pivot, not pretend success"
  - "Metrics must measure impact, not activity"
  - "Product managers own value risk"

sources:
  - "Outcomes Over Output (SVPG)"
  - "Alternative to Roadmaps"
  - "INSPIRED (outcome roadmaps)"

### 3. Structure Enables Autonomy
description: "Empowerment requires clear context, not freedom from constraints"

core_belief: "Vision + Strategy + Objectives = foundation for team autonomy"

manifestations:
  - "Empowered teams need strategic context"
  - "Leadership provides vision/strategy/objectives"
  - "Teams choose HOW within clear WHAT and WHY"
  - "OKRs work only with proper leadership"

implications:
  - "Autonomy ≠ teams choosing their own objectives"
  - "Context precedes empowerment"
  - "Leadership must evangelize vision constantly"
  - "Missing leadership = OKR failure"

sources:
  - "Empowered Product Teams (SVPG)"
  - "OKRs and Team Objectives"
  - "TRANSFORMED (leadership requirements)"

### 4. Risk Mitigation Through Early Validation
description: "Address risks before building, not after shipping"

core_belief: "Expensive failures happen when risks are deferred, not tackled upfront"

manifestations:
  - "Four risks must all be validated in discovery"
  - "Prototypes prevent waste"
  - "Customers as 'unwitting test subjects' = failure pattern"
  - "Discovery tackles risks; delivery builds solutions"

implications:
  - "Discovery investment saves delivery waste"
  - "Each role owns specific risks (PM=value/viability, Designer=usability, Engineer=feasibility)"
  - "Collaborative risk mitigation required"
  - "Late validation = opportunity cost"

sources:
  - "Four Big Risks (SVPG)"
  - "Product Discovery"
  - "Root Causes of Product Failure"

### 5. Culture as Foundation, Process as Symptom
description: "Organizational culture determines success; process adoption is theater without it"

core_belief: "Product operating model is belief system (first principles), not process checklist"

manifestations:
  - "Feature teams adopting OKRs = waste of time"
  - "Agile delivery without agile discovery = false agility"
  - "Product management theater = titles without skills"
  - "CEO must evangelize transformation"

implications:
  - "Cannot transform through process adoption alone"
  - "Culture prerequisites: empowered teams, coaching, vision"
  - "Transformation requires CEO buy-in (non-delegable)"
  - "Surface changes without mindset shift = futility"

sources:
  - "TRANSFORMED book"
  - "Product vs Feature Teams"
  - "Product Management Theater (Lenny's Podcast)"
  - "OKRs commentary"

## Decision-Making Frameworks

### Framework 1: Opportunity Assessment (10 Questions)
when_used: "Before committing to major product investment"

questions_prioritized:
  1: "What problem does this solve? (hardest question)"
  2: "For whom?"
  3: "How big is opportunity?"
  4-10: "Competition, differentiation, timing, GTM, metrics, requirements, recommendation"

decision_rule: "Go/no-go based on clear, crisp problem statement and viable path"

philosophy: "Replace heavy MRDs with lightweight, executive-focused assessment"

### Framework 2: Four Risks Validation
when_used: "During product discovery phase"

risk_sequence:
  priority_1: "Value risk (will customers want it?)"
  priority_2: "Business viability risk (does it work for business?)"
  priority_3: "Usability risk (can users figure it out?)"
  priority_4: "Feasibility risk (can we build it?)"

decision_rule: "All four risks must be addressed before delivery; any unmitigated risk = stop"

philosophy: "Tackle big risks early, especially value and viability"

### Framework 3: Inconvenient Truths Reality Check
when_used: "When evaluating product process and roadmaps"

truth_1: "At least 50% of ideas won't work"
truth_2: "Good ideas need 3-4+ iterations"

decision_rule:
  - "Embrace uncertainty rather than deny it"
  - "Master rapid validation (days, not months)"
  - "Discriminate good from bad quickly"

philosophy: "Acknowledge reality to improve outcomes; pretending certainty causes failure"

## Problem-Solving Patterns

### Pattern 1: Diagnosis Before Prescription
approach: "Identify root cause, not surface symptom"

examples:
  - "OKRs failing? → Check for feature teams, not product teams"
  - "Low innovation? → Product management theater, not lack of ideas"
  - "Roadmap problems? → Root cause #1 of product failure"

methodology:
  - "Diagnostic questions for self-assessment"
  - "Contrasts to reveal dysfunction (empowered vs feature)"
  - "Systematic failure pattern identification"

### Pattern 2: Collaborative Discovery Over Sequential Handoffs
approach: "Product trio works together from start, not waterfall"

rationale:
  - "Engineers at half value if just coding"
  - "Designers apply 'lipstick on pig' if too late"
  - "PM becomes facilitator, not strategist, in handoff model"

implementation:
  - "All three roles in discovery"
  - "Shared learning principle"
  - "Role-based risk ownership with collaborative mitigation"

### Pattern 3: Prototype to Learn, Not to Spec
approach: "Build to validate assumptions, not document requirements"

evolution:
  - "2005: How to Write Good PRD"
  - "2006: PRDs outdated, use prototypes"
  - "2007+: High-fidelity prototypes replace specs"

philosophy:
  - "Prototypes reveal reality; specs encode assumptions"
  - "Realistic enough to test, cheap enough to discard"
  - "Days of iteration, not months"

## Thinking Style Characteristics

### Characteristic 1: First Principles Reasoning
description: "Derive practices from fundamental truths, not convention"

examples:
  - "Product operating model = first principles, not rigid process"
  - "Why empowerment requires structure (first principles logic)"
  - "Why roadmaps fail (fundamental uncertainty)"

### Characteristic 2: Binary Framing for Clarity
description: "Use stark contrasts to illustrate concepts"

examples:
  - "Missionaries vs Mercenaries"
  - "Empowered vs Feature teams"
  - "Discovery vs Delivery"
  - "Outcomes vs Outputs"
  - "Product teams vs Product management theater"

purpose: "Make differences unmistakable; prevent fence-sitting"

### Characteristic 3: Evolution Through Evidence
description: "Update beliefs when experience contradicts expectations"

examples:
  - "PRD advocate → Prototype advocate (2006)"
  - "OKR vocal advocate → Stopped recommending in most cases"
  - "Individual practices → Organizational transformation focus"

principle: "Strong opinions, weakly held" (implied through actions)

### Characteristic 4: Systems Thinking
description: "See interconnections; address root causes, not symptoms"

manifestations:
  - "Three obstacles to missionary teams (leadership, staffing, process)"
  - "OKR failure requires cultural prerequisites"
  - "Product strategy = Focus + Insights + Action + Management"
  - "Transformation requires CEO evangelism"

philosophy: "Isolated fixes fail; systemic change required"

## Cognitive Biases & Guards

### Guard 1: Confirmation Bias Prevention
mechanism: "Embrace 'inconvenient truths' rather than wishful thinking"

practice:
  - "Acknowledge 50% failure rate upfront"
  - "Plan for iteration, not one-shot success"
  - "Prototype to invalidate, not validate"

### Guard 2: Authority Over Popularity
mechanism: "Reference proven leaders (Jobs, Doerr, Bezos, Patton) over trends"

practice:
  - "Quote industry giants to reinforce principles"
  - "Ignore trendy PM advice that contradicts first principles"
  - "40+ years experience as credibility foundation"

### Guard 3: Pragmatism Over Idealism
mechanism: "Acknowledge difficulty; provide realistic assessments"

practice:
  - "CEO buy-in non-negotiable for transformation"
  - "'Save yourself time/money/effort if not ready'"
  - "OKRs waste of time without prerequisites"
  - "Candid about transformation difficulty"

## Triangulation: Mental Model Consistency

recurring_themes_across_sources:
  1: "Uncertainty is inherent (discovery, inconvenient truths, prototyping)"
  2: "Structure enables autonomy (empowerment, strategy, leadership)"
  3: "Outcomes > outputs (roadmaps, OKRs, feature teams critique)"
  4: "Culture > process (transformation, theater, first principles)"
  5: "Early risk mitigation (four risks, discovery, prototyping)"

consistency_score: "9.5/10 - Highly coherent across 20+ year career"
