## Overview

Marty Cagan's framework helps product managers evaluate new product opportunities before committing resources, addressing the gap between intuition-based decisions and thorough analysis.

## The Ten Core Questions

The framework requires answering these fundamental questions:

1. **Problem Definition**: "Exactly what problem will this solve? (value proposition)"
2. **Target Market**: "For whom do we solve that problem?"
3. **Market Size**: "How big is the opportunity?"
4. **Competition**: "What alternatives are out there? (competitive landscape)"
5. **Differentiation**: "Why are we best suited to pursue this?"
6. **Timing**: "Why now? (market window)"
7. **Go-to-Market**: "How will we get this product to market?"
8. **Success Metrics**: "How will we measure success/make money from this product?"
9. **Critical Requirements**: "What factors are critical to success?"
10. **Recommendation**: "Given the above, what's the recommendation? (go or no-go)"

## Key Methodology Points

**Most Challenging Element:** The first question proves surprisingly difficult—most product managers "get a rambling list of features and capabilities, rather than the a crisp, clear and compelling statement."

**Market Sizing Approach:** Use industry analysts, trade associations, finance staff, and bottom-up calculations while remaining conservative.

**Go-to-Market Importance:** This strategy "can have very significant impact on the product requirements" and deserves special attention.

**Solution Requirements:** Document constraints and dependencies discovered during investigation (partnerships, extensibility needs, branding requirements).

## Usage & Format

**When to Use:** Before major product investments; even when executives have already decided to proceed

**Output:** A lightweight assessment presented to senior management for a clear go/no-go decision

**Philosophy:** Replace heavy Market Requirements Documents with quick, effective evaluation that informs without creating bureaucratic overhead.
