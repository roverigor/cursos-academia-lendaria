## Key Structural Differences

**Product Teams** are cross-functional units (product, design, engineering) focused on solving customer problems with measurable outcomes. They operate with genuine empowerment to discover solutions collaboratively.

**Feature Teams** receive prioritized feature lists and roadmaps from stakeholders. While structurally similar to product teams, they lack true decision-making authority and operate primarily as delivery vehicles.

## Responsibility Distribution

In empowered product teams, accountability divides clearly: the product manager ensures value and business viability; designers handle usability; engineers manage feasibility. This creates what Cagan calls "intense, give and take" collaboration.

Feature teams distribute accountability differently. Stakeholders requesting features implicitly own responsibility for value and viability, yet they typically "blame the team if results aren't realized." The product manager becomes "a form of facilitator" rather than a strategic leader.

## Why Feature Teams Underperform

Feature teams struggle because:

- **Designer gaps:** Companies often employ graphic designers rather than "true product designers" skilled in interaction design and user research
- **PM role confusion:** Product managers become project managers and unskilled designers simultaneously
- **Talent exodus:** Strong engineers and designers leave for empowered environments where they can "practice their craft"
- **Limited innovation:** The model prioritizes output over discovering what customers actually need

## Diagnostic Indicators

Organizations can identify their model by asking:

- Are teams assigned problems or prioritized features?
- Is there role confusion between PM, designer, and delivery manager?
- Does the PM spend time on project management rather than strategy?
- Do OKR implementations devolve into "contrived mashups of outcomes and features"?

## Organizational Implications

Cagan argues that truly empowered product teams characterize the best companies, yet many organizations adopt surface-level changes—creating feature teams—while believing they've transformed. This perpetuates what he calls "the futility" of real innovation, leaving significant talent underutilized across the industry.

## Analysis Notes

**Communication Style:**
- Harsh but honest assessment
- Uses diagnostic questions
- Acknowledges widespread organizational confusion

**Core Critique:**
- Transformation theater vs. real change
- Talent waste through organizational dysfunction
- Surface adoption of frameworks (OKRs) without mindset shift

**Implicit Values:**
- Craftsmanship matters
- Role clarity enables collaboration
- Outcomes > outputs
- Authenticity > appearances
