## Overview

TRANSFORMED was written to bridge the gap between where most companies are right now and where they need to be, answering the common question: **"Can traditional companies actually transform to the product model?"**

Third book in the trilogy: INSPIRED → EMPOWERED → TRANSFORMED

## The Product Operating Model Definition

The Product Operating Model is **not a rigid process or a single methodology**. Instead, it is a **conceptual model based on a set of first principles** that the best product companies believe to be true.

## Key Concepts

The book covers several foundational product model concepts:

**Five Core Areas:**
1. **Product Teams** - Cross-functional, empowered teams
2. **Product Strategy** - How to accomplish vision
3. **Product Discovery** - Validating before building
4. **Product Delivery** - Building and shipping
5. **Product Culture** - Environment for success

All concepts align under these five pillars.

## Critical Elements

The book addresses:
- The critical core product concepts that power the product model
- The set of product first principles that you need to get right
- Tools and techniques for adopting and managing the required changes
- How to assess, plan, and execute a successful transformation

## Leadership Requirements

**CEO as Chief Evangelist:**

"The CEO needs to be viewed as the **chief evangelist for the product model**. If this is something your CEO is unwilling or unable to do, then you can likely save yourself a lot of time, money, and effort by reassessing your readiness."

## Transformation Approach

Cagan candidly talks about the process of transforming an organization from:
- **Legacy org** → Product operating model
- **Feature-driven org** → Product operating model
- **Sales-driven org** → Product operating model
