## The Four Risk Categories

Marty Cagan identifies four distinct types of risk that product teams must address:

1. **Value Risk**: Whether customers will purchase or choose to use the product
2. **Usability Risk**: Whether users can effectively figure out how to use it
3. **Feasibility Risk**: Whether engineers can build the solution with available time, skills, and technology
4. **Business Viability Risk**: Whether the solution works across various business dimensions

## Why These Matter

The original framework of "valuable, usable, and feasible" obscured critical business considerations. Cagan notes that "business value (viability) risks can be substantial" and are frequently underestimated or avoided by product managers who focus too heavily on customer value alone.

Business viability encompasses:
- Go-to-market strategy
- Sales channels
- Partner contracts
- Legal compliance
- Customer acquisition costs
- Monetization potential
- Brand alignment

## Role-Based Accountability

Each team member owns specific risks:

- **Product Manager**: Value and viability risks; accountable for outcomes
- **Product Designer**: Usability risk; accountable for user experience
- **Lead Engineer**: Feasibility risk; accountable for delivery

## When to Address These Risks

Strong product teams "tackle the big risks *early*—especially value risk and business risk," rather than deferring them. This approach emphasizes collaborative problem-solving across engineering, design, and product before significant development investment.

## Analysis Notes

**Framework Evolution:**
- Evolved from 3 risks to 4 (added viability)
- Acknowledges PM tendency to neglect business constraints

**Role Clarity:**
- Clear ownership model
- Distributed accountability
- Collaborative risk mitigation

**Timing Philosophy:**
- Early > Late
- Discovery tackles risks before delivery
- Prevention > remediation

**Communication Pattern:**
- Definitional framework
- Acknowledges common blind spots
- Emphasizes what's often missed (viability)
