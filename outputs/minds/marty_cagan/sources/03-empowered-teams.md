## Definition and Core Purpose

Empowered teams exist fundamentally differently than traditional organizational units. Rather than serving as tools to execute business directives, they are chartered to "serve the customers, in ways that meet the needs of the business." This distinction profoundly shapes team motivation, autonomy, and innovation outcomes.

## Key Characteristics

**Composition and Staffing**
Teams require competent people of strong character across essential disciplines: product management, design, and engineering. The emphasis shifts from "cultural fit" hiring (which often perpetuates homogeneity) to selecting diverse thinkers who are skilled and collaborative—what the author calls filtering out problematic individuals rather than filtering for similarity.

**Problem-Based Work**
The fundamental shift involves assigning teams meaningful problems to solve rather than feature lists to execute. Teams gain authority to determine implementation approaches while remaining accountable for business outcomes rather than output metrics.

**Autonomy with Context**
True empowerment requires leadership providing clear strategic direction—vision, strategy, principles, and priorities—while management offers coaching support. Within this framework, teams independently choose solutions.

## Critical Organizational Requirements

**Leadership Responsibilities:** Establishing compelling vision, communicating strategy, and maintaining momentum through consistent evangelism

**Management Roles:** Staffing teams with competent people, providing weekly coaching, and assigning clear quarterly objectives

**Cultural Foundation:** Trust built through demonstrated competence and character, combined with hiring for diverse perspectives rather than conformity

## Core Philosophy

The philosophy rests on recognizing that "ordinary people" with proper context and support achieve extraordinary results.

## Analysis Notes

**Key Paradox:** Structure (vision, strategy, objectives) creates autonomy (solution freedom)

**Value Hierarchy:**
1. Customer value
2. Business outcomes
3. Team autonomy
4. Diverse perspectives

**Mental Model:** Teams as problem-solvers, not feature-builders

**Communication Pattern:** Defines by contrast (empowered vs command-control)
