## Discovery Framework - Four Big Risks

Marty Cagan identifies four big risks in product management:

1. **Value risk** - Whether customers will buy it or users will choose to use it
2. **Usability risk** - Whether users can figure out how to use it
3. **Feasibility risk** - Whether our engineers can build what we need with the time, skills, and technology we have
4. **Business viability risk** - Whether this solution also works for the various aspects of our business

## Customer Interviews & User Research

**Purpose:** Customer interviews are needed to understand your customer, to get rid of assumptions and start working with facts.

**Shared Learning:** The key is **shared learning**. Unless the **actual product team—the PM, the product designer, and the engineers—learns the issues firsthand**, they will not act on those learnings.

**Organizational Approach:** Cagan advocates a compromise that is used at many strong product companies. These companies have a **relatively small number of professional user researchers** to **coach and enable the product teams** to do good product discovery work every week.

## Discovery Techniques

Some useful tools and techniques include:
- User research
- Focus groups
- Observation
- Customer interviews
- Data analytics
- Competitive research
- Empathy mapping

There are **qualitative techniques, quantitative techniques**, and many different techniques that contribute to discovery.

Cagan categorizes techniques by **product discovery phase**:
1. **Framing**
2. **Planning**
3. **Ideation**
4. **Prototyping**
5. **Testing**

## Customer Discovery Programs

Customer discovery programs allow you to work on an important problem closely with a group of customers.

**Cagan's guidance:** From his experience, identify **at least 6 reference customers**.

## Analysis Notes

**Organizational Model:**
- Small core of professional researchers
- Researchers as coaches/enablers
- Product teams do discovery weekly
- Shared learning principle

**Research Philosophy:**
- Facts > assumptions
- Firsthand learning required
- Team learns together
- Multiple technique types (qual + quant)

**Phased Approach:**
- Structured progression through phases
- Each phase has specific techniques
- From framing to testing

**Key Principle:**
- Product teams must learn firsthand
- Can't delegate customer understanding
- Research team enables, not replaces
