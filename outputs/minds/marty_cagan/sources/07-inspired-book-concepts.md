## Overview

INSPIRED (2017 - Second Edition) by Marty Cagan is a guide for product managers focusing on creating successful digital products, providing a master class in how to structure and staff a vibrant and successful product organization.

## Core Principles

The best product teams have three overarching principles:

1. **Risks are tackled up front** - Don't wait until after launch
2. **Products are defined and designed collaboratively** - Not sequentially
3. **It's about solving problems, not implementing features** - Outcome focus

### Key Risk Categories

Teams must address four types of risks:

- **Value risk** - Whether customers will buy it
- **Usability risk** - Whether users can figure out how to use it
- **Feasibility risk** - Whether engineers can build it
- **Business viability risk** - Whether the solution works with all aspects of business

## Major Concepts

### Product Discovery vs. Delivery

The author emphasizes the roles of discovery (product discovery) and delivery phases, which are mutually permeable.

Cagan advocates for validating ideas early through discovery work before development to avoid wasting resources, involving prototyping, testing, and iterating based on feedback.

### Empowered Product Teams

The most important concept is having an empowered product team of **missionaries rather than mercenaries** that produce outputs dictated by others - they need to be a group of missionaries for the product they are responsible for.

### Product Manager Role

The responsibility of the product manager is to discover a product that delivers value to customers and facilitates its development, **not just define product requirements.**

### Roadmaps and Outcomes

The alternative to traditional roadmaps are **"outcome roadmaps"** that define expected business outcomes, where delivery time is a secondary factor.
