## Marty Cagan's Evolved Position on OKRs

**Important Context:** After many years of being a very vocal advocate for the OKR (Objectives and Key Results) technique, in the majority of companies Marty Cagan meets, **he has stopped recommending the practice**.

In many companies, even though conceptually the technique is simple and sound, it ends up proving **a waste of time and effort, and yields little if any results**.

## Three Fundamental Problems

Most companies are not set up to effectively apply this technique. Cagan identifies three main reasons:

### 1. Feature Teams vs. Product Teams
If the company is still using **feature teams**, as most unfortunately are, then the OKR technique is going to be a **cultural mismatch**, and almost certainly prove a waste of time and effort.

### 2. Manager's Objectives vs. Product Team Objectives
In many companies, each manager creates their own organizational objectives, which are then cascaded down to their employees. This creates dysfunction.

### 3. Missing Leadership
In the vast majority of companies struggling to get value out of OKRs, the **role of leadership is largely missing in action** - they think the idea is to let teams identify objectives and pursue them.

## How OKRs Should Work

The essential point of team objectives is to **empower a team by giving them a problem to solve rather than a feature to build** and ensuring they have the necessary strategic context.

**OKRs are first and foremost an empowerment technique** - the main idea is to give product teams real problems to solve, and then to give the teams the space to solve them.

## Analysis Notes

**Evolution of Thinking:**
- Was vocal advocate
- Now has stopped recommending in most cases
- "Strong opinions, weakly held" in action

**Prerequisites for Success:**
- Must have product teams (not feature teams)
- Leadership must provide objectives (not teams)
- Strategic context required

**Key Insight:**
- OKRs = empowerment technique
- Not goal-setting framework per se
- Cultural foundation required

**Communication Pattern:**
- Honest about changing position
- Acknowledges widespread failure
- Identifies systemic root causes
- Pragmatic: "waste of time" if prerequisites missing

**Philosophical Consistency:**
- Outcomes > outputs (maintained)
- Problems > features (maintained)
- Empowerment requires structure (maintained)
- But tool adoption without culture = theater
