## Product Vision & Evangelism

Marty Cagan emphasizes that **evangelism should be continuous and relentless**, stating:

> "There is no such thing as overcommunicating when it comes to explaining and selling the vision."

## Product Leader's Role

Product leaders should focus on:
- Coaching teams
- Setting product vision and strategy
- Being **"a strong, persuasive storyteller so that the CEO feels like it's her or his product vision"**

While the **head of product is responsible for the product vision**, it's important that key leaders, starting with the CEO, feel real ownership over it, as they will need to evangelize this vision to:
- Investors
- Board members
- Other leaders
- Prospective customers

## CEO's Role in Evangelism

In Marty Cagan's book "TRANSFORMED," he states that **the CEO needs to be the chief evangelist for the product model** and **cannot delegate the transformation**.

The larger the organization, the more essential it is to be very good at evangelism, and leaders must understand that evangelism is **never "done"** - it needs to be **constant**.

## Evangelism as Leadership Responsibility

Leaders need to **preach and share the vision to convert people to be true believers**, with evangelism being a **huge non-stop responsibility** in a large company.

## Vision vs. Strategy

The difference between vision and strategy is analogous to the difference between good leadership and good management:
- **Leadership inspires and sets the direction** (vision)
- **Management helps get there** (strategy)

## Analysis Notes

**Key Metaphor:** Evangelism
- Religious connotation (believers, conversion)
- Never-ending responsibility
- "No such thing as overcommunicating"

**Ownership Paradox:**
- Head of product creates vision
- But CEO must feel ownership
- Product leader as "strong, persuasive storyteller"
- Make others feel it's their vision

**Leadership Philosophy:**
- Vision = leadership domain
- Strategy = management domain
- Evangelism = constant, not one-time
- CEO must be chief evangelist (non-delegable)

**Transformation Context:**
- Product model transformation requires CEO buy-in
- Without CEO evangelism, transformation will fail
- Cultural change needs top-down advocacy

**Communication Pattern:**
- Absolutist language ("no such thing as overcommunicating")
- Non-negotiable requirements (CEO evangelism)
- Emotional language (believers, convert, inspire)
- Process discipline (constant, never done)
