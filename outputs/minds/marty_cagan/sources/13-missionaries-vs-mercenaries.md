# Missionaries vs. Mercenaries

**Source:** https://www.svpg.com/missionaries-vs-mercenaries
**Type:** Core Philosophy
**Collected:** 2025-10-30
**Quality:** High - Direct from SVPG

## Core Concept

Marty Cagan draws on John Doerr's famous assertion that organizations need **"teams of missionaries, not teams of mercenaries"** to succeed in product development.

## Key Definitions

**Missionary Teams** possess:
- Deep engagement and motivation
- Strong understanding of business context
- Genuine empathy for customers
- Sense of empowerment and accountability
- Passion for solving problems
- Real connection with users

**Mercenary Teams** exhibit:
- Lack of empowerment or accountability
- Absence of passion for the problem
- Limited customer connection
- Tendency to simply follow directives

## Why It Matters

According to Cagan, "**there's simply no comparison between the morale, speed and most importantly, the results, of a team of missionaries as compared with a team of mercenaries.**"

## Three Obstacles to Missionary Teams

1. **Leadership**: Executives wanting compliance rather than discussion, then blaming teams for poor results

2. **Staffing**: Inheriting mercenary-minded employees or relying on outsourced contractors (which inherently prevents missionary behavior)

3. **Process**: Development frameworks predicated on command-and-control models rather than autonomy

## Building Missionary Teams Requires

- Educating leadership on best practices
- Raising hiring standards for product managers, designers, and engineers
- Establishing durable, cross-functional product teams
- Implementing compelling product vision
- Establishing measurable business outcomes (OKRs)

## Analysis Notes

**Key Metaphor:** Missionaries vs. Mercenaries
- One of Cagan's most memorable frameworks
- Binary framing (missionary/mercenary)
- Borrowed from John Doerr (authority borrowing)

**Causality Model:**
- Results stem from team mindset
- Environment shapes mindset
- Leadership/staffing/process create environment

**Implicit Critique:**
- Contractors as structural barrier
- Command-and-control processes
- Leadership wanting compliance

**Values Hierarchy:**
- Passion > Compliance
- Empowerment > Control
- Results > Morale > Speed (in that order)
