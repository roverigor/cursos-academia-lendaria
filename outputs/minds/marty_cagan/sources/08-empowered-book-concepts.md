## Core Philosophy

The real advantage successful tech companies have is not who they hire, but **how they enable their people to work together** to solve hard problems and create extraordinary products.

Leadership is about recognizing that there's a greatness in everyone, and your job is to create an environment where that greatness can emerge.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Empowered Product Teams vs. Feature Teams

**Empowered Product Teams** are teams empowered to solve customer problems in ways that work for the business.

Instead of working on features (output), they are held accountable for solving customer problems, and the team is able to decide the best way to solve the problems they have been assigned.

### 2. Coaching

Coaching is what turns ordinary people into extraordinary product teams.

Every person on a product team should know who is specifically assigned to help them develop and reach their full potential.

### 3. Product Discovery

The book introduces a structured approach to product discovery, involving:
- Customer research
- Problem definition
- Validation

### 4. Product Vision and Strategy

The product vision states how you plan to deliver on the company mission by developing a specific product.

**A good product vision:**
- Inspires
- Compels

### 5. Meaningful Metrics

The book advocates for using meaningful metrics to measure product success and guide decision-making through key performance indicators aligned with business objectives and customer outcomes.

### 6. The Role of Technology

In strong product companies, **technology is not an expense, it is the business**, enabling and powering the products and services provided to customers.
