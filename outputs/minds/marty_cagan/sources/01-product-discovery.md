## Definition

Product discovery is the creative phase where teams validate both market opportunity and product solutions before engineering builds for production. Cagan emphasizes it's fundamentally "more art than science" rather than a predictable, scheduled phase.

## Key Principles

**Two Critical Discoveries Required:**
1. Validate that real customers want the product (market opportunity)
2. Design a solution that is usable, useful, and feasible

**Core Philosophy:**
> "you need to discover whether there are real users out there that want this product"

The process acknowledges inherent uncertainty—there's no guarantee of success or predictable timelines, similar to pharmaceutical research.

## Process Steps

1. **Opportunity Assessment** - Understand the problem
2. **User Research** - Interview real users about their needs
3. **Prototyping** - Build interactive mockups (not production code)
4. **User Testing** - Validate prototype assumptions with customers
5. **Iterate** - Adjust based on learnings before engineering begins

## Common Mistakes

**The Sequential Trap:**
Organizations schedule discovery like construction projects, expecting predictable outcomes. When prototypes reveal problems, teams ignore findings and proceed to engineering anyway, using customers as "unwitting test subjects" for expensive prototypes.

**Resource Misallocation:**
Management fears engineers sitting idle, so they deploy full engineering teams to build prototypes through multiple release cycles—wasting resources and delaying viable products by 12-24 months.

## Discovery vs. Delivery

| Discovery | Delivery |
|-----------|----------|
| Creative, unpredictable | Engineered, scheduled |
| Uses small prototyping teams | Engages full engineering |
| Validates before building | Builds validated solutions |
| May reveal "nothing to show" | Always ships something |

## Key Terminology

- **Product Discovery** - preferred over "requirements and design" to emphasize learning
- **Prototype** - low-fidelity validation tool, not production software
- **Usable, Useful, Feasible** - the three attributes success requires

## Analysis Notes

**Communication Style:** Direct, pragmatic, uses stark contrasts to make points
**Mental Model:** Discovery as research/experimentation, not manufacturing
**Value Emphasis:** Preventing waste > completing scheduled work
**Philosophical Position:** Embraces uncertainty as inherent to innovation
