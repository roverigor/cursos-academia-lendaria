## The Problem with Traditional Roadmaps

Cagan argues that conventional roadmaps function like command-and-control management, telling teams *what* to build rather than *why*. He contends that roadmaps often present prioritized feature lists without explicit business problems or clear understanding of underlying objectives. This approach, he suggests, creates significant waste because features may not actually solve their intended problems.

He invokes General George Patton's wisdom: *"Don't tell people what to do; tell them what you need accomplished, and you'll be amazed at the results."*

## Cagan's Recommended Alternative

Rather than feature-based roadmaps, Cagan advocates providing teams with **context and intent** through two components:

1. **Product Vision**: A holistic organizational direction
2. **Business Objectives**: Specific, prioritized objectives for each team

He emphasizes using the **OKR (Objectives and Key Results) system**, where management defines *what* outcomes are needed and *how* success will be measured, then empowers teams to determine *how* to achieve them.

## Key Differences

This model shifts focus from **output to outcome**. Teams remain accountable for actual business results, not just feature delivery. When initial approaches fail, teams pivot rather than pretend success. This autonomy-based approach reportedly increases team motivation and flexibility compared to traditional roadmap execution.

## Analysis Notes

**Communication Pattern:**
- Uses authority quotes (Patton)
- Command-control vs. empowerment framing
- Waste prevention argument

**Mental Model:**
- Outcomes > outputs
- Intent-based leadership
- Flexibility > predictability

**Implicit Critique:**
- Traditional PM practice as wasteful
- Feature obsession blinds to real problems
- Predictability theater hurts innovation
