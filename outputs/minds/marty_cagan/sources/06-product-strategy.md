## Definition

Product strategy answers: **"How do we make the product vision a reality, while meeting the needs of the company as we go?"**

It represents the overall approach and rationale for accomplishing organizational goals—distinct from tactical details or strategic objectives.

## Core Components

Cagan identifies four essential elements:

1. **Focus** – Making tough choices about what truly matters, concentrating resources on critical few objectives rather than pursuing 50+ initiatives simultaneously.

2. **Insights** – Generating understanding through study, data analysis, and customer learning about market dynamics, capabilities, competitive landscape, and customer needs.

3. **Action** – Converting insights into concrete decisions about which product teams pursue which objectives, equipped with strategic context.

4. **Management** – Active, engaged leadership that monitors progress, removes obstacles, facilitates collaboration, and adapts as circumstances change.

## Relationship to Vision & Execution

- **Vision** = What you want to achieve (the goal)
- **Strategy** = How you'll accomplish it (the approach)
- **Tactics** = Specific details of execution (roadmap items)

Within product teams:
- **Strategy** determines which problems to solve
- **Discovery** determines how to solve them
- **Delivery** builds the solution

## Creating Effective Strategy

Requires overcoming organizational resistance through:
- Willingness to make difficult choices
- Conducting serious thinking and study
- Committing genuine effort
- Moving beyond feature-driven work to outcome-focused problem-solving
