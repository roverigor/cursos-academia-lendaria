# Product Trio & Cross-Functional Collaboration

## The Product Trio Concept

A product trio typically consists of:
- **Product Manager**
- **Designer** (Product Designer)
- **Software Engineer** (Tech Lead)

These are the **three roles minimally required to create good digital products**.

## Connection to Marty Cagan

The **product team concept** was first mentioned in Marty Cagan's book "INSPIRED."

The product trio gained traction with the rise of user-centric approaches and agile methodologies, promoted by leaders like Marty Cagan and Teresa Torres.

## Collaboration Over Handoffs

Marty Cagan of Silicon Valley Product Group describes teams as "**mercenary teams**" instead of "**missionary teams**" when designers and engineers work in a traditional handoff style.

Cagan emphasizes **defining products collaboratively, not sequentially**, stating:

> "You need all three roles working closely together."

## Risk Management Distribution

- **Product Manager**: Responsible for value risk and business viability risk
- **Product Designer**: Responsible for usability risk
- **Lead Engineer**: Responsible for feasibility risk

## Engineer Involvement in Discovery

Marty Cagan argues in "INSPIRED":

> "If you're just using your engineers to code, you're only getting about half their value."

Cagan emphasizes that **product managers, product designers, and engineers must work on product discovery as a team**, using their unique insights and experiences to come up with ideas and test them together.

## Analysis Notes

**Structural Model:**
- Minimal viable team = 3 roles
- Each role owns specific risks
- Collaboration > handoffs

**Key Principle:**
- Engineers as problem-solvers, not code monkeys
- "Half their value" if only coding
- Discovery requires all three roles

**Anti-Pattern:**
- Sequential handoffs (waterfall disguised)
- Engineers entering late
- Designer as "lipstick on pig"

**Communication Pattern:**
- Clear role boundaries with collaborative overlap
- Accountability distribution
- Mutual dependence for success
