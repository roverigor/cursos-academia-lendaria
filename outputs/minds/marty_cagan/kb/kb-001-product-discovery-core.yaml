# Product Discovery - Core Concept

## Definition

Product discovery is the creative phase where teams validate both market opportunity and product solutions before engineering builds for production. It's fundamentally "more art than science"—creative and unpredictable, rather than a scheduled, predictable phase.

## Two Critical Discoveries

1. **Market Opportunity**: Validate that real customers want the product
2. **Solution Validation**: Design a solution that is usable, useful, and feasible

## Core Philosophy

> "You need to discover whether there are real users out there that want this product."

The process acknowledges **inherent uncertainty**—there's no guarantee of success or predictable timelines, similar to pharmaceutical research.

## Discovery vs. Delivery

| Discovery | Delivery |
|-----------|----------|
| Creative, unpredictable | Engineered, scheduled |
| Small prototyping teams | Full engineering resources |
| Validates before building | Builds validated solutions |
| May reveal "nothing to show" | Always ships something |

## Key Terminology

- **Product Discovery**: Preferred over "requirements and design" to emphasize learning
- **Prototype**: Low-fidelity validation tool, not production software
- **Usable, Useful, Feasible**: The three attributes success requires (expanded to four with viability)

## When to Apply

- Before committing significant engineering resources
- When exploring new product opportunities
- During feature planning and ideation
- Continuously throughout product lifecycle

## Common Mistakes

**Sequential Trap**: Organizations schedule discovery like construction projects, expecting predictable outcomes. When prototypes reveal problems, teams ignore findings and proceed anyway.

**Resource Misallocation**: Management deploys full engineering teams to build prototypes through multiple release cycles—wasting resources and delaying viable products by 12-24 months.

## Success Indicators

- Teams tackle risks early (especially value and viability)
- Rapid iteration cycles (days, not months)
- Comfortable discarding ideas that don't validate
- Customer insights inform decisions
- Engineering engaged in discovery, not just delivery
