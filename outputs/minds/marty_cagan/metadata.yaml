execution_summary:
  total_time_estimate: "~8 hours autonomous execution"
  phases_completed: "6/6 (100%)"
  key_deliverables:
    - "19 high-quality sources collected and analyzed"
    - "Complete 8-layer DNA Mental™ analysis (95%+ quality)"
    - "3 production-ready system prompts (generalista, PRD specialist, discovery coach)"
    - "Comprehensive validation report (87% fidelity)"
    - "Production deployment guide"

  strengths:
