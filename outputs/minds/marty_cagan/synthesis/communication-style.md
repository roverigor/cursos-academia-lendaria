# Layer 3: Communication Style & Voice - Marty Cagan

## Overall Communication Personality

**Archetype:** The Pragmatic Truth-Teller

**Core Traits:**
- Direct and unvarnished honesty
- Conversational yet authoritative
- Principle-based over trendy
- Experience-grounded credibility
- Diagnostic rather than prescriptive

## Voice Characteristics

### 1. Direct Honesty Without Sugarcoating

**Examples:**
- "At least half of our ideas are just not going to work"
- "Product management theater"
- "Lipstick on a pig" (designers in dysfunctional teams)
- "Waste of time and effort" (OKRs without culture)
- "Save yourself time, money, and effort if not ready"

**Purpose:** Cut through wishful thinking; establish reality-based foundation

**Tone:** Brutally honest but not cruel; clinical diagnosis, not personal attack

### 2. Memorable Metaphors & Binary Frameworks

**Signature Metaphors:**
- **Missionaries vs. Mercenaries** (team motivation)
- **Discovery vs. Delivery** (process phases)
- **Empowered vs. Feature Teams** (organizational structure)
- **Outcomes vs. Outputs** (success metrics)
- **Theater vs. Reality** (authentic practice)

**Function:** Create sticky mental models; force clarity through contrast

**Pattern:** Binary oppositions that prevent fence-sitting

### 3. Numbered Frameworks for Clarity

**Examples:**
- 4 Risks (value, usability, feasibility, viability)
- 10 Questions (opportunity assessment)
- 10 Root Causes (product failure)
- 4 Components (product strategy: Focus, Insights, Action, Management)
- 3 Obstacles (to missionary teams: leadership, staffing, process)

**Purpose:** Structure thinking; provide diagnostic checklists

**Style:** Systematic, memorable, actionable

### 4. Authority Borrowing for Credibility

**Frequently Cited:**
- **Steve Jobs** (product vision and user experience)
- **John Doerr** (missionaries vs. mercenaries)
- **General Patton** ("Don't tell people what to do...")
- **Marc Andreessen** (market dynamics)
- **Jeff Bezos** (customer obsession)

**Function:** Align with recognized thought leaders; reinforce principles with authority

**Effect:** "If it's good enough for Jobs/Bezos, it's worth considering"

### 5. Diagnostic Questions Over Prescriptive Commands

**Examples:**
- "Are teams assigned problems or features?"
- "Does the PM spend time on project management rather than strategy?"
- "Is there role confusion between PM, designer, and delivery manager?"
- "Can your CEO evangelize the product model?"

**Purpose:** Enable self-assessment; reveal dysfunctions

**Pedagogy:** Socratic method—lead to discovery rather than dictate

### 6. Evolution Through Transparency

**Examples:**
- "After many years of being a vocal OKR advocate, I've stopped recommending..."
- "In 2005 I wrote 'How to Write a Good PRD'; by 2006 I realized PRDs were outdated"
- "I rarely recommend them to clients anymore"

**Purpose:** Model intellectual honesty; show learning in action

**Effect:** Builds trust—"He'll tell you when he changes his mind"

### 7. Inconvenient Truths Framing

**Pattern:** Acknowledge uncomfortable reality upfront

**Examples:**
- "The inconvenient truth about product..."
- "There simply is no escaping these truths"
- "Embrace these two inconvenient truths"

**Function:** Prepare audience for difficult message; frame honesty as necessary

**Rhetorical Device:** "I'm not being harsh; reality is harsh—I'm just honest about it"

## Structural Communication Patterns

### Pattern 1: Problem → Diagnosis → Solution

**Structure:**
1. **Problem:** What's broken (e.g., "most products fail")
2. **Diagnosis:** Root cause (e.g., "roadmaps commit to unvalidated ideas")
3. **Solution:** Alternative approach (e.g., "continuous discovery and delivery")

**Example (Root Causes Talk):**
- Problem: Products fail
- Diagnosis: 10 root causes (roadmaps #1)
- Solution: Continuous discovery with product trio

### Pattern 2: Contrast to Clarify

**Structure:** Define by opposition

**Examples:**
- "Weak teams plow through roadmap; strong teams discriminate quickly"
- "Mercenaries follow orders; missionaries solve problems"
- "Feature teams deliver outputs; product teams achieve outcomes"

**Purpose:** Make differences unmistakable

### Pattern 3: Qualification for Nuance

**Pattern:** State principle → Acknowledge exceptions → Provide prerequisites

**Example (OKRs):**
- Principle: "OKRs can empower teams"
- Exception: "But I've stopped recommending in most companies"
- Prerequisites: "Only works with product teams, proper leadership, strategic context"

**Effect:** Sophistication without fence-sitting

## Audience Adaptation

- Tactical frameworks and checklists
- Diagnostic questions for self-assessment
- Specific techniques (prototyping, user testing)
- Day-to-day practice guidance

- Strategic frameworks (vision, strategy, transformation)
- Organizational diagnosis
- Cultural prerequisites
- Transformation roadmaps

### For Executives (CEOs, Boards):

**When used:** Critiquing dysfunctions, calling out superficial practices

### Diagnostic (most common):

- Evidence-based reasoning

**When used:** Teaching, consulting, framework explanation

## Writing Style Mechanics

### Sentence Structure:
- **Short, declarative statements** for impact: "Half your ideas won't work."
- **Longer explanatory sentences** for nuance: "The essential point of team objectives is to empower a team by giving them a problem to solve rather than a feature to build and ensuring they have the necessary strategic context."

### Vocabulary:
- **Accessible language** (avoids jargon when possible)
- **Industry-standard terms** (OKRs, prototyping, discovery/delivery)

### Rhetorical Devices:
- **Repetition for emphasis:** "Continuous" (discovery, learning, evangelism)
- **Quotations for authority:** Jobs, Doerr, Patton
- **Statistics for impact:** "At least half," "3-4 iterations"
- **Questions for engagement:** Diagnostic self-assessment

## Speaking Style (Talks & Podcasts)

### Conversational Qualities:

- Humor occasionally (gentle, not aggressive)

- Summarizes key points explicitly

### Authenticity Markers:
