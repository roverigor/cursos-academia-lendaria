# Layer 4: Frameworks & Methodologies - Marty Cagan

## Core Frameworks Overview

Marty Cagan has developed numerous frameworks over his 40+ year career. These frameworks are designed to be **lightweight, actionable, and principle-based** rather than rigid processes.

---

## 1. The Four Risks Framework

**Purpose:** Systematic risk identification and mitigation in product development

**The Four Risks:**

1. **Value Risk** - Will customers buy it or choose to use it?
2. **Usability Risk** - Can users figure out how to use it?
3. **Feasibility Risk** - Can we build it with our time, skills, and technology?
4. **Business Viability Risk** - Does it work for all aspects of our business?

**Risk Ownership:**
- **Product Manager:** Value + Viability risks
- **Product Designer:** Usability risk
- **Lead Engineer:** Feasibility risk

**When to Apply:** During product discovery, before committing to delivery

**Key Principle:** "Tackle the big risks early—especially value risk and business risk"

**Evolution Note:** Expanded from original 3 risks (valuable, usable, feasible) to 4 by adding viability

---

## 2. Opportunity Assessment Framework

**Purpose:** Lightweight evaluation of product opportunities before investment

**The 10 Core Questions:**

1. **Problem Definition** - "Exactly what problem will this solve (value proposition)?"
   - *Note:* "Most challenging element" - teams often list features instead of crisp problem statement

2. **Target Market** - "For whom do we solve that problem?"

3. **Market Size** - "How big is the opportunity?"

4. **Competition** - "What alternatives are out there (competitive landscape)?"

5. **Differentiation** - "Why are we best suited to pursue this?"

6. **Timing** - "Why now (market window)?"

7. **Go-to-Market** - "How will we get this product to market?"
   - *Note:* "Can have significant impact on product requirements"

8. **Success Metrics** - "How will we measure success/make money?"

9. **Critical Requirements** - "What factors are critical to success?"

10. **Recommendation** - "Given the above, what's the recommendation (go or no-go)?"

**Output Format:** Lightweight assessment for senior management decision-making

**Philosophy:** Replace heavy Market Requirements Documents with quick, effective evaluation

**When to Use:** Before major product investments; even when executives have already decided (to provide clarity)

---

## 3. Product Discovery Process

**Purpose:** Validate ideas before building them

**Core Principle:** "More art than science" - embraces uncertainty rather than denies it

**Process Steps:**

1. **Opportunity Assessment** - Understand the problem
2. **User Research** - Interview real users about their needs
3. **Prototyping** - Build interactive mockups (not production code)
4. **User Testing** - Validate prototype assumptions with customers
5. **Iterate** - Adjust based on learnings before engineering begins

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Creative, unpredictable** (vs. engineered, scheduled)
- **Small prototyping teams** (vs. full engineering)
- **Validates before building** (vs. builds then validates)
- **May reveal "nothing to show"** (vs. always ships something)

**Techniques by Phase:**

**Framing Phase:**
- Problem definition
- Opportunity assessment
- Strategic context

**Planning Phase:**
- Research planning
- Hypothesis formation
- Success criteria

**Ideation Phase:**
- Customer interviews
- Data analytics
- Competitive research
- Product trio brainstorming

**Prototyping Phase:**
- High-fidelity prototypes
- Interactive mockups
- Rapid iteration

**Testing Phase:**
- Usability testing
- Customer validation
- Feasibility assessment
- Business viability check

## 4. Product Strategy Framework

**Purpose:** Bridge vision to execution

**Definition:** "How do we make the product vision a reality, while meeting the needs of the company as we go?"

**Four Essential Components:**

1. **Focus** - Making tough choices about what truly matters
   - Concentrating resources on critical few objectives
   - Focus as **subtraction**, not addition

2. **Insights** - Generating understanding through study, data, and customer learning
   - Market dynamics
   - Capabilities assessment
   - Competitive landscape
   - Customer needs

3. **Action** - Converting insights into concrete decisions
   - Which teams pursue which objectives
   - Equipped with strategic context

4. **Management** - Active, engaged leadership
   - Monitors progress
   - Removes obstacles
   - Facilitates collaboration
   - Adapts as circumstances change

**Hierarchy:**
- **Vision** = What you want to achieve (the goal)
- **Strategy** = How you'll accomplish it (the approach)
- **Tactics** = Specific details of execution (roadmap items)

**Within Product Teams:**
- **Strategy** determines which problems to solve
- **Discovery** determines how to solve them
- **Delivery** builds the solution

---

## 5. Empowered Teams Framework

**Purpose:** Organizational structure for high-performance product development

**Team Composition:** The Product Trio
- Product Manager
- Product Designer
- Tech Lead / Engineer

**Empowered vs. Feature Teams:**

| Empowered Teams | Feature Teams |
|----------------|---------------|
| Assigned **problems** to solve | Assigned **features** to build |
| Accountable for **outcomes** | Accountable for **outputs** |
| Decide **how** to solve | Execute **what** to build |
| Strategic context provided | Prioritized backlog provided |
| **Missionaries** | **Mercenaries** |

**Requirements for Empowerment:**

**From Leadership:**
- Compelling vision
- Clear strategy
- Principles and priorities
- Constant evangelism

**From Management:**
- Competent staffing (product, design, engineering)
- Weekly coaching
- Clear quarterly objectives (OKRs)

**From Team:**
- Deep engagement and motivation
- Strong business context understanding
- Genuine customer empathy
- Sense of accountability

**Three Obstacles to Avoid:**
1. **Leadership** - Executives wanting compliance over discussion
2. **Staffing** - Hiring mercenaries or using contractors
3. **Process** - Command-and-control frameworks

---

## 6. Missionaries vs. Mercenaries Framework

**Purpose:** Diagnostic for team motivation and engagement

**Source:** John Doerr's assertion adapted by Cagan

**Missionary Teams:**
- Deep engagement and motivation
- Strong understanding of business context
- Genuine empathy for customers
- Sense of empowerment and accountability
- Passion for solving problems
- Real connection with users

**Mercenary Teams:**
- Lack of empowerment or accountability
- Absence of passion for the problem
- Limited customer connection
- Tendency to simply follow directives

**Impact Statement:**
> "There's simply no comparison between the morale, speed and most importantly, the results, of a team of missionaries as compared with a team of mercenaries."

**Order of Impact:** Results > Morale > Speed

---

## 7. Product Operating Model

**Purpose:** Holistic system for tech-powered product companies

**Definition:** "Not a rigid process or single methodology. A conceptual model based on first principles."

**Five Core Pillars:**

1. **Product Teams** - Cross-functional, empowered teams
2. **Product Strategy** - How to accomplish vision
3. **Product Discovery** - Validating before building
4. **Product Delivery** - Building and shipping
5. **Product Culture** - Environment for success

**Critical Success Factor:** CEO as Chief Evangelist
> "The CEO needs to be viewed as the chief evangelist for the product model. If your CEO is unwilling or unable to do this, save yourself time, money, and effort by reassessing readiness."

**Transformation Types:**
- Legacy org → Product operating model
- Feature-driven org → Product operating model
- Sales-driven org → Product operating model

---

## 8. OKRs as Empowerment Framework (With Caveats)

**Purpose:** Empowerment technique through problem assignment, not feature lists

**Evolved Position:** "After many years of being a vocal OKR advocate, I've stopped recommending in most companies."

**How OKRs Should Work:**
- Management defines **what** outcomes are needed
- Management defines **how** success is measured
- Teams determine **how** to achieve objectives
- Shifts focus from **output to outcome**

**Three Prerequisites for Success:**

1. **Product Teams (not Feature Teams)**
   - If feature teams exist, OKRs will be "cultural mismatch" and "waste of time"

2. **Leadership-Driven Objectives**
   - Leadership provides objectives, not teams self-selecting
   - Objectives cascade from strategy, not bottom-up

3. **Strategic Context**
   - Vision + Strategy clearly communicated
   - Teams understand business context
   - Coaching support available

**When OKRs Fail:**
- Feature teams adopting OKRs
- Managers cascading their own objectives
- Missing leadership / vision
- "Contrived mashups of outcomes and features"

---

## 9. Product Vision & Evangelism Framework

**Purpose:** Inspire and align organization around product direction

**Vision Characteristics (EMPOWERED):**
- **Inspires** - Creates emotional connection
- **Compels** - Makes people want to contribute
- **Empowers** - Gives context for autonomy

**Evangelism Principle:**
> "There is no such thing as overcommunicating when it comes to explaining and selling the vision."

**Evangelism Requirements:**
- **Continuous** - Never "done"
- **Relentless** - Constant repetition required
- **Multi-audience** - Investors, board, leaders, customers, employees

**Ownership Paradox:**
- Head of Product **creates** vision
- CEO must **feel ownership** and evangelize
- Product leader as "strong, persuasive storyteller"

**Leadership vs. Management:**
- **Vision = Leadership** (inspires, sets direction)
- **Strategy = Management** (helps get there)

---

## 10. Root Causes of Product Failure Framework

**Purpose:** Diagnostic checklist for organizational dysfunction

**The 10 Root Causes:**

1. **Poor idea sourcing** - Stakeholders/customers aren't best sources
2. **Business case fallacy** - Revenue projections are guesses
3. **Roadmap problems** - #1 cause of failure
4. **Misaligned roles** - PM as requirements gatherer, designer too late
5. **False agility** - Only delivery is agile, not discovery
6. **Output over outcome focus** - Feature completion, not impact
7. **Late validation** - Customer feedback after development
8. **Opportunity cost** - Wasting engineering teams
9. **Product management theater** - Titles without skills
10. **Feature factory** - Building without validating

**Key Insight:** "At least half of the ideas on your roadmap aren't going to work"

**Solution:** Continuous discovery and delivery model

---

## 11. High-Fidelity Prototyping Framework

**Purpose:** Risk-free validation before engineering investment

**Definition:** Realistic, interactive representations of UX created before full development

**Key Benefits:**
- User validation before significant investment
- Identifies which ideas succeed
- Tests usability intuitively
- Enables collaboration (PM, Designer, Engineer)
- Provides organizational alignment
- Supplies detailed references for development

**Practical Guidance:**
- **Tools:** Axure, Balsamiq, Protoshare
- **Skills:** Comfort discarding work to explore
- **Version Control:** Formal management once dev begins
- **Agile Context:** Separate from sprint cycles

**Philosophy:** "Realistic enough to test, cheap enough to discard"

---

## 12. Customer Discovery Program Framework

**Purpose:** Deep customer learning through structured engagement

**Approach:** Work closely with a group of customers on important problem

**Guidance:** Identify at least **6 reference customers**

**Shared Learning Principle:**
> "Unless the actual product team—the PM, the product designer, and the engineers—learns the issues firsthand, they will not act on those learnings."

**Organizational Model:**
- **Small core** of professional user researchers
- Researchers **coach and enable** product teams
- Product teams **do discovery weekly**
- Research team enables, **not replaces**

**Research Types:**
- Qualitative techniques
- Quantitative techniques
- Mixed methods

---

## 13. The Inconvenient Truths Framework

**Purpose:** Reality check on product process expectations

**Truth #1:** "At least half of our ideas are just not going to work"

**Reasons:**
- Customers lack enthusiasm
- Implementations too complicated
- Development more complex than anticipated

**Truth #2:** "Good ideas need several iterations to deliver expected business value"

**Iteration Count:** Typically 3-4+ iterations required

**Team Comparison:**
- **Weak Teams:** "Plow through roadmap month after month"
- **Strong Teams:** "Quickly determine good ideas from bad" and iterate rapidly

**Response:** "Embrace these two inconvenient truths" and master rapid validation (days, not months)

## Framework Application Principles

### 1. Context-Dependent Usage
- Frameworks are guides, not rigid rules
- Prerequisites must be in place (culture, teams, leadership)
- "It depends" is valid answer with proper reasoning

### 2. First Principles Over Process
- Understand WHY framework exists
- Adapt to context while maintaining principles
- Avoid "framework theater" (surface adoption)

### 3. Systematic Thinking
- Frameworks interconnect (e.g., Four Risks → Discovery Process → Prototyping)
- Organizational prerequisites required (Empowered Teams → OKRs)
- Cultural foundation enables framework success

### 4. Evolution Transparency
- Cagan updates frameworks based on evidence
- PRD framework → Prototype-focused (2006)
- OKR advocacy → Cautious recommendation (recent)
- Transparency about changes maintains trust

## Key Takeaway

Marty Cagan's frameworks share common DNA:
- **Lightweight** over bureaucratic
- **Principle-based** over rigid processes
- **Outcome-focused** over output-driven
- **Reality-acknowledging** over wishful thinking
- **Collaborative** over sequential handoffs
- **Early risk mitigation** over late validation

These frameworks form an **integrated system**, not a menu of isolated tools. Cultural prerequisites (empowered teams, leadership commitment, missionary mindset) determine framework effectiveness.
