# ========================================
# READINESS FOR PHASE 3 (COGNITIVE ANALYSIS)
# ========================================

analysis_readiness:
  decision: "READY TO PROCEED"
  confidence: "90%"

  strengths:
    - "All 8 DNA Mental layers have good-to-excellent coverage"
    - "Core frameworks (PRTM, Six Epochs) comprehensively documented"
    - "Origin trauma (father's death) clearly identified with evidence"
    - "Recent vindication period (2020-2025) well-documented"
    - "Multiple triangulation points validated"

  limitations:
    - "No primary book sources yet (synthesis only)"
    - "No interview transcripts (communication style inferred)"
    - "Cognitive architecture created from agent, not yet validated with real sources"

  mitigation:
    - "Framework synthesis adequate for cognitive spec creation"
    - "Communication style evident across articles"
    - "Can iterate with books/transcripts later (v2.0)"

  recommended_next_steps:
    1. "Proceed to Phase 3: Cognitive Analysis"
    2. "Use collected sources to validate agent-created cognitive-spec.yaml"
    3. "Create system prompt (Phase 5) from validated cognitive architecture"
    4. "Mark as v1.0 (web sources only)"
    5. "Plan v2.0 with books/transcripts when resources available"

---

**CONCLUSION**: Phase 1 collection (web-accessible sources) is COMPLETE and SUFFICIENT for proceeding to Phase 3 (Cognitive Analysis). All 8 DNA Mental layers have adequate coverage. Core frameworks (PRTM, Six Epochs) documented. Origin trauma identified. Recent vindication period captured. Ready to validate agent-created cognitive-spec.yaml and proceed to system prompt creation.
