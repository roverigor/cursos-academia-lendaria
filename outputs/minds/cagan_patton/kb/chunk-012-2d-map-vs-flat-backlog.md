## The Flat Backlog Problem

### "Leaf Bag" Metaphor

"Pulling leaves off a tree and stuffing them in a bag" - you have all the pieces, but the structure and narrative are lost.

### What's Lost in Flat Backlogs:
- User journey flow
- Narrative coherence
- Relationship between stories
- Context for prioritization
- Shared understanding of "the whole"

### Result:
"There's nothing more useless than a big flat backlog"

## The 2D Map Solution

### Horizontal Axis (Left → Right)
- **Represents:** User journey sequence
- **Shows:** What users DO, in order
- **Enables:** Narrative flow visibility

### Vertical Axis (Top → Bottom)
- **Represents:** Priority within each activity
- **Shows:** Essential vs nice-to-have
- **Enables:** Release slicing

### Result:
2D structure reveals narrative complexity invisible in 1D lists

## Key Insight

This is not an "invented technique" but a **discovered pattern** - the insight that 2D spatial organization enables shared understanding in ways flat lists cannot.

## What 2D Maps Enable

1. **Narrative visibility:** See the user's story
2. **Context preservation:** Understand WHY each story matters
3. **Release slicing:** Draw horizontal lines for releases
4. **Shared understanding:** Visual thinking tool
5. **Walking skeleton identification:** End-to-end minimum visible

## Singularity

Jeff Patton's unique intellectual contribution: Recognizing that 2D spatial organization (activities horizontal, priority vertical) is THE pattern that reveals system narrative and enables shared understanding.
