# KB Chunk 011: Problems vs Features

**Source:** Cagan - Empowerment Core Principle
**Category:** Mental Model
**Tags:** #empowerment #problems #feature-factory

## Core Distinction

### Problems to Solve
- **What:** Customer pain points, business challenges
- **Ownership:** Team discovers HOW to solve
- **Outcome:** Multiple possible solutions
- **Result:** Empowerment, innovation, ownership

### Features to Build
- **What:** Prescribed solutions
- **Ownership:** Team executes WHAT was decided
- **Outcome:** One mandated approach
- **Result:** "Mercenaries," disempowerment, feature factory

## Empowerment Litmus Test

**Question:** What is the team assigned?
- **Problem:** "Help customers solve issues without contacting support" → EMPOWERED
- **Feature:** "Build a chatbot with these 15 features" → NOT EMPOWERED

## Why It Matters

### Problem Assignment Enables:
- Team discovers best solution
- Engineers contribute technology insights
- Designer explores UX alternatives
- Customer validation drives decisions
- Innovation and ownership

### Feature Prescription Creates:
- "Mercenaries" just executing orders
- No discovery, hope-driven development
- Talent attrition (smart people leave)
- Missed opportunities (better solutions ignored)
- Feature factory culture

## How to Reframe

❌ **Feature request:** "We need dark mode"
✅ **Problem reframe:** "Users with visual sensitivity struggle with bright interfaces"
→ Enables team to explore: Dark mode? Contrast adjustments? Theme options? User preference?

❌ **Feature roadmap:** Q1: Build X, Q2: Build Y, Q3: Build Z
✅ **Problem roadmap:** Q1: Solve customer issue A, Q2: Address business challenge B

## Leadership Shift Required

- **FROM:** "Here's what to build"
- **TO:** "Here's the problem to solve, here's why it matters, here are the outcome metrics"
