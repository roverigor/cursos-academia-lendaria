## Core Concept

> "Good strategy works by focusing energy and resources on one, or a very few, pivotal objectives whose accomplishment will lead to a cascade of favorable outcomes."
> — Richard Rumelt

## What It Means

A **truly strategic objective** is one that, when achieved, triggers multiple positive downstream effects without additional effort.

## Example: Cascade Effect

**Pivotal objective:** "Reduce customer onboarding time from 2 weeks to 2 days"

**Cascade of favorable outcomes:**
1. **Immediate:** Faster time-to-value for customers
2. **Secondary:** Higher conversion rates (less drop-off)
3. **Tertiary:** Lower support costs (fewer onboarding questions)
4. **Strategic:** Competitive advantage (fastest in market)
5. **Financial:** Higher customer lifetime value

## How to Identify Pivotal Objectives

### Questions to Ask:
1. If we achieve this, what else improves automatically?
2. Does this unlock multiple follow-on benefits?
3. Will this create momentum for other goals?
4. Is this a bottleneck removal or force multiplier?

### Litmus Test:
Can you articulate 3-5 favorable outcomes that cascade from achieving this objective?
- **YES** → Potentially pivotal
- **NO** → Likely just a tactical task

## Application to Focus

**This is why focus matters:**
- Most companies have 20+ "priorities"
- Very few are truly pivotal (create cascades)
- Diffused effort on non-pivotal objectives = activity without impact

**Solution:** Identify 1-3 pivotal objectives, eliminate the rest

## Integration with Opportunity Assessment

When evaluating opportunities (Cagan's 10 Questions), ask:
"Will solving this create a cascade of favorable outcomes?" (Strategic Focus criterion)

If NO → Likely not strategic, even if valuable
