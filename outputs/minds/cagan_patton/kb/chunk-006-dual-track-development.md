## Core Principle

One team runs discovery AND delivery simultaneously - NOT sequential phases, NOT separate teams.

## Two Tracks, Different Characteristics

### Discovery Track
- **Focus:** Fast learning and validation
- **Output:** Validated assumptions, killed ideas
- **Velocity:** Variable (experiments fail fast)
- **Quality:** Cheap prototypes (not production code)
- **Leadership:** Product Trio leads, team contributes

### Delivery Track
- **Focus:** Predictability and quality
- **Output:** Shippable product increments
- **Velocity:** Steady sprint rhythm
- **Quality:** Production-ready, scalable
- **Ownership:** Full team capacity

## How It Works

```
Sprint N:
  Discovery: Test 3 prototype variations with users
  Delivery: Ship stories from validated Sprint N-2 work

Discovery findings → Influence Sprint N+2 delivery
Delivery learnings → Inform Sprint N+1 discovery
```

## Key Insights

1. **Idea elimination is success:** "If we're doing discovery right, we kill lots of ideas"
2. **Not all discovery proceeds to delivery:** Failed experiments = valuable learning
3. **Continuous measurement:** Discovery doesn't stop at launch
4. **Whole-team participation:** Engineers contribute technology insights during discovery

## Capacity Allocation

- Early-stage product: 60% discovery, 40% delivery
- Growth-stage product: 40% discovery, 60% delivery
- Mature product: 20% discovery, 80% delivery

**RULE:** Never 0% discovery (continuous learning required)
