## Core Insight

> "Shared documents aren't shared understanding."
> — Jeff Patton

## The Problem

- People sign off on documents
- Believe they understand
- Actually have different interpretations
- Misalignment emerges during execution

## The Vacation Photos Metaphor

**Documents are like vacation photos:**
- Help YOU remember details
- Trigger YOUR memories of the experience
- Can't transfer the experience itself to someone else
- Without the trip (conversation), photos are meaningless

**Understanding emerges from the trip (conversation), not the photos (documents)**

## How Shared Understanding Actually Happens

### NOT Through:
- Reading documents alone
- Specification handoffs
- Sign-off meetings
- Email exchanges

### Through:
- **Conversation:** Dialogue and discussion
- **Collaborative artifact creation:** Building together
- **Visual thinking:** Shared drawing/mapping
- **Questions and debate:** Exploring different perspectives

## The Story Lifecycle (Card → Conversation → Confirmation)

1. **Card:** Write story on card (conversation prompt, not complete spec)
2. **Conversation:** Discuss what it means, how to test, edge cases, acceptance
3. **Confirmation:** Agree on acceptance criteria (what "done" looks like)

## Workshop Pattern

- **Facilitate, don't dictate:** Ask questions, don't prescribe
- **Build map collaboratively:** Not PM presenting
- **Ensure all voices heard:** Especially quiet engineers
- **Document as you go:** Visual radiator, living artifact

## Validation Check

"Can each team member draw/explain the user journey?"
- **NO** → Shared documents ≠ shared understanding (need workshop)
- **YES** → Shared understanding achieved
