## Definition

Product discovery is the work we do to determine whether ideas are worth building - answering: Will customers buy this? Can we build it? Does it work for our business?

## Core Principle

**Validate BEFORE building** (not build then hope)

## Key Characteristics

### 1. Fast and Cheap
- Rapid prototypes, not production code
- Days/weeks, not months
- Low investment to validate

### 2. Evidence-Based
- Customer validation required
- Data over opinions
- Test assumptions explicitly

### 3. Expects Change
- "If we're doing discovery right, we substantially change and kill lots of ideas"
- Idea elimination = success
- Pivot based on learning

### 4. Collaborative
- Product Trio leads
- Whole team contributes
- Engineers provide technology insights early

## Discovery Techniques

- Customer interviews
- Rapid prototypes (clickable, not functional)
- A/B tests
- Wizard of Oz (fake the backend)
- Usability testing
- Data analysis

## The Paradox

"Discovery creates unpredictability yet enables faster time-to-market"

**Resolution:** Small prototyping teams validate faster than expensive build-iterate cycles on production code.

## Integration with Delivery

- Run **dual-track:** Discovery AND delivery simultaneously
- Discovery on Sprint N → Informs Delivery on Sprint N+2
- NOT sequential phases (discover → build)
- Same team, two tracks

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Building without validation (hope-driven development)
- ❌ Sequential discovery then delivery phases
- ❌ Separate discovery and delivery teams
- ❌ Expensive prototypes (production-quality code for validation)
- ❌ Internal opinions instead of customer evidence

## Success Criteria

Did we:
- Validate customer value?
- Validate usability?
- Validate feasibility?
- Validate business viability?

If ALL yes → Proceed to delivery
If ANY no → Pivot or kill idea
