## The Metaphor

> "Documents are like vacation photos - they help you remember the trip, but they can't give someone else the experience."
> — Jeff Patton

## What It Means

### Vacation Photos:
- Help YOU remember details
- Trigger YOUR memories
- Remind you of experiences YOU had
- **Cannot transfer the experience to someone who wasn't there**

### Documents (Requirements, Stories, Specs):
- Help THE WRITER remember what was discussed
- Trigger THE WRITER'S understanding
- Remind THE WRITER of decisions made
- **Cannot transfer understanding to someone who wasn't in the conversation**

## The Core Insight

**Understanding comes from the trip (conversation), not the photos (documents)**

## Implications

### For Teams:
- Reading a spec ≠ Understanding the problem
- Reviewing a document ≠ Shared understanding
- Sign-off meeting ≠ Genuine alignment
- **Need the conversation to build understanding**

### For Documentation:
- Documents as **memory aids** (valuable!)
- NOT as **understanding transfer** (impossible!)
- Write documents AFTER conversation (capture decisions)
- Use documents to TRIGGER conversation (not replace it)

## Anti-Pattern

❌ PM writes 50-page requirements document → Team reads it → PM believes they understand

**What actually happened:**
- PM has understanding (from their research/thinking)
- Team has words (from reading document)
- **Gap in understanding emerges during execution**

## Better Pattern

✅ PM facilitates workshop → Team builds story map together → Document captures decisions

**What happens:**
- Team has understanding (from collaborative conversation)
- Document serves as memory aid (vacation photos)
- **Shared understanding from shared experience**

## When to Use This Metaphor

Use when:
- Someone suggests "just document it better"
- Teams rely on specs without conversation
- Misalignment emerges despite "clear documentation"
- Arguing for workshop/collaboration time

**Message:** "We need the trip (conversation), not just better photos (documents)"
