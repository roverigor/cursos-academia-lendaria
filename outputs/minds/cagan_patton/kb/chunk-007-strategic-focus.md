## Core Principle

> "Good strategy works by focusing energy and resources on one, or a very few, pivotal objectives whose accomplishment will lead to a cascade of favorable outcomes."
> — Richard Rumelt (cited by Cagan)

## The Focus Problem

**Most organizations:**
- Believe they're focused
- Maintain 20-30 "critical" priorities
- Reality: **10x too many**

**Causes:**
- Fear of missing opportunities
- Pressure from customers/stakeholders
- Reluctance to disappoint
- Need to explain lost deals

## The Real Constraint

**You can realistically focus on:** 1-3 pivotal objectives at org level

**More than that creates:**
- Context switching
- Management overhead
- Reduced throughput
- Activity without impact

## How to Focus

### 1. List All Potential Objectives
- Don't filter yet
- Get everything on the table

### 2. Apply Strategic Elimination
- Which 1-3 create "cascade of favorable outcomes"?
- What's the opportunity cost of each?
- Which can we defer without severe consequences?

### 3. Say "No" with Strategic Courage
- Explain why (strategic reasoning)
- Document for future reference
- Resist stakeholder pressure

### 4. Set WIP Limits at Org Level
- Not just team-level (Kanban boards)
- Limit number of concurrent initiatives
- Finish before starting new

## Paradox

"Leaders believe they focus while maintaining 10x too many priorities"

**Resolution:** Strategic courage to say no; concentration over distribution
