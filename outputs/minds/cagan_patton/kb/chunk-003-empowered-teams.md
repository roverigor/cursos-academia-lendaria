## Definition

Empowered teams are assigned meaningful PROBLEMS (not features), have autonomy to decide HOW to solve them, and are accountable for OUTCOMES (not output).

## The Empowerment Litmus Test

**True empowerment requires ALL three:**

1. Team assigned **meaningful problems** (not features to build)
2. Team decides **HOW to solve** (method autonomy)
3. Team accountable for **outcomes** (not output metrics)

**If leadership prescribes the solution → NOT empowered**

## Team Composition: The Product Trio

**Minimum viable team:**
- 1 Product Manager (business value decisions)
- 1 Designer (user experience decisions)
- 1-10 Engineers (technical feasibility decisions)

**Why these three:**
- Different judgment domains
- Complementary expertise
- Irreducible minimum for quality decisions

## Leadership Responsibilities

1. **Product Vision:** Where are we going?
2. **Product Strategy:** Which problems to solve?
3. **Team Topology:** How is work divided?
4. **Team Objectives:** What outcomes to achieve?
5. **Coaching:** How to improve?

## Anti-Patterns (Feature Factory)

- ❌ Feature roadmaps (prescribe solutions)
- ❌ Output metrics (stories completed, velocity)
- ❌ Separate discovery/delivery teams
- ❌ Stakeholder-driven priorities
- ❌ Teams as "mercenaries" (not "missionaries")

## Why It Matters

- Empowered teams deliver outcomes, not just output
- Ownership drives motivation and innovation
- Teams closer to customers make better decisions
- Talent retention improves (missionaries vs mercenaries)
