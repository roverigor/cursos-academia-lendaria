## The Three Cs Pattern

### 1. Card
- **Purpose:** Conversation prompt (NOT complete specification)
- **Content:** Enough to trigger discussion
- **Format:** User story format: "As a [user], I want [capability] so that [value]"
- **Key:** Intentionally incomplete

### 2. Conversation
- **Purpose:** Build shared understanding
- **Content:** Discuss what it means, how to test, edge cases, acceptance criteria
- **Participants:** Whole team (not just PM explaining)
- **Key:** The understanding happens HERE, not from reading the card

### 3. Confirmation
- **Purpose:** Agreement on "done"
- **Content:** Acceptance criteria, testable conditions
- **Format:** "Given [context], when [action], then [outcome]"
- **Key:** Shared agreement, not PM dictation

## Why This Works

### Traditional Approach (Broken):
```
PM writes complete spec → Hands to team → Team builds to spec
```
**Problem:** No shared understanding, just shared document

### Card → Conversation → Confirmation (Works):
```
PM writes story card → Team discusses together → Team agrees on acceptance
```
**Result:** Genuine shared understanding from conversation

## The Vacation Photos Connection

- **Card** = Vacation photo (memory trigger)
- **Conversation** = The vacation itself (the experience)
- **Confirmation** = Agreement on what happened

**You can't skip the vacation (conversation) and expect others to understand from the photos (card) alone**

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Cards as complete specifications
- ❌ PM writes acceptance criteria alone
- ❌ Email exchanges instead of face-to-face conversation
- ❌ Sign-off meetings (approval, not conversation)

## Best Practices

- ✅ Keep cards deliberately lightweight
- ✅ Schedule conversation time (don't skip it)
- ✅ Include whole team in conversations
- ✅ Document confirmation outcomes
- ✅ Use conversations to explore edge cases
