## Core Principle

Hire for **competence + character**, NOT "cultural fit"

## The Two Requirements

### 1. Competence
- **Technical/Domain Skills:** Can they do the job?
- **Judgment:** Do they make good decisions?
- **Learning Ability:** Can they grow with the role?
- **Track Record:** Have they delivered results?

### 2. Character
- **Integrity:** Do they do the right thing?
- **Work Ethic:** Are they committed?
- **Collaboration:** Can they work with others?
- **Ownership:** Do they take responsibility?

## Why NOT "Cultural Fit"

### Problems with "Cultural Fit":
- Homogeneous teams (everyone similar)
- Narrow diversity (hire people like us)
- Stagnation (no fresh perspectives)
- Bias amplification (perpetuates existing biases)

### Cagan's Stance:
"Cultural fit" often means "people we're comfortable with" - this limits diversity and innovation.

## The Balance

**Competence ALONE is insufficient:**
- Brilliant jerks destroy team dynamics
- High performers with low integrity create risk
- Talent without collaboration doesn't scale

**Character ALONE is insufficient:**
- Nice people who can't deliver don't help
- Good intentions without capability fail
- Team needs results, not just good vibes

**BOTH REQUIRED:**
Competent people with strong character who bring diverse perspectives

## Application to Empowered Teams

**Why this matters for empowerment:**
- Empowered teams need competent judgment (not just executors)
- Character enables outcome accountability (ownership)
- Diverse perspectives improve discovery (challenge assumptions)

## Interview Focus

**Competence Assessment:**
- Technical interviews
- Portfolio/work samples
- Reference checks on delivery
- Problem-solving exercises

**Character Assessment:**
- Behavioral interviews
- How they describe past conflicts
- References on collaboration
- Integrity check conversations
