## Overview

User Story Mapping is a 2D visual decomposition technique that reveals user journey narrative and enables shared understanding in ways flat 1D backlogs cannot.

## Structure

### Horizontal Axis: User Journey (Left → Right)
- Sequence of user activities
- Tells the story of what users DO
- Maintains narrative flow

### Vertical Axis: Priority (Top → Bottom)
- Most important at top
- Nice-to-have at bottom
- Enables release slicing

## The 5-Step Process

### Step 1: Identify User Activities (Backbone)
- High-level things users do
- Arrange left-to-right in journey sequence
- Example: [Find] → [Purchase] → [Receive] → [Use] → [Support]

### Step 2: Break Into User Tasks (Skeleton)
- Detailed steps under each activity
- Arrange vertically by priority

### Step 3: Add Implementation Details (Stories)
- User stories: "As a [user], I want [capability] so that [value]"
- Stack vertically under tasks

### Step 4: Identify Walking Skeleton
- Draw horizontal line through highest-priority items
- Must include something from EVERY activity
- End-to-end minimum functionality

### Step 5: Slice Releases
- Good: Walking skeleton (MVP)
- Better: Enhanced capabilities
- Best: Full-featured ideal state

## Why It Works

**Problem with flat backlogs:** "Like pulling leaves off a tree and stuffing them in a bag" - lose narrative structure and context

**Solution with 2D maps:** Visual spatial organization reveals:
- User journey flow
- Priority within activities
- Release slicing options
- Shared understanding

## Key Insight

"Shared documents aren't shared understanding" - the map-building conversation creates understanding, not just the artifact.
