## Definition

The Product Trio is the minimum irreducible unit for quality product decisions, consisting of three complementary roles with different judgment domains.

## The Three Roles

### 1. Product Manager
- **Domain:** Business value and viability
- **Key questions:** What problems should we solve? Will this work for the business?

### 2. Designer
- **Domain:** User experience and desirability
- **Key questions:** Is this usable? Do customers want this?

### 3. Senior Engineer (Tech Lead)
- **Domain:** Technical feasibility
- **Key questions:** Can we build this? What's the best technical approach?

## Why These Three

- **Complementary expertise:** Different knowledge domains
- **Irreducible minimum:** Can't make quality product decisions without all three
- **Shared ownership:** Collaborative decision-making

## How They Work Together

- **Discovery:** Product Trio leads, whole team contributes
- **Decisions:** Collaborative, each brings domain expertise
- **Accountability:** Shared outcomes ownership

## Anti-Pattern

❌ PM writes requirements, hands to Designer → hands to Engineers (sequential handoff)
✅ Trio collaborates from problem definition through solution discovery
