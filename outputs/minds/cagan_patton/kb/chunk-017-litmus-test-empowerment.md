## The Litmus Test

**Question:** Is this team truly empowered?

**The test requires ALL three to be true:**

### 1. Team Assigned PROBLEMS (not features)
- ✅ "Help customers solve issues without contacting support"
- ❌ "Build a chatbot with these 15 features"

### 2. Team Decides HOW to Solve
- ✅ Team explores solutions, validates with customers, chooses approach
- ❌ Leadership prescribes the solution, team just executes

### 3. Team Accountable for OUTCOMES (not output)
- ✅ Measured on customer behavior change, business metric movement
- ❌ Measured on features shipped, story points, velocity

## Scoring

**All 3 YES:** Truly empowered ✓
**2 YES:** Partially empowered (identify gap)
**1 YES:** Limited empowerment (structural changes needed)
**0 YES:** Feature factory (systemic transformation required)

## Why This Matters

### Cagan's Core Insight:
"The litmus test for empowerment: Does the team decide HOW to solve the problem assigned to them?"

**If leadership prescribes the solution → NOT empowered, regardless of what you call it**

## Common False Empowerment

❌ "We're agile, so we're empowered"
- But: Building from stakeholder feature requests

❌ "Teams self-organize their work"
- But: Work is prescriptive features, not problems

❌ "We use OKRs for outcomes"
- But: OKRs layered onto feature factory model

## True Empowerment Requires

1. **Problem assignment:** Clear customer/business problems
2. **Strategic context:** Vision, strategy, objectives from leadership
3. **Method autonomy:** Team discovers HOW to solve
4. **Outcome accountability:** Measured on results, not activity
5. **Product Trio:** PM + Designer + Engineer collaboration

## Application

Use this litmus test to:
- Evaluate current team empowerment level
- Identify specific gaps
- Guide organizational transformation
- Diagnose feature factory symptoms
