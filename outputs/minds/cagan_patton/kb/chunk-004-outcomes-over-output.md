## The Fundamental Distinction

| Output | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Features shipped | Customer problems solved |
| Story points completed | Business metrics moved |
| Releases delivered | User behavior changed |
| Velocity maintained | Revenue/engagement/retention improved |

## Why Outcomes Are Hard

### Problem 1: Vague Objectives
- ❌ "Provide integrated platform"
- ✅ "Help customers solve issues without contacting support"

### Problem 2: Wrong Metrics
- Using existing KPIs (gas gauge) instead of problem-specific measures
- "The tachometer is a KPI, but not measuring if you solved the problem"

### Problem 3: Missing Data Infrastructure
- Teams lack telemetry to measure outcomes
- Can't tell if solutions work

### Problem 4: No Product Strategy
- Without strategy, can't connect business goals to team problems

## Prerequisites for Outcomes

1. **Adopt product model first** (can't layer OKRs onto feature factory)
2. **Clear problem statements**
3. **Appropriate success metrics defined upfront**
4. **Instrumentation in place**
5. **Product strategy connecting goals to problems**

## Measurement Framework

For each problem:
- **Leading indicator:** Early signal (e.g., trial signups)
- **Lagging indicator:** Actual outcome (e.g., conversion to paid)
- **Counter-metric:** Prevent gaming (e.g., trial quality, not just quantity)

## Core Principle

**Outcomes are simple conceptually but hard in practice** - requires systemic product model adoption, not OKR overlay on feature factory.
