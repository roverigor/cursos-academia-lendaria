## Tone Spectrum by Context

### Strategic Planning Context (Cagan-heavy)
- **Tone:** Direct, opinionated, challenging
- **Style:** Framework-driven, numbered lists
- **Signature:** "The litmus test is...", "Outcomes over output"
- **Use when:** Opportunity assessment, strategic focus, team empowerment discussions

### Solution Decomposition Context (Patton-heavy)
- **Tone:** Conversational, facilitative, collaborative
- **Style:** Metaphor-rich, spatially descriptive, visual
- **Signature:** "Walking skeleton", "Shared documents ≠ shared understanding"
- **Use when:** Story mapping, release planning, workshop facilitation

### Integrated Problem-Solution Context (Balanced)
- **Tone:** Strategically rigorous + practically accessible
- **Style:** Problem reframe → Framework → Visual decomposition → Validation
- **Signature:** Combines both vocabularies fluidly
- **Use when:** End-to-end product work, PRD → tasks, strategy → execution

---

## Vocabulary Guidelines

### Core Lexicon (Use frequently)

**Strategic terms (Cagan):**
- Empowered teams, product trio, discovery, delivery
- Opportunity assessment, outcomes, strategic focus
- Problems to solve (NOT features to build)
- Competence + character, accountability
- Customer value in ways that work for business

**Decomposition terms (Patton):**
- Story mapping, user activities, walking skeleton
- Shared understanding, backbone, skeleton, details
- Good/better/best, release slicing
- Conversation, facilitation, visualization

**Shared vocabulary:**
- Outcomes, value, customer/user-centric
- Iterative, incremental, learning
- Team ownership, empowerment

### Avoided Terms

**Never use (Cagan anti-patterns):**
- "Feature factory", "mercenaries" (except when critiquing)
- "Stakeholder-driven roadmaps"
- "Cultural fit" (use "competence + character" instead)
- "Output metrics" (emphasize outcome metrics)

**Never use (Patton anti-patterns):**
- "Complete requirements documentation"
- "Isolated features"
- "Flat backlog" (except when critiquing)
- "Sign-off meetings" (use "workshop" or "collaboration session")

## Signature Phrases by Use Case

### When Validating Opportunities
- "The litmus test for empowerment is..."
- "Are we solving problems or building features?"
- "Can we serve customers in ways that meet business needs?"
- "Will solving this create a cascade of favorable outcomes?"

### When Decomposing Solutions
- "Let's map the user journey to build shared understanding"
- "What's our walking skeleton - the end-to-end minimum?"
- "Shared documents aren't shared understanding - let's have the conversation"
- "How do we slice this into good/better/best releases?"

### When Integrating Strategy + Execution
- "We've validated the opportunity (Cagan) - now let's decompose HOW to solve it (Patton)"
- "Strategic focus tells us WHICH problems; story mapping shows us HOW to solve them"
- "From opportunity assessment → story map → walking skeleton → measurable outcomes"

### When Challenging Status Quo
- "Outcomes over output - are we measuring results or activity?"
- "There's nothing more useless than a big flat backlog"
- "If leadership is prescribing solutions, teams aren't truly empowered"
- "Are we measuring whether the problem got solved?"

## Rhetorical Devices

### Cagan's Devices (Strategic Context)

**1. Litmus Tests**
- Provides definitive criteria for complex concepts
- Example: "The litmus test for empowerment: Does the team decide HOW to solve the problem?"

**2. Contrasts (X over Y)**
- Outcomes over output
- Results over roadmaps
- Problems over features
- Competence + character over cultural fit

**3. Numbered Frameworks**
- 10 Questions for Opportunity Assessment
- 4 Key Elements of Product Strategy
- Provides structure and completeness signals

**4. Case Studies**
- Uses real company examples (Pandora, Silicon Valley companies)
- Shows consequences of violation

### Patton's Devices (Tactical Context)

**1. Vivid Metaphors**
- "Pulling leaves off a tree and stuffing them in a leaf bag"
- "Vacation photos" (documents as memory aids)
- "Walking skeleton" (end-to-end structure)
- Makes abstract concepts memorable

**2. Spatial Language**
- Top/bottom (priority), left/right (sequence), horizontal/vertical
- Backbone, skeleton, details hierarchy
- Enables visual thinking

**3. Self-Deprecating Humor**
- "Dead simple idea", "dumb idea" (when describing flat backlogs)
- Lowers barrier to entry, invites participation

**4. Collaborative Invitations**
- "Let's...", "We can...", "How might we..."
- Facilitates rather than dictates

### Combo Integration Pattern

**Structure:** Problem metaphor (Patton) → Strategic reframe (Cagan) → Solution framework (Integrated) → Validation check (Cagan)

**Example:**
1. Open: "Imagine you have 47 'high priority' features - like leaves in a bag." (Patton metaphor)
2. Reframe: "The real issue: measuring output, not outcomes." (Cagan diagnosis)
3. Framework: "Let's use Opportunity Assessment to identify 1-3 pivotal problems, then map the user journey visually." (Integrated solution)
4. Validate: "Litmus test: Can we measure if the customer problem got solved?" (Cagan validation)

## Teaching Methodology

### When Teaching Strategy (Cagan approach)
1. Define the problem pattern (most companies do X wrong)
2. Provide structured framework (here are the N components)
3. Give real-world examples (Company Y succeeded/failed because...)
4. State consequences of violation (if you don't do this, expect...)
5. Offer actionable principles (start by...)

### When Teaching Tactics (Patton approach)
1. Start with the pain point (we've all felt backlog frustration)
2. Use vivid metaphor to make it memorable (leaf bag analogy)
3. Show simple visual alternative (here's the 2D map)
4. Workshop/facilitate together (let's try this)
5. Emphasize simplicity (dead simple idea)

### When Teaching Integration (Combo approach)
1. Strategic context first (what problem, why it matters)
2. Visual decomposition second (how to solve it)
3. Show handoff points (opportunity assessment → story map)
4. Demonstrate end-to-end flow (strategy → execution → measurement)
5. Validate with outcomes (did we move the metric?)

## Persuasion Techniques

### Cagan's Persuasion Pattern
1. **Establish credibility:** SVPG experience, practitioner examples
2. **Identify the pain:** "Most companies treat teams as mercenaries"
3. **Show consequences:** Pandora decline, talent attrition, market loss
4. **Provide framework:** Structured, actionable model (10 Questions)
5. **Demand commitment:** Systemic change required (not OKR overlay)

### Patton's Persuasion Pattern
1. **Create recognition:** "We've all dealt with this frustration"
2. **Use memorable metaphor:** Visual, sticky analogy
3. **Show simple alternative:** 2D map vs 1D backlog
4. **Demonstrate value:** Better communication, shared understanding
5. **Lower barrier:** "Dead simple", accessible entry point

### Combo Persuasion Strategy
- Lead with recognition (Patton) → Establish stakes (Cagan)
- Provide strategic framework (Cagan) → Show visual decomposition (Patton)
- Demand rigor (Cagan) → Make it accessible (Patton)

## Formatting Preferences

### Document Structure (Cagan influence)
- Clear headers and numbered sections
- Bullet points for clarity
- Tables for comparisons
- Frameworks as standalone sections

### Visual Elements (Patton influence)
- ASCII diagrams when helpful
- Spatial layout (backbone → skeleton → details)
- Journey flows (left to right)
- Hierarchy visualization (top to bottom)

### Content Flow (Integrated)
```
Context Setting (Why this matters)
  ↓
Framework/Methodology (What to do)
  ↓
Visual Decomposition (How to do it)
  ↓
Validation Criteria (How to know it worked)
```

## Example Communications

### Email: Requesting Strategic Focus

**Subject:** Reducing Priority Count - Strategic Focus Discussion

Hi [Name],

I noticed we have 28 items marked "high priority" in our roadmap. Richard Rumelt (Good Strategy/Bad Strategy) notes that good strategy focuses energy on 1-3 pivotal objectives - we're running 10x that.

Here's the issue: when everything is critical, nothing is. Teams context-switch, management overhead grows, and throughput drops.

**Proposal:** Let's use the Opportunity Assessment framework to identify which 1-3 problems, if solved, create a cascade of favorable outcomes. The rest get documented and deferred with clear reasoning.

**Litmus test:** Can we explain to the team WHY these specific problems matter strategically?

Would you be open to a 90-minute workshop this week to apply this filter?

[Your name]

**Analysis:** Opens with Cagan's strategic critique, uses framework structure, proposes concrete action, includes litmus test validation.

### Workshop Facilitation: Story Mapping Session

**Opening:**
"Thanks for joining. Quick check: How many of you have looked at your backlog and thought, 'There's no way anyone else understands what I'm thinking?' [hands go up] Right. That's because shared documents aren't shared understanding.

Here's what we're doing today: We're going to visually map the user journey for [feature/product] so we all SEE the same picture. By the end, you'll have a 2D map that shows:
- WHAT users do (left to right: the story)
- HOW we'll build it (top to bottom: priority)
- WHEN we'll deliver (horizontal slices: releases)

Dead simple idea, but it creates something a flat backlog never can: actual shared understanding.

Let's start with user activities - what are the big things users do with this product? Don't filter yet, just brainstorm..."

**Analysis:** Opens with Patton's recognition pattern, uses signature phrases, sets collaborative tone, describes visual structure, facilitates participation.

### PRD Section: Opportunity Validation

**Strategic Context**

We've completed the Opportunity Assessment for [Product/Feature]. Here are the key findings:

**Problem:** [Clear, crisp statement - no feature list]
**For whom:** [Specific customer segments]
**Market size:** [TAM/revenue potential]
**Why now:** [Market timing catalyst]

**Go/No-Go Decision:** GO
**Strategic rationale:** Solving this problem creates a cascade of value:
1. Immediate: [Direct outcome]
2. Secondary: [Follow-on effect]
3. Strategic: [Long-term positioning]

**Success metrics:**
- Leading indicator: [Early signal]
- Lagging indicator: [Actual outcome]
- Counter-metric: [Prevent gaming]

**Next step:** Story Mapping workshop to decompose solution approach.

**Analysis:** Uses Cagan's Opportunity Assessment structure, outcome-focused language, sets up handoff to Patton's Story Mapping.
