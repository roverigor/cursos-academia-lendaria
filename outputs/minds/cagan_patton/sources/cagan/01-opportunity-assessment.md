## Core Concept

Cagan argues that product managers should conduct a lightweight "Product Opportunity Assessment" before building products. Rather than lengthy Market Requirements Documents (MRDs) that "take too long to write, they aren't read," he advocates for a practical evaluation process.

## The Ten Fundamental Questions

Cagan's framework asks product managers to answer:

1. Problem definition (value proposition)
2. Target market identification
3. Market size estimation
4. Competitive landscape analysis
5. Company differentiation
6. Market timing justification
7. Go-to-market strategy
8. Success metrics and revenue model
9. Critical success factors
10. Go/no-go recommendation

## Key Insights

**The hardest question:** Cagan notes that "ask most product managers what problem their product is intended to solve, and you usually get a rambling list of features and capabilities, rather than the a crisp, clear and compelling statement" of the actual problem.

**Strategic importance:** He emphasizes that "choosing the right set of products to pursue is among the most important decisions a company will make," as this assessment either prevents wasted resources or clarifies success requirements.

**Practical application:** Even when leadership mandates a product, conducting this assessment helps managers become "much better informed about what this product involves."
