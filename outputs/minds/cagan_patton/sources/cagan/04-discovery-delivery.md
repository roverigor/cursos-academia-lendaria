## The Core Concept

According to Marty Cagan, **product teams must remain unified** rather than splitting into separate discovery and delivery groups. He emphasizes: "each of your cross-functional product teams understands that they are responsible for both discovery and delivery work."

## How They Work Together

The two functions operate **continuously and simultaneously** within a single team:

- **Discovery** involves identifying customer problems, validating assumptions, and defining effective solutions
- **Delivery** entails designing and engineering those solutions into actual products

While team members may emphasize different activities at any given moment—product managers and designers focusing heavily on discovery, engineers on delivery—**everyone participates in both spheres**.

## The Anti-Pattern to Avoid

Cagan identifies a "very damaging" problem: separating discovery and delivery into distinct teams. This creates several harmful outcomes:

- **Loss of ownership** — those implementing solutions feel like "mercenaries" rather than stakeholders
- **Reduced innovation** — teams receiving handed-off requirements lack motivation to suggest improvements
- **Motivation decline** — the receiving group becomes disconnected from the problem-solving process

## Why Integration Matters

Keeping discovery and delivery unified is essential for:
- **Empowerment** — team members feel genuine ownership
- **Innovation** — all perspectives contribute to better solutions
- **Retention** — talented people self-select away from mercenary-style work environments

## DNA Mental™ Layer Markers

**Layer 1 - Mental Model:** Discovery + Delivery as unified continuous process
**Layer 2 - Thought Pattern:** Integration over handoffs
**Layer 4 - Decision Architecture:** All team members participate in both spheres
**Layer 5 - Values:** Ownership > Specialization; Innovation > Efficiency
**Layer 8 - Paradox:** Different emphases (PM/Design heavy discovery, Eng heavy delivery) within unified participation
