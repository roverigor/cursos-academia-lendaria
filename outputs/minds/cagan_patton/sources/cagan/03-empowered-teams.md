## Core Definition

Empowered product teams operate under a fundamentally different purpose than traditional technology teams. Rather than existing "to serve the business," these teams exist "to serve the customers, in ways that meet the needs of the business." This distinction profoundly impacts motivation, morale, and innovation capacity.

## Key Characteristics

### Purpose-Driven Composition

Teams comprise ordinary people with competence and character—not necessarily exceptional talent. The critical distinction lies in how organizations leverage their workforce to unlock extraordinary results rather than relying on hiring "10X" employees.

### Problem-Based Assignments

Instead of receiving feature lists, empowered teams tackle meaningful problems. As Cagan explains, "The litmus test for empowerment is that the team is able to decide the best way to solve the problems they have been assigned."

### Outcome Accountability

Teams are measured on business outcomes rather than feature output, giving them autonomy in determining solutions.

## Operational Structure

### Leadership Responsibilities

Establishing product vision, strategy, principles, priorities, and evangelism across the organization.

### Management Duties

Focus on three areas:
1. **Staffing** - hiring competent, non-toxic team members
2. **Coaching** - weekly development support
3. **Objective setting** - defining clear quarterly objectives rather than prescriptive tasks

## The Trust Foundation

Success requires people who demonstrate both competence in their craft and strong character—filtering for what matters rather than "cultural fit," which often inadvertently narrows diversity and perspective-taking capacity essential for problem-solving.

## DNA Mental™ Layer Markers

**Layer 1 - Mental Model:** Teams as problem-solvers, not feature-builders
**Layer 3 - Language:** "Serve customers in ways that meet business needs" (not "serve the business")
**Layer 5 - Values:** Competence + Character > Cultural fit; Ordinary people + Right structure > 10X hires
**Layer 7 - Singularity:** Problem assignment with outcome accountability as empowerment litmus test
**Layer 8 - Paradox:** Autonomy through constraint (teams empowered to solve, not decide which problems)
