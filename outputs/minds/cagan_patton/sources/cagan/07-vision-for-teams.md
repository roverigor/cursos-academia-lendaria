## Core Thesis

Cagan projects that within 3-10 years, generative AI will fundamentally reshape product team structures. Rather than eliminating roles, the technology will redistribute responsibilities toward higher-judgment work.

## Organizational Structure Transformation

**Current State:** Teams average 8 people (6 engineers, 1 product manager, 1 designer)

**Projected Future:** Teams shrink to 3 people—a product manager, designer, and engineer—focused primarily on discovery rather than delivery.

Cagan notes that "delivery will continue to improve, in many cases to the point where" well-defined solutions deploy nearly instantaneously. This shift redirects human effort toward product discovery—understanding problems and validating solutions rather than executing them.

## The "Discovery Trio"

Three distinct competencies remain essential because judgment requirements differ substantially:

- **Product managers** navigate business constraints
- **Designers** optimize user experience
- **Engineers** solve technological challenges

Cagan emphasizes this isn't about tool capability but about "what you choose to do with that tool." Historical precedent with no-code platforms suggests that automation alone doesn't replace specialized expertise.

## Team Autonomy and Scope

A major consequence involves expanding team responsibility scope through "assisted cognitive load"—tools that help teams manage larger problem spaces. Currently, multiple teams coordinate constantly; future teams will operate more independently.

## Economic and Workforce Implications

A medium-sized company with 15-20 product teams (120-160 people) could reduce to 3-5 teams (9-15 people), creating dramatic cost savings but also workforce disruption. Cagan acknowledges this reality while suggesting lower startup costs might fuel innovation explosions offsetting some displacement.

## DNA Mental™ Layer Markers

**Layer 1 - Mental Model:** Discovery Trio as irreducible unit (judgment > execution)
**Layer 2 - Thought Pattern:** Technology shifts work distribution, not elimination
**Layer 4 - Decision Architecture:** Judgment-based roles persist, execution automates
**Layer 5 - Values:** Discovery > Delivery (in future state); Human judgment > Tool capability
**Layer 7 - Singularity:** Product Trio concept remains constant despite technological change
**Layer 8 - Paradox:** Automation expands autonomy (teams manage more with less coordination)
