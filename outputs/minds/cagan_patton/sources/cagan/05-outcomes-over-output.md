## The Core Challenge

Moving from outputs (what we build) to outcomes (the difference we make) seems conceptually straightforward but proves difficult in practice. As Cagan notes, "many companies, the move to outcomes goes nowhere fast."

## The Biggest Mistake

The most critical error organizations make is attempting to adopt outcomes without first establishing the product model. Companies often try layering OKR techniques onto existing output-based processes, expecting transformation. However, "the OKR technique originated from, and is predicated upon, the product model."

Cagan emphasizes that outcomes are "the consequence of" adopting the product model—not something that can exist independently.

## Common Implementation Problems

**Vague Problems**: Teams working with unclear objectives struggle to measure success. Clear problem statements matter: "Help customers solve issues without contacting us" versus vague goals like "provide integrated platforms."

**Wrong Metrics**: Organizations mistakenly use existing KPIs rather than defining appropriate measures first. Cagan illustrates this with a car analogy—"the gas gauge and tachometer...are KPI's, but...not really measuring if you are solving the problem."

**Missing Data Infrastructure**: Teams often lack proper telemetry and instrumentation needed to measure whether solutions actually solve problems.

**Absent Strategy**: Without intentional product strategy, teams cannot connect business goals to specific problems worth solving.

## Focus on Value: The Central Problem

Marty Cagan identifies a widespread issue: many product teams concentrate their discovery efforts on usability or engineering concerns—addressing user confusion, performance bugs, or reliability issues—while overlooking the fundamental question of whether users perceive value in the product itself.

He articulates this bluntly: "the user doesn't see why they should use the app in the first place. They don't see the _value_."

### The Real Contribution

Cagan argues that truly strong engineers and designers contribute far beyond execution. Rather than limiting them to coding or visual design, exceptional teams leverage their talents for value discovery. Engineers apply emerging technologies creatively, designers understand user pain points, and product managers drive the entire value-creation process.

### Outcomes vs. Output

The philosophy emphasizes that "Good teams know they're responsible for _results_ or outcome, not output."

Without demonstrated value to customers, teams waste months perfecting features nobody wants. Conversely, when genuine value exists, users become motivated to overcome usability friction, making design and performance refinements genuinely impactful.

## The Challenge

Product teams typically work from roadmaps that *presume* value already exists. Cagan's core message is that discovering what would make products genuinely valuable—so users willingly choose to use them—is the actual job of product management.

## DNA Mental™ Layer Markers

**Layer 1 - Mental Model:** Outcomes as consequence of system, not technique
**Layer 2 - Thought Pattern:** Value first, refinement second
**Layer 4 - Decision Architecture:** Measure what matters, not what exists
**Layer 5 - Values:** Customer value > Features; Outcomes > Output; Results > Roadmaps
**Layer 6 - Obsession:** Value discovery as PM's actual job
**Layer 8 - Paradox:** Outcomes are simple conceptually but hard in practice (requires systemic change, not add-ons)
