## Core Principle

Effective product strategy requires organizations to concentrate resources on a small number of critical priorities rather than spreading efforts across many initiatives. Most companies significantly overestimate their focus capability.

## The Problem with Unfocused Organizations

Cagan identifies a common issue: leaders believe they practice good focus, yet maintain 20-30 "critically important" objectives simultaneously—roughly ten times more than actually feasible. This stems from:

- Fear of missing competitive opportunities
- Pressure to respond to every customer request
- Reluctance to disappoint stakeholders
- Need to address lost deals

### Case Study: Pandora

Pandora's prioritization process exemplified the dangers of stakeholder-driven roadmaps that distribute engineering capacity across business demands rather than focusing on customer impact. The company declined from a $16 IPO price to eventual acquisition.

## Key Consequences of Poor Focus

### Activity vs. Results

As Stephen Bungay notes, organizations can easily generate activity but struggle with "the *right things* – things that *matter*, things that will have *impact*."

### Work-in-Progress Bottlenecks

Too many simultaneous high-priority initiatives create context-switching, management overhead, and reduced throughput. WIP limits prove critical at organizational levels, not just team levels.

## Strategic Wisdom

Richard Rumelt's principle: "Good strategy works by focusing energy and resources on one, or a very few, pivotal objectives whose accomplishment will lead to a cascade of favorable outcomes."

Leadership must make difficult choices about which problems deserve concentrated attention—or strategic execution becomes impossible from the outset.

## DNA Mental™ Layer Markers

**Layer 1 - Mental Model:** Strategic focus as resource concentration (not distribution)
**Layer 2 - Thought Pattern:** Few pivotal objectives > Many important initiatives
**Layer 4 - Decision Architecture:** Constraint-based selection (what NOT to do)
**Layer 5 - Values:** Impact > Activity; Strategic choices > Stakeholder appeasement
**Layer 6 - Obsession:** The courage to say "no" to most things
**Layer 8 - Paradox:** Leaders believe they focus while maintaining 10x too many priorities
