## Release Slicing Overview

Once the story map is created, the team works through an exercise of "good, better, best" to determine various ways and levels of effort they could use to enable the desired user task. Finally the team works together to "slice" releases from the map that provide some level of customer value and reduce both upfront investment as well as time to market.

If done properly, user-story maps reveal logical and releasable slices of product increments that meet users' needs, while uncovering impacts and areas of risk ahead of development.

## The Walking Skeleton Concept

In story mapping, the stories placed high on the map describe the smallest possible system you could build that would give you end-to-end working functionality, which is what Agile specialist Alistair Cockburn refers to as a "walking skeleton."

### The Mona Lisa Metaphor

Jeff Patton uses a Mona Lisa metaphor where a pencil sketch represents the walking skeleton - it's just enough to see the shape and know where the positions of everything are, showing end-to-end functionality.

The functional walking skeleton helps you confirm early that you've found all the necessary functionality for the software - early enough to course-correct if you haven't.

## Incremental Delivery Approach

Patton describes building in layers:
1. **First layer**: Walking skeleton - end-to-end working functionality
2. **Next layer**: Broad brush strokes of form and shape
3. **Last layer**: Refinement and detail

As you grow the software iteratively and incrementally, you'll see it begin to tighten up and move closer to releasable.

## Target Outcomes for Slicing

The section on how to "slice" your story map into releases uses what Patton calls "target outcomes" to group stories by outcome underneath the larger backbone story elements.

This outcome-based slicing ensures each release delivers actual value rather than just completing arbitrary story batches.

## Good, Better, Best Exercise

Teams evaluate different levels of implementation:
- **Good**: Minimal viable approach
- **Better**: Enhanced version with more capability
- **Best**: Full-featured ideal state

This helps teams make conscious trade-offs between value delivery and time/effort investment.

## Value Slicing Principles

Story maps reveal:
- Logical release increments
- Customer value in each slice
- Impact areas and risks
- Dependencies and sequencing

The goal is to release value early and often, learning from user feedback with each increment.

## DNA Mental™ Layer Markers

**Layer 1 - Mental Model:** Walking skeleton + iterative refinement (not big-bang delivery)
**Layer 2 - Thought Pattern:** End-to-end value first, details later
**Layer 3 - Language:** Visual metaphors (Mona Lisa sketch, walking skeleton)
**Layer 4 - Decision Architecture:** Good/better/best evaluation framework
**Layer 5 - Values:** Early value delivery > Complete features; Learning velocity > Perfect planning
**Layer 7 - Singularity:** Walking skeleton as validation mechanism (catch missing functionality early)
