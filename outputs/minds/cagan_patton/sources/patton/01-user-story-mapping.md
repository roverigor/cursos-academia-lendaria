## Core Concept

User Story Mapping is fundamentally about visualizing how users interact with your product. As Patton explains, it's "a better way to work with Agile user stories" by having teams "talk about the user's journey through your product by building a simple model that tells your user's story."

## Key Principles

### Keeping Users Central

The methodology prioritizes user activities over feature debates. Rather than getting lost in arguments about specific features, teams maintain focus on what users actually do within the product.

### The Simple Approach

Patton describes the practice as "a dead simple idea" that paradoxically produces significant improvements. By organizing user stories in a map format that reflects the user journey, teams achieve better alignment.

## How It Works in Practice

The approach involves:
- Building a visual model of the user's journey
- Organizing user stories in narrative sequence
- Maintaining visibility of user goals and activities throughout development

## Story Mapping Structure

Story maps are structured with:
- **Activities** (the most general actions) displayed horizontally across the top
- **Steps** underneath each activity
- **Details** (the most specific actions) stacking vertically underneath their respective steps in priority order

User activities and steps display horizontally across the top of the map, and the details stack vertically underneath their respective steps in priority order.

## Workshop Process

To create a user story map, teams:
1. Start with the user journey by identifying the main activities users perform (forming the top row)
2. Break down into steps under each activity
3. Organize stories in priority order from top to bottom based on importance
4. Slice the MVP to define what is needed for the product's first version

## Resources Available

The methodology is supported by comprehensive materials including:
- A published book on the practice
- Original blog posts introducing the concept
- Quick reference guides for implementation
- Slide presentations for workshops
- Articles exploring related development practices

This framework encourages teams to think beyond isolated features and consider the complete user experience, ultimately producing more cohesive products that genuinely serve user needs.

## DNA Mental™ Layer Markers

**Layer 1 - Mental Model:** Story map as visual journey, not backlog
**Layer 2 - Thought Pattern:** User narrative flow over feature lists
**Layer 3 - Language:** "Dead simple idea" (accessible, visual, collaborative)
**Layer 5 - Values:** User activities > Features; Shared understanding > Documentation
**Layer 7 - Singularity:** Two-dimensional map as universal decomposition language
