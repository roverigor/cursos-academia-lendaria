## The Problem with Flat Backlogs

Jeff Patton argues that traditional flat user story backlogs are fundamentally flawed for product development. He uses a compelling metaphor: "We spend lots of time working with customers to understand their goals and the major system parts. Then we pull all the leaves off the tree and load them into a leaf bag."

According to Patton, flat backlogs fail in three critical ways:

### 1. Poor Communication

A flat backlog cannot effectively explain what a system does to stakeholders. When asked "what does the system do?", handing over a prioritized list of individual stories provides no coherent narrative.

### 2. Incomplete Planning

Without contextual organization, teams struggle to identify missing functionality. The lack of structural framework makes it difficult to feel confident that nothing major has been overlooked.

### 3. Tedious Prioritization

Managing hundreds of stories in a flat list creates exhausting, unproductive meetings where stakeholders make decisions in isolation.

## Patton's Famous Quote

"There's nothing more useless to a product team than a big backlog"

"Flat backlog is a dumb idea"

## The Story Map Solution

Patton proposes organizing user stories into a two-dimensional map structure:

### The Backbone

At the top sit "user activities"—the essential capabilities the system must have, arranged left-to-right in the order users encounter them. These form the system's structural foundation.

### The Skeleton

Below each activity hang smaller stories called "user tasks"—the detailed steps required to complete that activity. These are prioritized vertically by importance.

## Key Benefits

**Tells a System Story**: Walking through the map from left to right and top to bottom creates a narrative about user behavior and system functionality.

**Identifies the "Walking Skeleton"**: The highest-priority stories across all activities describe the minimum viable product—a complete, end-to-end system requiring "all the ribs," not just one feature in isolation.

**Enables Better Planning**: Release planning becomes clearer by determining which backbone items to prioritize and how deeply to build their characteristics.

**Serves as Communication**: Displayed as an information radiator, the map continuously reminds teams of the big picture while sprint cards track current work.

## A Proven Pattern

Patton notes this isn't an innovation but rather an emerging pattern he's observed others developing independently, citing parallels in Indi Young's Mental Models and Todd Warfel's Task Analysis Grid.

## DNA Mental™ Layer Markers

**Layer 1 - Mental Model:** 2D map > 1D list (structure reveals narrative)
**Layer 2 - Thought Pattern:** Context-rich organization over isolated prioritization
**Layer 3 - Language:** Strong metaphors ("leaf bag", "dumb idea"), direct critique
**Layer 5 - Values:** Systemic view > Feature isolation; Narrative coherence > Priority order
**Layer 6 - Obsession:** Visual structure as thinking tool
**Layer 7 - Singularity:** Story map as discovered pattern (not invented technique)
