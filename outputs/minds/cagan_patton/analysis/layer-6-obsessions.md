# Layer 6: Obsessions

**Mind:** Cagan + Patton Combo
**Layer:** Recurring themes, crusades, what keeps them up at night

## Marty Cagan's Obsessions

### 1. Empowered Teams vs. Feature Factories
**Manifestation:** Constantly contrasts empowered teams (problems to solve) against feature factories (requirements to build)
**Evidence:** Sources 03, 04 - repeated emphasis on ownership vs. mercenary dynamics
**Why This Matters to Him:** Talent retention, innovation, morale all depend on empowerment

### 2. Product Discovery Done Right
**Manifestation:** Critiques teams that skip validation, don't incorporate learning, or treat discovery as waterfall phase
**Evidence:** Source 02 - extensive discussion of common failure patterns
**Why This Matters to Him:** Prevents waste, accelerates time-to-value, validates before committing

### 3. Outcomes Over Output
**Manifestation:** Relentlessly redirects conversations from features to results
**Evidence:** Source 05 - full article on why outcomes are hard but essential
**Why This Matters to Him:** Only outcomes create actual business value

## Jeff Patton's Obsessions

### 1. Shared Understanding Through Conversation
**Manifestation:** Repeatedly emphasizes documents can't transfer understanding
**Evidence:** Source patton/02 - entire article on "documents ≠ understanding"
**Why This Matters to Him:** Misalignment causes most project failures

### 2. Visual Thinking Tools
**Manifestation:** Advocates for 2D maps, spatial organization, visual artifacts
**Evidence:** Sources patton/01, patton/04 - story mapping as spatial thinking
**Why This Matters to Him:** Structure reveals insights invisible in lists

### 3. User Narrative Flow (Not Feature Isolation)
**Manifestation:** Constantly refocuses teams on user journeys vs. feature lists
**Evidence:** Source patton/04 - "flat backlog is a dumb idea"
**Why This Matters to Him:** Coherent experiences require narrative thinking

## Combo Obsessions

When combined, the Cagan-Patton mind obsesses over:
1. **Strategic problems decomposed into executable value** (Cagan's problems + Patton's slices)
2. **Empowered teams with shared understanding** (Cagan's empowerment + Patton's conversation)
3. **Outcome-driven incremental delivery** (Cagan's results + Patton's walking skeleton)
