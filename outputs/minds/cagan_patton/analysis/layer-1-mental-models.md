## Overview

Mental models are the fundamental frameworks through which these thinkers interpret and structure reality. They represent the "invisible lenses" that shape how Cagan and Patton approach product work.

## Marty Cagan's Mental Models

### 1. Product Trio as Fundamental Unit

**Definition:** The irreducible unit of product work consists of product manager, designer, and engineer working in tight collaboration.

**Evidence:**
- Source 03: "Teams comprise...product manager, designer, and 2-10 developers"
- Source 07: "Three distinct competencies remain essential...Product managers navigate business constraints, Designers optimize user experience, Engineers solve technological challenges"

**Application:** All product decisions require these three perspectives. Separating them creates "mercenary" dynamics and reduces innovation.

**Persistence:** Even in AI future, Cagan maintains this model holds - teams may shrink to 3 people but the trio remains.

---

### 2. Discovery vs. Delivery (Unified Duality)

**Definition:** Product work has two continuous, simultaneous modes that must remain integrated within single teams.

**Evidence:**
- Source 04: "Discovery involves identifying customer problems, validating assumptions, and defining effective solutions. Delivery entails designing and engineering those solutions into actual products"
- Source 04: "Everyone participates in both spheres" while "emphasizing different activities"

**Application:**
- Discovery = Learn what to build (creative, uncertain, rapid cycles)
- Delivery = Build validated solutions (predictable, quality-focused)
- Anti-pattern: Separate teams for each

**Why This Model Matters:** Preserves ownership, enables innovation, maintains motivation

---

### 3. Opportunity Assessment as Filter Mechanism

**Definition:** Lightweight evaluation framework that prevents waste by validating opportunities before building.

**Evidence:**
- Source 01: "Ten Fundamental Questions" framework
- Source 01: "Choosing the right set of products to pursue is among the most important decisions"

**Structure:**
1. What problem? (value proposition)
2. For whom? (target market)
3. How big? (market size)
4. What alternatives? (competitive landscape)
5. Why us? (differentiation)
6. Why now? (timing)
7. How to market? (GTM strategy)
8. Success metrics? (measurement)
9. Critical factors? (success requirements)
10. Go/no-go? (recommendation)

**Application:** Gate before discovery begins - either prevents waste or clarifies success requirements

---

### 4. Strategic Focus as Resource Concentration

**Definition:** Strategy means concentrating on few pivotal objectives, not distributing across many initiatives.

**Evidence:**
- Source 06: "Good strategy works by focusing energy and resources on one, or a very few, pivotal objectives whose accomplishment will lead to a cascade of favorable outcomes" (Richard Rumelt, cited by Cagan)
- Source 06: "Leaders believe they practice good focus, yet maintain 20-30 'critically important' objectives simultaneously—roughly ten times more than actually feasible"

**Consequences of Violation:**
- Activity without impact
- Context-switching overhead
- WIP bottlenecks at org level
- Example: Pandora's decline from $16 IPO to acquisition

**Application:** Strategic courage to say "no" to most things

---

### 5. Outcomes as Consequence of System

**Definition:** Outcomes cannot be achieved by adding techniques (like OKRs) to output-based processes. They emerge from adopting the product model systemically.

**Evidence:**
- Source 05: "The OKR technique originated from, and is predicated upon, the product model"
- Source 05: "Outcomes are 'the consequence of' adopting the product model—not something that can exist independently"

**Application:** Don't layer OKRs onto feature factories - transform to product model first

## Jeff Patton's Mental Models

### 1. Story Map as 2D Thinking Tool

**Definition:** User stories organized in two-dimensional space (horizontal = user journey flow, vertical = priority) reveal system narrative invisible in flat backlogs.

**Evidence:**
- Source 04: "The Backbone: At the top sit 'user activities'...arranged left-to-right in the order users encounter them"
- Source 04: "The Skeleton: Below each activity hang smaller stories called 'user tasks'...prioritized vertically"
- Source 01: "Two-dimensional map as universal decomposition language"

**Why 2D > 1D:**
- Tells system story (narrative flow)
- Identifies missing functionality
- Enables better planning
- Serves as communication radiator

**Metaphor:** "We pull all the leaves off the tree and load them into a leaf bag" (critique of flat backlogs)

---

### 2. Shared Documents ≠ Shared Understanding

**Definition:** Documentation records conversations but cannot transfer understanding. Understanding emerges from conversation itself.

**Evidence:**
- Source 02: "Shared documents aren't shared understanding"
- Source 02: "When people share and sign off on documents, they might believe they understand although they have different interpretations"
- Source 02: "What you record during conversations works like a vacation photo - helping you remember details that aren't in the photo"

**Application:**
- Use cards to prompt conversation
- Document to aid memory, not replace conversation
- Story lifecycle: Card → Conversation → Confirmation

---

### 3. Walking Skeleton + Layered Refinement

**Definition:** Build end-to-end working functionality first (skeleton), then add detail in layers rather than completing features in isolation.

**Evidence:**
- Source 03: "Stories placed high on the map describe the smallest possible system you could build that would give you end-to-end working functionality" (Alistair Cockburn's Walking Skeleton)
- Source 03: "Mona Lisa metaphor where a pencil sketch represents the walking skeleton"
- Source 03: "First layer: Walking skeleton, Next layer: Broad brush strokes, Last layer: Refinement"

**Why This Works:**
- Confirms all necessary functionality found early
- Enables course-correction
- Delivers value incrementally
- Catches architectural issues

---

### 4. Backbone → Skeleton → Details Hierarchy

**Definition:** Product structure flows from high-level user activities (backbone) through essential tasks (skeleton) down to implementation details, maintaining hierarchical coherence.

**Evidence:**
- Source 01: "Activities (most general), steps, and details (most specific)"
- Source 04: "User activities and steps display horizontally across the top of the map, and the details stack vertically underneath"

**Application:** Organize thinking and planning hierarchically to maintain systemic view

---

### 5. Parallel Tracks, Not Sequential Phases

**Definition:** Discovery and delivery run simultaneously within one team, not as handoff between teams or sequential stages.

**Evidence:**
- Source 05: "The model is *not* a sequential handoff where discovery precedes development"
- Source 05: "Integrated approach where both activities occur concurrently"
- Source 05: "While a product manager, designer, and senior engineer may lead discovery, they must involve the whole team"

**Characteristics:**
- **Development work:** Predictability and quality focus
- **Discovery work:** Fast learning and validation focus
- **Integration:** One team, both tracks, continuous

## Combo Integration: How Models Combine

### Integrated Flow Model

```
Cagan's Opportunity Assessment (filter)
    ↓
Cagan's Strategic Focus (constrain to few pivotal problems)
    ↓
Cagan's Product Trio (empowered team assigned problem)
    ↓
Patton's Story Mapping (visual decomposition of solution)
    ↓
Patton's Walking Skeleton (end-to-end value first)
    ↓
Patton's Parallel Tracks (discovery loops + delivery rhythm)
    ↓
Cagan's Outcomes Focus (measure results, iterate)
```

### Complementary Strengths

| Dimension | Cagan Provides | Patton Provides |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Problem Space | Strategic filter, focus | User journey context |
| Solution Space | Empowered trio structure | Visual decomposition |
| Execution | Discovery-delivery unity | Incremental delivery model |
| Measurement | Outcome accountability | Value slicing |

### Shared Foundation

Both operate from:
- **Systems thinking:** See wholes, not isolated parts
- **User/customer centricity:** Solutions serve real needs
- **Anti-document bias:** Favor conversation, visualization, working software
- **Iterative learning:** Validate assumptions, course-correct
