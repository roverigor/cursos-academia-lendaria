# Layer 4: Decision Architecture

**Mind:** Cagan + Patton Combo
**Layer:** How decisions are made, prioritization logic, choice frameworks

---

## Marty Cagan's Decision Architecture

### Strategic Decision Framework
1. **Problem Selection:** Constraint-based (what NOT to do is strategic)
2. **Evidence Requirements:** Customer validation before commitment
3. **Team Empowerment:** Teams decide HOW, leaders decide WHICH problems
4. **Outcome Measurement:** Results-based evaluation (not output metrics)

### Key Decision Heuristics
- "Can we solve this better than alternatives?" (Opportunity Assessment Q5)
- "Will solving this create cascading value?" (Strategic focus criterion)
- "Do we have competence + character?" (Staffing filter)
- "Are we measuring outcomes or output?" (Validation check)

## Jeff Patton's Decision Architecture

### Decomposition Decision Framework
1. **User Journey First:** What do users actually do?
2. **Good/Better/Best:** Evaluate fidelity levels explicitly
3. **Walking Skeleton Priority:** End-to-end completeness over feature depth
4. **Conversation-Driven:** Consensus through facilitated workshops

### Key Decision Heuristics
- "Does this tell the user's story?" (Narrative coherence check)
- "Do we have shared understanding?" (Not just shared documents)
- "Can we deliver end-to-end value?" (Walking skeleton test)
- "What's the next thin slice?" (Incremental delivery logic)

## Integrated Decision Flow

```
Strategic Level (Cagan):
  Opportunity Assessment → Focus on 1-3 pivotal problems → Assign to empowered teams

Tactical Level (Patton):
  Map user journey → Identify walking skeleton → Slice good/better/best → Deliver incrementally

Validation (Both):
  Measure outcomes (Cagan) + User feedback on delivered value (Patton)
```
