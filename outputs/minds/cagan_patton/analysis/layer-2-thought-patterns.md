## Overview

Thought patterns are the **habitual ways of processing information** and approaching problems. While mental models (Layer 1) are the frameworks, thought patterns are the characteristic cognitive moves these thinkers make automatically.

---

## Marty Cagan's Thought Patterns

### 1. Strategic Questioning Before Building

**Pattern:** Always interrogate whether something should be built before discussing how to build it.

**Evidence:**
- Source 01: "Ask most product managers what problem their product is intended to solve, and you usually get a rambling list of features and capabilities, rather than a crisp, clear and compelling statement"
- Source 01: Opportunity Assessment's first question is problem definition, preceding all implementation discussion

**Manifestation:**
- Challenge assumptions
- Demand clarity on "why"
- Refuse to accept feature requests at face value
- Convert feature discussions into problem discussions

**Cognitive Move:** Feature request → "What problem does this solve?" → Problem validation → Solution discovery

---

### 2. Constraint-Based Selection (What NOT to Do)

**Pattern:** Strategic thinking focuses on elimination and constraint rather than addition and expansion.

**Evidence:**
- Source 06: "Leadership must make difficult choices about which problems deserve concentrated attention"
- Source 06: "Few pivotal objectives whose accomplishment will lead to a cascade of favorable outcomes"

**Manifestation:**
- Start with all options, eliminate most
- Identify the 1-3 pivotal objectives
- Say "no" as strategic act
- Constraint enables focus

**Cognitive Move:** Many possibilities → Strategic elimination → Few pivotal choices → Cascading outcomes

---

### 3. Evidence-Based Validation Before Commitment

**Pattern:** Validate assumptions with real customers/users before committing engineering resources.

**Evidence:**
- Source 02: "Teams identify whether real market demand exists and develop a usable, useful, and feasible solution"
- Source 02: "Criticizes teams that conduct interviews and prototype testing but fail to incorporate learnings before engineering begins building"
- Source 05: "Discovering what would make products genuinely valuable—so users willingly choose to use them—is the actual job"

**Manifestation:**
- Prototype before production
- Customer interviews inform design
- Rapid learning cycles
- Pivot based on evidence

**Cognitive Move:** Assumption → Rapid prototype → Customer validation → Iterate or commit

---

### 4. Systems-Level Impact Analysis

**Pattern:** Evaluate decisions at organizational system level, not isolated team level.

**Evidence:**
- Source 06: "WIP limits prove critical at organizational levels, not just team levels"
- Source 06: "Context-switching, management overhead, and reduced throughput"
- Source 04: "Separating discovery and delivery into distinct teams creates loss of ownership, reduced innovation, motivation decline"

**Manifestation:**
- Consider org-wide consequences
- Analyze cross-team dynamics
- Identify systemic bottlenecks
- Optimize for org throughput, not local efficiency

**Cognitive Move:** Local change → System impact analysis → Org-level optimization

---

### 5. Outcome Backward-Chaining

**Pattern:** Start with desired outcome, work backward to determine what would achieve it.

**Evidence:**
- Source 05: "Good teams know they're responsible for results or outcome, not output"
- Source 05: "Without demonstrated value to customers, teams waste months perfecting features nobody wants"

**Manifestation:**
- Begin with "what outcome do we need?"
- Identify metrics that matter
- Work backward from results to actions
- Refuse output-based success criteria

**Cognitive Move:** Desired outcome → Success metrics → Required solution characteristics → Discovery work

---

## Jeff Patton's Thought Patterns

### 1. Visual-Spatial Decomposition

**Pattern:** Convert abstract concepts and requirements into spatial, visual arrangements that reveal structure.

**Evidence:**
- Source 04: "Organizing user stories in a map format that reflects the user journey"
- Source 04: "2D structure reveals narrative complexity invisible in 1D lists"
- Source 01: "Building a visual model of the user's journey"

**Manifestation:**
- Draw before documenting
- Arrange spatially to reveal relationships
- Use physical/visual artifacts
- See patterns in spatial arrangement

**Cognitive Move:** Abstract requirement → Visual representation → Pattern recognition → Structural insight

---

### 2. Narrative Flow Thinking

**Pattern:** Organize information as user stories/journeys rather than feature lists or system capabilities.

**Evidence:**
- Source 01: "Talk about the user's journey through your product by building a simple model that tells your user's story"
- Source 04: "Walking through the map from left to right and top to bottom creates a narrative about user behavior and system functionality"

**Manifestation:**
- Start with user activities
- Sequence chronologically
- Maintain story coherence
- Think in episodes/journeys

**Cognitive Move:** System capabilities → User journey narrative → Chronological flow → Coherent story

---

### 3. Conversation-Driven Consensus Building

**Pattern:** Build understanding through facilitated conversation rather than documentation or presentation.

**Evidence:**
- Source 02: "User story conversations help everyone arrive at shared understanding much faster than reading a requirements document"
- Source 02: "Effective story conversations are about building shared understanding"

**Manifestation:**
- Facilitate workshops
- Use conversation prompts (cards)
- Build shared artifacts together
- Value consensus over specification

**Cognitive Move:** Individual interpretations → Facilitated conversation → Shared artifact creation → Collective understanding

---

### 4. Iterative Refinement (Good → Better → Best)

**Pattern:** Evaluate multiple levels of solution fidelity rather than seeking perfect answer immediately.

**Evidence:**
- Source 03: "Teams work through an exercise of 'good, better, best' to determine various ways and levels of effort"
- Source 03: "First layer: Walking skeleton, Next layer: Broad brush strokes, Last layer: Refinement"

**Manifestation:**
- Start with minimum viable
- Layer in refinement
- Compare fidelity levels
- Conscious trade-off evaluation

**Cognitive Move:** Problem → Minimal solution → Enhanced version → Ideal state → Conscious choice

---

### 5. End-to-End Value First

**Pattern:** Prioritize complete (though simple) flows over polished isolated features.

**Evidence:**
- Source 03: "Walking skeleton - end-to-end working functionality"
- Source 04: "Highest-priority stories across all activities describe the minimum viable product—a complete, end-to-end system requiring 'all the ribs'"

**Manifestation:**
- Build across full user journey first
- Avoid feature completion mentality
- Ensure integration points work
- Deliver thin vertical slices

**Cognitive Move:** Feature depth → Journey breadth → Skeleton completeness → Layered refinement

---

## Combo Integration: Combined Thought Patterns

### Integrated Problem-Solving Sequence

1. **Cagan: Strategic Questioning** - "Is this problem worth solving?"
2. **Cagan: Constraint-Based Selection** - "Which 1-3 problems deserve focus?"
3. **Patton: Visual Decomposition** - "Map the user journey visually"
4. **Patton: Narrative Flow** - "Tell the story chronologically"
5. **Cagan: Evidence-Based Validation** - "Validate with real users"
6. **Patton: Iterative Refinement** - "Good → Better → Best evaluation"
7. **Patton: End-to-End Value** - "Walking skeleton first"
8. **Cagan: Outcome Measurement** - "Are we achieving results?"

### Complementary Processing Styles

| Dimension | Cagan's Processing | Patton's Processing | Combo Strength |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Problem Space** | Analytical elimination | Visual exploration | Filter then map |
| **Solution Space** | Evidence validation | Collaborative refinement | Validate then decompose |
| **Execution** | Outcome measurement | Incremental delivery | Measure value delivered |
| **Decision-Making** | Strategic constraint | Consensus building | Focus via collaboration |

### When Patterns Conflict (Productive Tension)

**Tension:** Cagan's constraint vs. Patton's exploration

**Example:**
- Cagan: "We can only work on 3 objectives"
- Patton: "Let's map all user journeys to see what we're missing"

**Resolution:**
- Use strategic constraint to bound the problem space
- Use visual exploration within those bounds to discover solutions
- One constrains WHAT problems; the other explores HOW to solve

- **Systems analyzer:** Evaluates org-level dynamics
- **Evidence demander:** No faith without validation

### How Patton Thinks Differently

- **Spatial visualizer:** Understanding emerges from visual arrangement
