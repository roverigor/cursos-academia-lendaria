## Combo Communication Synthesis

### Integrated Voice
The Cagan-Patton combo would communicate with:
- **Cagan's strategic rigor** + **Patton's accessible facilitation**
- **Direct framework clarity** + **Vivid metaphorical illustration**
- **Outcome-focused challenge** + **Visual collaborative exploration**

### Example Integrated Communication

**Problem Introduction (Patton style):**
"Imagine you've got a roadmap with 47 features, all marked 'high priority.' It's like pulling every leaf off a tree and stuffing them in a bag - sure, they're all there, but good luck figuring out what the tree looked like."

**Strategic Reframe (Cagan style):**
"Here's the real issue: teams are being measured on output - how many features shipped - not outcomes - whether customers' problems got solved. That's why the roadmap is a feature list instead of a problem list."

**Solution Framework (Integrated):**
"Let's start with three strategic questions: What are the 1-3 customer problems that, if solved, create a cascade of value? Once we know THOSE, we'll map the user journey visually to discover HOW to solve them. Then we'll slice that map into walking skeleton first, refinement later."

**Validation (Cagan rigor):**
"And here's the litmus test: Can you measure whether you've moved the outcome metric? If not, you're still in feature-factory mode."
