brett would you say that a scientific
theory is a subset of a good explanation
yes they're the testable kinds of good
explanations
falsifiable theories are actually a dime
a dozen
this doesn't tell you anything about the
quality of the explanation you're being
given
the example that's used in the fabric of
reality is the grass cure for the common
cold
if someone comes along to you and says
if you eat 1.0
kilograms of grass it will cure your
common cold
they have a testable theory the problem
is that no one should test it
why because they haven't given you an
explanation as to what the mechanism is
that would enable grass to cure the
common cold
and if you do eat the 1.0 kilograms of
grass
and it doesn't cure your cold they can
turn around and say
1.1 kilograms might do it right or you
need a different kind of grass
or you need to always do it on a
different day it's always testable
but you're not getting anywhere you're
not making any progress so i think the
second piece of good explanation is hard
to vary it has to be very
precise and there must be a good reason
for the precision the famous example he
used in the beginning of infinity is the
why do we have seasons on the earth and
there was the old greek explanation well
it's driven by persephone the goddess of
spring that's when she can leave
hades and there's this whole theory
involving gods and goddesses
not only was that not easily testable it
was very easy to vary persephone could
have been nike
and hades could have been jupiter or
zeus it's very easy to vary that
explanation
without the predictions changing whereas
if you look at the axis tilt theory of
saying the earth is angled at 23 degrees
relative to the sun and
therefore would expect the sun to rise
here in the winter and over there in the
summer
the facts on that are very hard to vary
it makes risky and narrow predictions
they can predict the exact length of
summer and winter at different
latitudes and you can test that very
precisely so
beyond it being a creative theory that
is testable and falsifiable
it should be hard to vary the pieces of
that theory without essentially
destroying that theory and you certainly
don't want to vary it after the fact
like your grass example oh it was one
kilogram now it's 1.1 now it's 1.2
finally the predictions that it makes
should be very narrow and precise and
they should be risky
for example i believe in relativity was
it eddington who did the experiment and
showed that star light gets bent around
the eclipse
and that was a prediction that einstein
had made in relativity which turned out
to be true
that was a risky prediction that took a
long time to confirm
