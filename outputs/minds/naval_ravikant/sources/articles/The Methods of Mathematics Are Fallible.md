if i quickly compare it to physics we
have this domain called particle physics
and the deepest theory we have in
particle physics is called the standard
model which describes
all of the different fundamental
particles that there are and the
interactions between these fundamental
particles
the forces that exist between them and
the gauge bosons which
mediate the force between particles like
electrons
protons and neutrons now what is matter
made of
we would say matter is made of these
particles the particles described
by the standard model of physics but
does that rule out
the fact that these fundamental
particles might themselves consist of
even smaller particles
we have this idea of string theory so
our knowledge of what
the most fundamental particles are and
what in reality
the most fundamental particles are is
different so too in mathematics
deutsche explains that mathematics is a
field where what we're trying to uncover
is necessary truth
the subject matter of mathematics is
necessary truth
in the same way that the subject matter
of particle physics
are the fundamental particles but
because the subject matter of
fundamental particle physics are the
fundamental particles that doesn't mean
you actually find the fundamental
particles
all it means is that you have found the
smallest particles that your biggest
particle accelerators are able to
resolve
but if you had an even bigger particle
accelerator you might find particles
within those particles this has been the
history of particle physics by the way
we used to think that atoms were
fundamental
then of course we found that they
contain nuclei and electrons
in the nuclei we found out there were
protons and neutrons inside the protons
and neutrons we found out they were made
up of quarks and that's where we're at
right now
we're at the point where we say that the
quarks are fundamental and the electrons
are fundamental
but that doesn't mean that we're going
to end particle physics right now
what we need are further theories about
what
might be inside of those really small
particles
comparing that to mathematics if
necessary truth is the subject matter of
mathematics
our knowledge of that necessary truth is
what mathematicians
are engaged in they're engaged in
creating knowledge about
necessary truth and because a
mathematician
has a brain which is a physical object
and all physical objects are subject to
making errors of degradation via the
second law of thermodynamics or simply
just
the usual mental mistakes and errors
that any
human being makes a mathematician is
just as fallible as anyone else
then what they end up proving could
be an error so if i understand this
point even mathematics is capable of
error
because mathematics is a creative act
we're never quite done
there could have been a mistake in your
axiom somewhere ultimately even
mathematics the creative act and can
have
error within it
