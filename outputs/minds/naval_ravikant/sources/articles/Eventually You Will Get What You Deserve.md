we're still talking about working for
the long term the next tweet on that
topic is apply specific knowledge with
leverage and eventually you will get
what you deserve I would also add to
that apply judgment apply accountability
and apply the skill of reading this one
is just a glib way of saying that it
takes time even once you have all of
these pieces in place there is an
indeterminate amount of time that you're
gonna have to put in and if you're
counting you will run out of patience
before it actually arrives so you just
have to make sure that you give these
things a proper time life is long
Charlie Munger had some line on this
somebody asked him about making money
and he reinterpreted that and he said
what the questioner is actually asking
is how do I get rich like you but faster
before I end up as an really old guy and
everybody wants it immediately but the
world is an efficient place immediate
doesn't work you do have to put in the
time you do have to put in the hours and
so I think you just have to put yourself
in the position with the specific
knowledge with the accountability with
the leverage with the authentic skill
set that you have to be the best in the
world at what you do and then you have
to enjoy it and just keep doing it and
keep doing it and keep doing it and
don't keep track and don't keep count
because if you do you will run out of
time I can look back at my career and
the people two decades ago that I had
identified as brilliant and hard-working
but I hadn't thought much more about it
they're all successful now almost
without exception on a long enough time
scale you do get paid but it can easily
be 10 or 20 years sometimes is five and
if it's five or three and a friend of
yours got there it can drive you insane
but those are exceptions and for every
winner there's multiple failures one
thing that's important in
entrepreneurship is you just have to be
right once you get many many shots on
goal you can take a shot on goal every
three to five years maybe every ten at
the slowest or once every year at the
fastest depending on how you're
iterating with startups but you really
only have to be right once my little
equation is that your eventual outcome
will be equal to something like the
distinctiveness of your specific
knowledge times how much leverage you
can apply to that knowledge times how
often your judgment is correct
times how singularly accountable you are
for the outcome times how much society
values what you're doing and then you
compound all of that with how long you
can keep doing it and how long you can
keep improving it through reading and
learning that's actually a really good
way to summarize it it's probably worth
even trying to sketch that equation out
that said people try to then apply
mathematics to what is really philosophy
so I've seen this happen in the past
where I say one thing and then I say
another thing that seemed contradictory
if you treat as a math equation but it's
obviously in a different context and
then people will say well you say that
desire is suffering that's the Buddhist
saying and then you say that all
greatness comes from suffering so does
that mean all greatness comes from
desire and cycle this is in math people
you can't just start carrying variables
around and forming absolute logical
outputs you have to know when to apply
things so I think that is very useful to
understand but at the same time one
can't get too analytical about it it's
what a physicist would call false
precision when you take two made-up
estimates and you multiply them together
and you get four degrees of precision
those decimal points don't actually
count you don't have that data you don't
have that knowledge in a model the more
estimated variables you have the greater
the error in the model so just adding
more and more complexity to your
decision-making process actually gets
you a worse answer you're better off
just picking the single biggest thing or
- for example what am I really good at
according to observation and according
to people that I trust that the market
values like that alone those two
variables alone are probably good enough
because if you're good at it you'll keep
it up and if you're good at it you
develop the judgment and if you're good
at it and you like to do it eventually
people will give you the resources and
you won't be afraid to take on
accountability so all the other pieces
will fall in place product market fit is
inevitable if you're doing something you
love to do and the market wants it
