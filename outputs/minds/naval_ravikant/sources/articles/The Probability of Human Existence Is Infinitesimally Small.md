here's another way to think about it
that is mathematically frightening for
the people who think that the aliens are
out there and they're going to visit us
at some time in the future we were
talking earlier about trillions of
planets that exist throughout the known
universe that might even be friendly for
life to arise
imagine that between
us as intelligent human beings and the
most simple form of bacteria that we can
imagine
there are only 100 independent
evolutionary steps now that's not true
it's probably a million or more
different mutations that had to happen
and were favorable allow any organism to
survive such that we exist today but
just make it only a hundred and imagine
that each of those independent steps had
a probability of just one in 10 of
happening now in fact it's probably more
like one in a million but we'll be
generous we'll say one in ten so now
what we have is a chain of probability
one in ten times one in ten times one in
ten a hundred times and if you know how
to do mathematics you'll realize that
this is 1 over 10 all to the power of
100 which is 1 over 1 followed by a 100
zeros that number
swamps the astronomical number i was
talking about with planets earlier on in
other words the probability of us
arising on this particular argument is
infinitesimally small
the fact that it's happened once should
blow our minds
