accountability is important because
that's how you're going to get leverage
that's how you're going to get
credibility it's also how you're going
to get equity you're gonna get a piece
of the business when you're negotiating
with other people ultimately if someone
else is making a decision about how to
compensate you that decision will be
based on how replaceable you are and if
you have high accountability that makes
you less replaceable and then they have
to give you equity which is a piece of
the upside but equity itself is a good
example because equity is also a risk
based instrument equity means you get
paid everything after all the people who
need guaranteed money are paid back so
if you look at the hierarchy of capital
in a company the employees get paid
first they get to pay the salary first
like in the legal proceedings you know
the salaries are sacrosanct if you are a
board member and the company spends too
much money and has back salaries to pay
the government will go after you
personally to pay back the salaries so
the employees get the most security but
in exchange for that security they don't
have as much upside then next in line
would be the debt holders who are maybe
the bankers who lent money to the
company for operations and they need to
make their fixed coupon every month or
every year but they don't get much more
upside beyond that now they might be
making 5 10 15 20 25 percent a year but
that's where they're upset is limited to
and then finally are the equity holders
and these people are actually gonna get
most of the upside so once the debt
holders are paid off and the salaries
are paid off whatever remains goes to
them but if there isn't enough money to
pay off the salaries and the debt
holders or if there's just enough to pay
off the salary the debt holders which is
what happens with most businesses most
of the times the equity holders get
nothing so the equity holders take on
greater risk but then they take on in
exchange they get nearly unlimited
upside and you can do the same with all
of your work so essentially taking
accountability for your actions is the
same as taking an equity position in all
of your work you're essentially taking
greater downside risk and greater upside
risk but realize that in modern society
the downside risk is not that large you
know even personal bankruptcy can wipe
the debts clean in good ecosystems I'm
most familiar with Silicon Valley but
generally people will forgive
failures as long as you are honest and
made a high integrity effort so there's
not really that much to fear in terms of
failure and so people should be taking
on a lot more accountability than they
actually are is accountability actually
fragile or do you really just mean that
we're hardwired not to fail in public so
it just feels like it's a fragile thing
I think it could actually be fragile the
example of accountability is you're an
airplane pilot but as a captain you're
taking on accountability for the entire
plane let's say that something goes
wrong with the aircraft you can't let
her play MIT on anyone else you can't
blame it on the steward or the
stewardess you can't blame it on the
copilot you're the captain you're
responsible for the ship and if you
screw up you crash the ship and there
are immediate consequences in the old
days you know the captain was expected
to go down with the ship if the ship was
sinking literally the last person who
got to get off was the captain so yeah I
think accountability does come with real
risks but we're talking about in a
business context so the risk here would
be that you would probably be the last
one to get your capital back out you'd
be the last one to get paid for your
time so you know the time that you put
in the capital that you put in into the
company these are what are at risk even
if a business fails and your names on it
that's not as bad as if it turns out to
an integrity issue like your Bernie
Madoff for example Madoff investments
that name is never going to be good
again in the investment community you
could be Bernie Madoff's
great-great-great-grandson you are not
gonna go into the investment business
because you ruin the family name
so I think these days the accountability
risk with the name happens more around
integrity rather it does around purely
economic failure the big takeaway for me
on accountability is that you will be
rewarded directly in proportion with
your accountability I also think this is
why people like tala
rail against CEOs who get rewards
without accountability yeah I mean Telep
skin in the game is required reading if
you want to get anywhere in modern life
and understand how modern systems work
then a scale of the game would be near
top of my list to read but yes
accountability skin of the game these
concepts go very closely hand-in-hand
I think of accountability as
reputational
in the game it's putting your personal
reputation on the line as skin in the
game accountability is a simple concept
the only part of accountability that
maybe a little counterintuitive is that
we're currently socially brainwashed to
not take on accountability not in a
visible way but I think there are ways
to take on accountability where every
member of a team can take on
accountability for their portion and
that is how you get a well-functioning
team while still putting credits and
losses in the correct columns
