overall capitalism is intrinsic to the
human species capitalism is not
something we invented capitalism is not
even something we discovered it is
innate to us in every exchange that we
have when you and I exchange information
I want some information back from you I
give you information you give me
information if we weren't having a good
information exchange you go talk to
somebody else so the notion of exchange
and keeping track of credits and debits
this is built into us as flexible social
animals we are the only animals in the
animal kingdom that cooperate across
genetic boundaries most animals doesn't
cooperate but when they do they
cooperate only in packs where they Co
evolve together and they share blood so
they have some shared interest humans
don't have that I can cooperate with you
guys one of you is a Serbian the other
one is a Persian by origin and I'm
Indian by origin we have very little
blood in common basically none but we
still cooperate and what lets us
cooperate it's because we can keep track
of debits and credits who put in how
much work who contributed how much
that's all free market capitalism is so
I strongly believe that it is innate to
the human species and we are going to
create more and more wealth and
abundance for everybody everybody can be
wealthy everybody can be retired
everybody can be successful it is merely
a question of Education and desire you
have to want it if you don't want it
that's fine then you opt out of the game
but don't try and put down the people
who are playing the game because that's
the game that keeps you in a comfortable
warm bed at night that's the game that
keeps a roof over your head that's a
game that keeps your supermarket's stock
that's the game that keeps the iphone
buzzing in your pocket so it is a
beautiful game that is worth playing
ethically rationally morally socially
for the human race and it's gonna
continue to make us all richer and
richer until we have massive wealth
creation for anybody who wants it and
it's not just individual secretly
despising wealth right there's countries
groups political parties that overtly
despise wealth or at least same to you
that's right and so what those countries
political parties and groups are reduced
playing the zero-sum king of status and
the process to destroy wealth creation
they dragged everybody down to their
level which is why the u.s. is a very
popular country for immigrants because
it's the American dream
anyone can come here Precor and then
work really hard and make money and get
wealthy but you know even just make some
basic money for their lives
obviously the definition of wealth is
different for different people a virtual
of citizens definition of wealth might
be I'll have to make millions of dollars
and I'm completely done
where's to a third world poor immigrant
just entering the country and we were
poor immigrants who came here when I was
fairly young to the United States wealth
may just be a much lower number it may
just be that I don't have to work a
manual labor job for the rest of my life
that I don't want work but groups that
despise it will essentially bring the
entire group down to that level if you
get too many takers and not enough
makers society falls apart you end up
with a communist country luckily benna's
whele right they were so busy taking and
dividing and reallocating that people
are literally starving in the streets
and losing kilograms of body weight
every year just from sheer starvation
another way think about it imagine an
organism that has too many parasites you
actually need some small number of
parasites to stay healthy and you meet a
lot of symbiosis like all the
mitochondria in all of our cells that
help us respirate and burn oxygen these
are symbols that help us survive we can
survive without them but to me those are
partners in the wealth creation that
creates the human body but if you just
were filled with parasites if you've got
infected with worms or a virus or
bacteria that were purely parasitical
you would die so any organism can only
withstand a small number of parasites
and when the parasitic element gets too
far out of control you die so you know
that again I'm talking about ethical
wealth patient and the time of
monopolies in the time of crony
capitalism I'm not talking about miss
price externalities like the environment
I'm talking about free minds and free
markets small-scale exchange between
humans that's voluntary and doesn't have
an outsize impact on others but I think
that kind of wealth creation if a
society does not respect it if a group
does not respect it that society will
plunge into ruin and darkness
