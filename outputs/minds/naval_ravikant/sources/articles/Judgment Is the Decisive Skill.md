we spoke about specific knowledge we
talked about accountability we talked
about leverage the last skill that
navall talks about in his tweet storm is
judgment where he says that leverage is
a force multiplier for your judgment we
are now living in an age of nearly
infinite leverage and all the great
fortunes are created through leverage so
your first job is to go and obtain
leverage and you can obtain leverage
through permission by taking risks and
getting people to work for you or by
raising capital or you can get leverage
permissionless lee by learning how to
code or becoming good communicator and
podcasting and broadcasting creating
videos writing etc so that's how you get
leverage but once you have leverage what
do you do with it well the first part a
career spent hustling to get leverage
once you have the leverage then you want
to slow down a bit because your judgment
really matters it's like you've gone
from steering your sailboat around to
now you're steering an ocean liner or a
tanker you have a lot more at risk but
you have a lot more to gain as well
you're carrying a much higher payload so
an age of infinite leverage judgment
becomes the most important skill Warren
Buffett is so wealthy now because of his
judgment even if you were to take away
all of Warren's money tomorrow investors
would come out of the woodwork and hand
him a hundred billion dollars because
they know his judgment is so good and
they would give him a big chunk of that
hundred billion dollars to invest so
ultimately everything else that you do
is actually setting you up to apply your
judgment one of the big things that
people rail on a CEO pay and for sure
there's crony capitalism that goes on
where these CEOs control their boards
and the boards give them too much money
but there's certain CEOs who definitely
earn their keep because their judgment
is better if you're steering a big ship
if you're steering Google or Apple and
your judgment is 10 or 20 percent better
than the next person's Society will
literally pay you hundreds of millions
of dollars more because you're steering
a hundred billion dollar ship if you are
on course ten or twenty percent of the
time more often the other person the
compounding results on that hundreds of
billions of dollars you're managing will
be so large that your CEO pay will be
dwarfed in comparison so demonstrated
judgment credibility around the judgment
is so critical Warren Buffett wins here
because he has
massive credibility he's been highly
accountable he's been right over and
over in the public domain he's built a
reputation for very high integrity so
you can trust him
so a person like that people will throw
infinite leverage behind him because of
his judgment nobody asked him how hard
he works nobody asked him when he wakes
up or when he goes to sleep did like
Warren just do your thing
so especially demonstrated judgment with
high accountability clear track record
is critical let's define judgment I
would define it as knowing the long-term
effects of your decisions or being able
to predict the long-term effects your
decisions it's funny my definition of
wisdom is knowing the long-term
consequences of your actions they're not
all that different wisdom is just
judgment on a personal domain wisdom
applied to external problems I think is
judgment so they're they're highly
linked but yes it's knowing the
long-term consequences of your actions
and then making kind of the right
decision to capitalize on that judgment
is very hard to build up this is where
both intellect and experience come into
play there are many problems with the
so-called
intellectuals in the ivory tower but one
of the reasons why I must seem to lab
rails against them is because they have
no skin in the game they have no
real-world experience right so they just
apply purely intellect and intellect
without any experience is often worse
than useless because you get the
confidence that the intellect gives you
and you get some of the credibility but
because you had no skin in the game and
you had no real experience and no real
accountability you're just throwing
darts the real world is always far far
more complex than we can intellectualize
and especially all the interesting
fast-moving edge domains and problems
you can't get there without experience
so if you are smart and you iterate fast
it's not even you put 10,000 hours into
something but you take 10,000 tries at
something if you are smart and you have
a lot of quick iterations and you try to
keep your emotions out of it the people
with the best judgment are actually
among the least emotional a lot of the
best investors are considered almost
robotic in that regard but I would be
surprised if even the best entrepreneurs
often come across as unemotional there
is sort of this archetype of the
passionate entrepreneur and yeah they
have to care about what they're doing
but they also have to
see very clearly what's actually
happening and the thing that prevents
you from seeing what's actually
happening or your emotions our emotions
are constantly clouding our judgment and
investing or in running companies or in
building products or being an
entrepreneur emotions really get in the
way
emotions that were preventing you from
seeing what's actually happening until
you can no longer resist the truth of
what's happening until it becomes too
sudden and then you're forced into
suffering which is sort of a breaking of
this emotional fantasy that you would
put together to try and connect some of
these concepts I would say that first
you're accountable for your judgement
judgement is the exercise of wisdom
wisdom comes from experience and that
experience can be accelerated through
short iterations and the reason why a
lot of the top investors a lot of the
value investors if you read Jeremy
Grantham where you read Warren Buffett
you know you read up on Michael burry
these people sound like philosophers or
they are philosophers or they're reading
a lot of history books or science books
like what are they doing shouldn't they
be reading investment books no
investment books or the worst place to
learn about investment because
investment is a real-world activity that
is highly multivariate all the
advantages are always being competed
away it's always in the cutting edge so
what you actually just need is very very
broad-based judgment and thinking and
the best way to do that is to study
everything including a lot of philosophy
and philosophy also makes you more stoic
makes you less emotional and so you make
better decisions you have better
judgment one simple thing is I see that
go out on Twitter and it seems like half
of Twitter is outrageous something at
all times
you can go within someone's Twitter feed
and get at least some semblance of what
it must be like to be in their head all
the time and the more outrage somebody
is I guarantee you the worse the
judgment is if someone's constantly
tweeting political outrage and it seems
like an angry person getting into fights
you don't want to hand these person the
keys to your car let alone the keys to
your company
