yeah I think there's this notion that
making money is evil right it's like
rooted all the way back down to money's
the root of all evil people think that
the bankers steal our money and you know
it's somewhat true in that in a lot of
the world there's a lot of theft going
on all the time the history of the world
in some sense is this predator-prey
relationship between makers and takers
there are people who go out and create
things and build things and work hard on
things and then there are people who
come along and plead with a sword or a
gun or taxes or crony capitalism or
communism or what have you there's all
these different methods to steal even in
nature there are more parasites than
there are non parasitical organisms you
have ton of parasites in you who are
living off of you and the better whether
symbiotic and giving something back but
there are a lot that are just taking
that's just the nature of how any
complex system is built but what I am
basically focused on is true wealth
creation it's not about taking money
it's not about taking something from
somebody else but it's when creating
abundance obviously there's not a finite
number of jobs or a finite amount of
wealth otherwise we will still be
sitting around in caves figuring out how
to divide a pieces of firewood and you
know the occasional dead deer so most of
the wealth and civilization in fact not
most basically all of it has been
created and it got created from
somewhere it got created from people
they got create from technology a
critical productivity got created from
hard work so this idea that if stolen is
I think this horrible zero-sum game that
people who are trying to gain status
play but the reality is everyone can be
rich and we can see that by seeing that
in the first world everyone is basically
richer than almost anyone who was alive
200 years ago 200 years ago nobody had
any biotics nobody had cars nobody had
electricity nobody had the iPhone so all
of these things are inventions that had
made us wealthier as a species today I
would rather be a poor person in the
first world country than be a rich
person in Luise 14th France I'd rather
be a poor person today than aristocrat
back then and that's just because of
wealth creation the engine of
technologies science that is applied for
the purpose of creating abundance so I
think fundamentally everybody can be
wealthy and the thought experiment I
want you to think through is imagine if
every
buddy had the knowledge of a good
software engineer and a good hardware
engineer if you could go out there and
you could build robots and computers and
bridges and program them let's say every
human knew how to do that what do you
think society would look like in 20
years my guess is what would happen is
we would build robots machines software
and hardware to do everything and we
would all be living in massive abundance
we would essentially be retired in the
sense that none of us would have to work
for any of the basics we'd even have
robotic nurses we have like machine
driven hospitals we'd have self-driving
cars we'd have farms that are a hundred
percent automated we'd have clean energy
so at that point we could use the
technology breakthroughs to get
everything that we wanted and if anyone
is still working at that point they're
working as a form of expressing their
creativity they're working because it's
in them to contribute and to build and
design things so I don't think
capitalism is evil capitalism is
actually good it's just that it gets
hijacked it gets hijacked by improper
pricing of externalities it gets
hijacked by improper deals where that
you basically have corruption or you
have monopolies
