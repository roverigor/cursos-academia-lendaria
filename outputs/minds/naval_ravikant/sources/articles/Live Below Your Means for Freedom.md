any other big things you should avoid
other than renting out your time yeah
there are two tweets that I put out that
are related so the first one is talking
about queer or something like how it
your lifestyle you know has to upgrade
shouldn't get upgraded too fast and that
one basically said people who are living
far below their means enjoy a freedom
that people busy upgrading their
lifestyles just can't fathom and I think
that's very important like just to not
upgrade your lifestyle all the time to
maintain your freedom it just gives you
a freedom of operation you basically
once you make a little bit of money you
still want to be living like your old
self so that's just the worry goes away
so don't want to upgrade that house
lifestyle and all that stuff let's say
you're gonna pay the thousand dollars an
hour the problem is that when you go
into a work lifestyle like that you
don't just suddenly go from making
twenty dollars an hour to making a
thousand dollars an hour that's a
progression over a long career and as
that happens one subtle problem is that
you upgrade your lifestyle as you make
more and more money and that upgrading
of the lifestyle kind of ups what you
consider to be wealth and you stay in
this wage slave trap so I forget who
said it maybe it was nothing too late
but he said you know the most dangerous
things are heroin and a monthly salary
right because they're highly addictive
the way you want to get wealthy is you
want to be poor and working and working
and working and this is for example how
the tech industry works well you don't
make any money for ten years and then
suddenly in year 11 you might have a
giant payday which is what by the way
one reason why these very high marginal
tax rates for the so-called wealthy or
flawed because the highest risk-taking
most creative professions you literally
lose money for a decade of your life
while you take massive risk and you
bleed and bleed and bleed and then
suddenly in year 11 or year 15 you might
have one single big payday but then of
course Uncle Sam show up and basically
say hey you know what you just made a
lot of money this year therefore you're
rich therefore you're evil and you got
to hand it all over to us so it just
destroys those kinds of creative
risk-taking professions but ideally you
want to make your money in discrete
lumps separated over long periods of
time so that your own lifestyle does not
have a chance to adapt quickly and then
you can basically say okay now I'm done
now I'm retired now I'm free I'm still
gonna work because you gotta do
with your life but I'm gonna work on
only the things that I want when I want
and it's gonna be much more creative
expression and much less about money
