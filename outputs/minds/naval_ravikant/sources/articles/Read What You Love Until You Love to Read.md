before we go and talk about
accountability and leverage and judgment
you've got a few tweets further down the
line that I would put in the category of
continuous learning they're essentially
there is no skill called business avoid
business magazines in business class
study microeconomics game theory
psychology persuasion ethics mathematics
and computers there's one other comment
that you made in a periscope that was
you should be able to pick up any book
in the library and read it and the last
tweet in this category was reading is
faster than listening doing is faster
than watching yeah the most important
tweet on this I don't even have in here
unfortunately which is the foundation of
learning is reading I don't know a smart
person who doesn't read and read all the
time and the problem is what do I read
how do I read because for most people to
struggle it's at shore so the most
important thing is just to learn how to
educate yourself and the way to educate
yourself is to develop a love for
reading so the tweet that is left out
the one that I was hinting yet is read
what you love until you love to read
it's that simple everybody I know who
reads a lot loves to read and they love
to read because they read books that
they loved it's a little bit of a
catch-22 but you basically want to start
off just reading wherever you are and
then keep building up from there until
the reading becomes a habit and then
eventually you will just get bored of
the simple stuff so you may start off
reading fiction then you might graduate
to science fiction then you may graduate
to nonfiction then you may graduate to
science or philosophy or mathematics or
whatever it is but take your natural
path and just read the things that
interest you until you kind of
understand them and then you'll
naturally move to the next thing and the
next thing and the next thing now there
is an exception to this which is where I
was hinting with what things you
actually do want to learn which is at
some point there's too much out there to
read and even reading is full of junk
there are actually things you can read
especially early on that will program
your brain a certain way and then later
things that you read you will decide
whether those things were true or false
based on the earlier things so it is
important that you read foundational
things and foundational things I would
say are the original books in a given
field
that are very scientific in their nature
so for example instead of reading a
business book pick up Adam Smith's The
Wealth of Nations instead of reading a
book on biology or evolution that's
written today I would pick up Darwin's
Origin of Species instead of reading a
book on biotech right now that may be
very advanced I would just pick up the
eighth day of creation by Watson and
Crick instead of reading advanced focus
on what cosmology and what Neil deGrasse
Tyson and Stephen Hawking have been
saying you can pick up Richard Fineman
six easy pieces that start with basic
physics if you understand the basics
especially in mathematics and physics
and sciences then you will not be afraid
of any book all of us have that memory
of when we were sitting in class and
we're learning mathematics and it was
all logical and all made sense until at
one point the class moved too fast and
we fell behind and then after that we
were left memorizing equations
memorizing concepts without being able
to drive them from first principles and
that moment were lost because unless
you're professional mathematicians you
are not gonna remember those things all
you're gonna remember are the techniques
the foundations so you have to make sure
that you're building on a steel frame of
understanding because you're putting
together a foundation for a skyscraper
and you're not just memorizing things
because if you're just memorizing things
you're lost
so the foundations are ultra important
and the ultimate the ultimat is when you
walk into a library and you look at it
up and down and you don't fear any book
you know that you can take any book off
the shelf you can read it you can
understand it you can absorb what is
true you can reject what is false and
you have a basis for even working that
out that is logical and scientific and
not purely just based on opinions the
beauty of the Internet is the entire
Library of Alexandria times 10 is at
your fingertips at all times it's not
the means of education or the means of
learning our scarce the means of
learning are abundant it's the desire to
learn that scarce so you really have to
cultivate that desire and it's not even
cultivating if did not lose it children
have a natural curiosity if you go to a
young child who's first learning
language they're pretty much always
asking what's this what's that why is
this who's that they're always asking
Christ
but one of the problems is that schools
and our educational system and even our
way of raising children replaces
curiosity with compliance and once you
replace the curiosity with the
compliance you get an obedient factory
worker but you no longer get a creative
thinker and you need creativity you need
that ability to feed your own brain to
learn whatever you want
