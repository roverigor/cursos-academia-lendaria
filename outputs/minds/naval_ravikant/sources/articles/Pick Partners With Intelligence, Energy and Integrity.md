in terms of pick people to work with
that I have high intelligence high
energy and high integrity I find that's
the three part checklist that you cannot
compromise on you need someone who's
smart or they're heading in the wrong
direction and you're not gonna end up in
the right place you need someone high
energy because the world is full of
smart lazy people we all know people in
our life are really smart but you know
can't get out of bed or lift a finger
and we also know people have a very high
energy but not that smart so they work
hard but they're short of running in the
wrong direction and smart it's not a
pejorative it's not meant to be like
someone smart someone else is stupid but
it's more than everyone's smart at
different things so depending on what
you want to do well you have to find
someone who's smart at that thing and
then energy a lot of times people are
unmotivated for a specific thing but
they're not motivated for other things
so for example someone might be really
unmotivated to go to a job and sit in an
office but they might be really
motivated to go paint right well in that
case they should be a painter they
should be putting art up on the internet
trying to figure out how to build a
career out of that rather than wearing a
collar around their neck and going to a
dreary job and then high integrity is
the most important because otherwise
you've got the other two what you have
is you have a smart and hard-working
crook who's eventually gonna cheat you
so you have to figure out if the person
is high integrity and as we talked about
the way you do that is through signals
and signals is what they do not what
they say it's all the nonverbal stuff
that people do when they think nobody's
looking with respect to the energy there
was this interesting thing from Sam
Altman a while back where he was talking
about delegation and even saying one of
the important things for delegation is
delegate to people who are actually good
at the thing that you want to do it's
the most obvious thing but it seems like
you want to partner with people who are
naturally going to do the things that
you want them to do yeah I almost won't
start a company or hire a person or work
with somebody if I just don't think
they're into what I wanted to do when I
was younger I used to try and talk
people into things I was in this idea
you can sell someone into doing
something but you can't you can't keep
them motivated you can get them inspired
initially it might work if you're a king
like Henry the fifth and you trying to
get them to just charge in the battle
and then they'll figure it out but if
you're trying to keep someone motivated
for the long term that motivation has to
come intrinsically you can't just create
it nor can you be the crutch for them if
there
have that intrinsic motivation so you
have to make sure people actually are
high energy and want to do what you want
them to do and what you want to work
with them reading signals is very very
important signals are what people do
despite what they say so it's important
to pay attention to subtle signals we
all know that socially if someone treats
a waiter or waitress in a restaurant and
we badly then it's only a matter of time
until they treat you badly if somebody
screws over an enemy and is vindictive
towards them well it's only a matter of
time before they redefine you from
friend to enemy and you feel their wrath
so angry outraged vindictive short-term
thinking people are essentially that way
in many interactions in their life
people are oddly consistent it's one of
things you learn about them
so you want to find long-term people you
want to find people who seem
irrationally ethical for example I had
one friend of mine it was company I
invested in and the company failed and
he could have wiped out all the
investors but he kept putting more and
more personal money and through three
different pivots he put personal money
in until the company finally succeeded
and in the process he never what got the
investors and I was always grateful to
him for that I said like wow that's
amazing that you know you were so good
to your investors you didn't wipe them
out and he got offended by that he said
I didn't do it for you I didn't do it
for my investors I did it for me it's my
own self-esteem it's what I care about
that's how I live my life that's the
kind of person you want to work with
another quote that I like I retweet on
this I think I read this somewhere else
which me said I'm not taking credit for
this but I kind of modified a little bit
which is that self-esteem is a
reputation that you have with yourself
you will always know so good people
moral people ethical people easy to work
with people reliable people tend to have
very high self esteem because they have
very good reputation with themselves and
they understand that it's not ego self
esteem and ego are different things
because ego can be undeserving but self
esteem at least you feel like you lived
up to your own internal moral code of
ethics and so it's very hard to work
with people who end up being low
integrity then it's hard to figure out
who's high integrity and low integrity
generally the more someone is saying
that their moral and ethical and high
integrity the less likely they are to be
that way it's very much like status
signaling if you overtly bid for status
if you overly talk about
being high status that is a low status
move if you openly talk about how honest
and reliable and trustworthy you are
you're probably not that honest and
trustworthy that is a characteristic of
conmen so yeah picking an industry in
which you can play long-term games with
long-term people
