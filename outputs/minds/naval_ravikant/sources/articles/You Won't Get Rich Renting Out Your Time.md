next you go into more specific details
on how you can actually get rich and how
you can't get rich the first point was
about how you're not going to get rich
you're not going to get rich renting of
your time you must own equity a piece of
a business to gain your financial
freedom this is probably one of the
absolute most important points people
seem to think that you can create wealth
and make money through work and it's
probably not going to work there are
many reasons for that but the most basic
is just that your inputs are very
closely tied to your outputs in almost
any salary job even a one that's paying
a lot for our like a lawyer or a doctor
you're still putting in the hours and
every hour you get paid so what that
means is when you're sleeping you're not
burning when you're retired you're not
earning when you're in vacation you're
not earning and you can't earn
nonlinearly if you look at you in
doctors and get rich like really rich
it's because they open a business they
open like a private practice and that
private practice builds a brand and that
brand attracts people or they build some
kind of medical device or a procedure or
a process where they've intellectual
property so essentially you're working
for somebody else and that person is
taking on the risk and has the
accountability and the intellectual
property and the brand so they're just
not gonna pay you enough they're gonna
pay you the bare minimum that they have
to to get you to go to a job and that
can be a high bare minimum but it's
still not gonna be true wealth where
you're retired and then finally you're
actually just not even creating that
much original for society like I said
this tweets term should have been called
how to create wealth
it's just how to get rich with a more
catchy title but you're not creating new
things for society you're just doing
things over and over and you're
essentially replaceable because you're
now doing a set role most set roles can
be taught if they can be taught like in
a school then eventually you'll be
competing with someone who's got more
recent knowledge who's been taught and
is coming in to replace you you're much
more likely to be doing a job that can
be eventually replaced by a robot or by
an AI and it doesn't have to be a
wholesale replaced overnight they can
replace a little bit of a time and that
kind of eats into your wealth creation
and therefore you're earning capability
so fundamentally your inputs are matched
to your outputs you are replaceable and
you're not being clear
I just don't think that that is the way
that you can truly make money so
everybody who really makes money at some
point owns a piece of a product or a
business or some kind of IP that can be
through stock options so if you can be
working a tech company that's a fine way
to start but usually the real wealth is
created by starting your own companies
or by you know even investors there in
an investment firm and they're buying
equity so these are much more the routes
to wealth it doesn't come to the hours
you really just want a job or a career
or profession where your inputs don't
matter your outputs so if you look at
modern society are given too little in
the tweet storm businesses that have
high creativity and high leverage
tends to be ones where you could do an
hour of work and it can have a huge
effect or you can do a thousand hours of
working can have no effect for example
look at software engineering one great
engineer can for example create Bitcoin
and create billions of dollars with the
value an engineer who's working on the
wrong thing or not quite as good or just
not as creative or thoughtful or
whatever can work for an entire year and
every piece of code they ship ends up
not getting used customers don't want it
that is an example of a profession where
the input and the outputs are highly
disconnected it's not based on the
number of hours that you put in whereas
on the extreme other end if you're a
lumberjack even the best lumberjack in
the world assuming they're not working
with tools so the inputs and outputs
really connected I'm just using an ax or
a saw yeah the best lumberjack in the
world maybe like 3x better than one of
the worst Lumberjacks right it's not
going to be a gigantic difference so you
want to look for professions and careers
where the inputs and the outputs are
highly disconnected this is another way
of saying that you want to look for
things that are leveraged and by
leverage I don't mean financial leverage
alone like Wall Street uses and that has
a bad name I'm just talking about tools
we're using tools computer is a tool
that software engineers used if I'm a
lumberjack with bulldozers and automatic
robot axes and saws I'm gonna be using
tools and have more leverage than
someone who's just using his bare hand
and trying to rip the trees out by their
roots tools and leverage or what create
this disconnection between inputs and
outputs creativity so the higher the
creativity component of a profession the
more likely it is to have this connect
the inputs and outputs so I think that
if you're looking at professions where
you're inputting your outputs are highly
connected it's going to be very very
very hard to create wealth and make
wealth for yourself in that process
