I don't have heroes a hero's a big word
there are people that I look up to and
I've learned a lot from and Matt Ridley
has got to be near the top of that list
growing up I was a voracious reader
especially reading science Matt had a
bigger influence on pulling me into
science and a love of science than
almost any other author his first book
that I read was called genome
I must have six or seven dog-eared
copies of genome lying around in various
boxes it helped me define what life is
how it works why it's important and
placed evolution as a binding principle
in the center of my worldview that is a
common theme that runs across Matt's
books after that I read his book the Red
Queen which laid out the age-old
competition between bacteria viruses and
humans a topic that's extremely relevant
today I also read his book the rational
optimist would help me realize that it
was rational to be optimistic because of
the technological advancement the
scientific advancement that we've had as
human species since we first came across
fire the stone axe and basic tools his
book the origins of virtue helped me
take a game theoretical framework
towards the virtues and ethics his book
the evolution of everything have
continued that theme towards everything
evolving I'm sad to say I've missed one
or two of your books in there Matt at
the agile gene I have to go back and
read that one and most recently Matt
wrote a great book called how innovation
works which will be out by the time this
podcast is out there I had the pleasure
of reading an advance copy over the last
week welcome Matt honored to have you
here do you want to give us in your own
words a little bit of your background
and how you got into writing about
science Nivelle it's great to meet you
and really interesting to hear that
story of how you've read so many of my
books and got the point of them I'm
someone who's enjoyed writing all my
life I became a professional journalist
after a brief career as a scientist I
only got as far as doing a PhD in
biology and then decided that I wanted
to be a writer instead so I became a
journalist on the Economist magazine I
was science editor there for a number of
years and then a political reporter and
correspondent there as well and then
became a freelance writer that was when
I wrote the Red Queen after leaving The
Economist which was a book close to the
top
I'd been studying as a biologist that is
to say the evolution of sex from there
on I've been incredibly lucky because
people have given me contracts to write
books about things that interest me at
the moment it's about every five years
that I do a book but I don't do a book
until I'm interested enough in a topic
it's a very difficult decision plunging
into writing a book on one topic and
thereby not doing all the other topics
you want to write books about I had read
this book in preparation for this
conversation so it suffered from
becoming a chore because normally one
reads purely for enjoyment at their
leisure and this time it became more
about hitting a deadline that said this
has been your most impactful book for me
since genome it was very revealing there
are two things about this book that put
it in a different class than your
previous books for me one is that it
corrected a long-standing misconception
I have about how Silicon Valley works
I am steeped in Silicon Valley I've been
here since 1996 I'm investor in hundreds
of companies I've started close to a
dozen companies I thought I know this
game as well as anybody and your book
corrected a serious error that I had in
my mind of the framework of how Silicon
Valley works and we can get into that
the second thing about this book is that
it was actionable the first half was his
collection of incredible stories about
inventors and innovators that would be
fun historical reading in its own right
but then the second half was explaining
how innovation works and what helps it
work what stops it from working what
creates the conditions for it to work
and not work so I recommend this book
for two classes of people
one is innovators and would be
innovators themselves if you're an
entrepreneur in Silicon Valley Shanghai
or Bangalore and you're thinking about
creating products whether it's social
media launching rockets building
airplanes or genetic engineering you
need to read this book because it will
give you a better view of the history of
innovation as well as the future of
innovation than any other book that I
know of that context would be incredibly
important when you're trying to figure
out things like do I file patents how
important is a role of science how
important is a role of government how
long will it take for my innovation to
be adopted how much can I expect to sink
into legal battles were just explaining
things to be
versus building the product it's a
must-read for that category of people
the other category that it's very
relevant for is government officials
because to the extent that many of them
pay lip service to the idea of building
the next Silicon Valley or attracting
entrepreneurship they don't know how
people ask me this all the time and that
give them basic vague things that yeah
you need to have some freedom you need
to have nice weather or you need to have
university system but this book has an
actionable playbook near the end of how
to foster that environment I'm very
encouraged that you think it's practical
and actionable because that's one thing
I wanted to do in this book most of my
books are on the whole thinking about
the world rather than changing the world
but in this case I wanted to try and
zero in on the practicalities of what
innovation does involve there's one line
that I pulled out from near the end of
the book which is this idea you said
that innovation is the child of freedom
and the parent of prosperity and I love
that line that's a great tweet right
there child of freedom as to how do you
create innovation you have a very
expansive definition of freedom in there
and the parent of prosperity why it's
important we can give it to both those
but I thought that was a good summary I
don't know if you meant that to be the
summary you wanted but that is the one
that stuck out to me yes indeed your own
ideas are often triggered by other
people's ideas you need someone else to
tell you what you're saying almost this
freedom theme which ended up on the
cover of the book was pointed out to me
by the first reader of the book was a
very intelligent friend of mine called
John Constable who thinks about things
very deeply he came back in he said the
basic theme is freedom have you realized
that and I said I don't think I have
realized that now I then rewrote some
sections and probably that's where that
soundbite came from was one of the last
rewrites
now let's say another theme that is very
obvious and very profound is that
there's conversation that goes on over
and over about almost everything in
history which is is history the product
of a few great men and women a few great
accomplishments a few great moments a
few great battles a few great inventions
that happen to come along or is it an
inevitable inexorable and evolved
process you conclusively lay out lots of
evidence that innovation is an
evolutionary process rather than
invention process and actually you call
it innovation rather than invention that
seems a deliberate choice tell me about
that choice I try and draw a distinction
between invention and innovation it's
not a distinction that is cast in iron
but think this is the best way to think
about it invention is the coming out
with a prototype of a new device or a
new social practice innovation is the
business of turning a new device into
something practical affordable and
reliable that people want to use and
acquire it's the process of driving down
the prices process of driving up the
reliability and the efficiency of the
device and it's the process rating other
people to adopt it to its Thomas Edison
captures this point very well I don't
think he used the word innovation much
he used the word invention but he is
mainly an innovator because he's not
necessarily be coming up with original
ideas he's taking other people's ideas
and turning them into practical
propositions it was he who said that
this is a process of 1% inspiration and
99% perspiration
what I'm trying to do in this book is
rescue the perspiration obscurity and
slightly relegate the inspirator x' who
always think they deserve the most
credit and who sometimes complain about
not getting enough reward because it's
their original idea I like to tell the
story which Charles Townes used to tell
the inventor of the laser of a rabbit
and a beaver looking at the Hoover Dam
and the beaver is saying to the rabbit
no I didn't build it but it's based on
an idea of mine
that is how inventors quite often think
about innovation come on I had the idea
it's a huge amount of work and talent to
turn an idea into something practical
this is something that you learn in
Silicon Valley very early on that ideas
are a dime a dozen
every idea has been floating around even
a lot of the old ideas that failed were
initially bad ideas they were just the
wrong time in 1999 for example we had
the dot-com bubble we had things like
Webvan and Cosmo which crashed but now
we have instacart and postmates sindoor
- which actually work we had pets calm
that crash now we've had the big dog
food company bought by Amazon for over
half a billion dollars so these things
do work they just need that right
structure of previous innovations to
build on top of and sometimes you're
jumping too far ahead the previous
innovation stack the shoulders that you
want to stand on the giants don't yet
exist so you're trying to bootstrap too
much one of the things I'm doing in this
book is slightly downplaying the
importance of disruption most of the
time innovation is an incremental
process it looks disruptive when you're
looking backwards but at the time it's
surprisingly gradual the first version
of a new technology looks surprisingly
like the last version of an old
technology this is the misconception
about Silicon Valley that you fixed for
me which is I grew up reading science
and scientists and I originally wanted
to be a scientist but I was never very
good and knew I wasn't going to be a
world-class physicist and I wanted to
make money so I pivoted into technology
business which I thought was
commercializing science and bringing it
to the masses I came to Silicon Valley
thinking that invention was the thing
that I read about where a genius
inventor comes up with a new invention
and it changes the world Oliver in
Wilbur Wright created the airplane
Samuel Morse created the Telegraph
Alexander Graham Bell clear the
telephone or Newton and leave discovered
calculus without them we would have been
stuck in the dark ages for god knows how
long that was my view of how the world
worked when I came into Silicon Valley I
looked around and I didn't see that
happening I didn't see a single genius
inventor creating a single thing that
suddenly changed the world
I saw instead
people doing lots of tinkering somewhere
in the back of my head I adopted this
mentality even though I am in Silicon
Valley and even though it is the engine
of innovation for the world today or
seems likely we're not as innovative as
we used to be we've lost the great
people we've lost the audacious goals
and we don't invent new things the lone
inventor has gone away your book showed
me that that was a myth that lone
inventor never existed innovation is
going on all around us right now
especially in the unregulated domains
there's an old quip in Silicon Valley
that the reason we do was because we
operate in the last unregulated domains
but it didn't seem to me like there was
innovation going on but now that I
realize it's an evolutionary process
with lots of people looking at it from
the inside is a different view perhaps I
am in an innovative industry but I just
can't see it because I see the
evolutionary process internally as
opposed to the breakthrough process I'm
delighted to hear that that is what
you're experiencing because I very much
set out to make that point it's not a
case that there was a golden aged when
individuals invented things and nowadays
it's teams that do it it was always
teams in the sense of collaborators they
weren't necessarily working for the same
institution and a habit of giving the
nobel prize or the patent to one
individual has tended to pull out the
great man of history and put him on a
pedestal where he doesn't necessarily
deserve to be he's very important but
he's putting the last stone in the arch
and other people built the rest of the
arch in the book I described one of my
heroes and that's Norman Borlaug who
developed these short straw high
yielding varieties of wheat in Mexico
then persuaded India and Pakistan to
take them up and effectively kicked off
the Green Revolution which drove famine
largely extinct on the Indian
subcontinent and led to India becoming
an exporter of food rather than a
chronically starving country but where
did he get the idea of these dwarf
varieties of wheat which could handle
higher applications of fertilizer and
therefore produce greater yields he got
it in a bar in Buenos Aires at a
conference from Burton bales
but bales is a fan
obscure agronomist who happened to be at
this conference but he had seen Orville
Vogel growing this stuff in Oregon and
crossing different varieties Orville
Vogel had got these varieties from a guy
called Cecil salmon who'd been on
Douglas MacArthur's staff in Tokyo at
the end of the war and had visited our
cultural stations in Japan and found
these dwarf varieties growing and they
had been developed crossed hybridized
and bred by GaN zero inuzuka
and he had got them from somewhere in
the Korean Peninsula and this point the
trail goes cold and few then jump back
to Norman Borlaug and say yes but he
didn't persuade India single-handedly he
talked to MS Swaminathan
Indian geneticist who picked the ball up
and did a huge amount of work to
persuade his countrymen to take up this
technology so there's a nice example of
what looks like there's a linear chain
of people but in a sense it's also a
team collaborative enterprise and a much
more gradual story than it would be in
the normal way of telling it this also
helps explain why it tends to be
geographically concentrated if it was a
breakthrough by lone individuals you'd
expect innovation to be highly
geographically distributed but it tends
to be very geographically concentrated
where you're surrounded by other
inventors tinkerers and thinkers because
you're always building on little bits
and pieces we see that in Silicon Valley
where it's geographically dense and
concentrated almost to a level that
seems unfair to the rest of the world
one person's idea at a cocktail party
goes the next person at a coffee shop
goes into a prototype we're supposed to
a VC who talks about it within the
portfolio company who then mentions it
another entrepreneur and so on I'm
amazed by how geographically
concentrated innovation is at any one
point in history in the last 50 years
it's been California but there was a
period when it was Victorian Britain
there was a period when it was the Low
Countries there was a period when it was
Renaissance Italy at some point it was
ancient Greece it was Fujian China for a
while it was probably the angie's Valley
at a different point why is the bushfire
only burning in one place at one time
the key to this is understanding the
ecosystem in which these innovative
people operate because they're not only
getting ideas from each other and
daring each other on to be innovators
and experiencing some unique aspects of
freedom to allow them to do it but
they're also directly borrowing
technologies it became clear to me when
I was writing about the harbour process
which fixes nitrogen from the air very
important process for good and evil in
terms of making explosives but also in
terms of making fertilizer that it
couldn't have happened without all the
other industries around it in Germany
that were producing the high-quality
metals and chemicals that were necessary
for this process the same will be true
in Silicon Valley one idea won't work
without the neighboring company
producing devices and programs that are
necessary in developing your idea now
it's gotten to another level where when
you first create an innovation when you
launch a new product you need customers
the early adopter customers tend to be
other innovative companies when Silicon
Valley we have a critical mass of
thousands of innovative companies that
will adopt products from each other so
you not only find your innovator base
and your talent base in one place but
you also find your customer base in one
place that network effect ends up being
very tight and of course the local
politicians exploit it with high taxes
and low services constantly attacking
and blaming technology for all evils but
it works for them because this has
turned into the Golden Goose it's the
oil reservoir that will always be
gushing so they can get away with a lot
until it no longer is gushing one of the
patterns of innovators is that they move
they move from uncongenial regimes to
congenial ones the secret of Europe when
it was at its most innovative was that
it was fragmented politically it's very
hard to unify Europe because of all the
mountain ranges and peninsulas so you
end up with lots of different countries
a lot of the innovative people like
Gutenberg the pioneer of printing had to
move from his home town to another town
to find a regime that would allow him
the same is true I reckon of China in
the Song Dynasty which is the period
when it was most innovative it was a
surprisingly decentralized Empire at the
time and it was possible for people to
move around and escape from local brew
wasn't promising America is the
exception that seems to prove this rule
because although it looks like an empire
from the outside a great big unified
country once you get inside it you find
that California has quite different
regime from other parts even this week
Elon Musk was talking about leaving
California because he's so upset with
the way they're treating the end of
lockdown and moving to Texas like a 15th
century European innovator threatening
to leave one part of Germany for another
part of Germany for a long time I had
thought despite the poor political
governance California was impregnable it
had too much of a network effect the
lock was too strong but now I can see
the cracks this pandemic of course is
accelerating things forcing people to
work remotely Twitter recently announced
they're gonna go to fully remote many of
the companies that have been involved
with are wondering should we even go
back to having an office I wouldn't be
surprised if the next Silicon Valley
moves to the cloud that would be an
incredibly good thing for all of
humanity because then we could
distribute it obviously some things
can't move to the cloud you can't have
manufacturing plant in the cloud but the
initial coordination invention social
networking conversation design work a
lot of that can happen the cloud there
is recent precedents for this I don't
know how much you've been tracking the
crypto revolution but crypto obviously
went through it's big hype cycle a few
years ago at this point there's a lot of
innovation going on in crypto we're now
sort of in that silence under the radar
phase where great entrepreneurs are
actually building great products that
will be more widely deployed in the next
five to ten years what's interesting
about crypto is it is truly
geographically distributed some of the
biggest innovators in crypto are
scattered all around the world more than
half of my crypto investments are
outside of the Bay Area which is not
true of any other class of investment
that I do many of the top crypto
innovators are anonymous
like Satoshi Nakamoto most famously
crypto companies raise money in public
in plain sight by issuing tokens they're
not locked into the Sandhill Road
venture capital model the crypto system
is starting with finance but is laying
the foundation for future companies to
be built completely distributed with
potentially anonymous contributors
anonymous funding anonyme
kache anonymous developers there's even
a holy grail in crypto called a
distributed autonomous organization
which are these companies there are
smart contracts living in the blockchain
completely extra sovereign outside of
the state able to engage in contract
laws contract enforcement payments
dividends investment equity debt payouts
reputations and reconstructing the
corporation but modernizing it from the
Magna Carta days you know back in the
1600s to a modern codebase living on the
blockchain mathematical reputation based
anonymous system it wouldn't be
surprised if ten years from now that the
rest of the tech industry is just as
distributors of crypto industries today
California the Bary will still do fine
they will still be a hub I don't believe
that innovators have yet priced out of
the Bay Area just because innovators are
the highest earners in history they're
the most leveraged people they leverage
to code capital media labor intelligence
they can create more than everybody else
on a per capita basis so they can always
afford to live wherever they want to
live they won't be forced out by prices
but they may be forced out by
regulations they may be forced out by
its not being able to go to work because
the government forbids them they may be
forced out because the place is no
longer attractive to live if they are
forced out it would be amazing for
everybody if they move to the cloud
rather than to another physical location
from where we may be displaced in the
examples that you gave there punctuated
in between each one of them there's
fifty hundred two hundred years that
passes where there is no place to
innovate therefore the rate of
innovation collapses
so if innovation is the flower of a
well-tended garden if you have to uproot
those flowers and shift them there is a
huge deadweight loss to all society when
for decades or perhaps even centuries we
have to wait for another garden to
emerge and for people to coalesce there
for this right magic soup of regulation
combined with innovators combined with
good weather and combined with rich
society all of that has to assemble
thank you very much for that because
that is filled in a gap in my
understanding in one go I've always been
interested in the fact that these
innovation bushfires eventually are
extinguished usually by some combination
of Chiefs priests and thieves if you
like I like that Chiefs priests and
thieves or as a wag might say Chiefs
priests and thieves what's the
difference
exactly so in Ming China it's a very
restrictive authoritarian and
interfering political regime that kills
the ghosts that's laying the golden eggs
in Abbasid Arabia not hugely different
in the time period we're talking about
eleven hundreds a great flowering of
knowledge and innovation is crushed by
the religious fundamentalist revival
when Islam goes from being a very
open-minded to a very closed-minded
structure the something similar is
happening in Paris around the same time
bernard of clairvaux burning books as a
period when it's possible the world
could have lost this habit altogether it
could have given up on innovation
everywhere the flame would been
extinguished
fortunately the Italian city-states kept
the flame burning and I write about
Fibonacci the Italian merchant who
brings Indian numerals from North Africa
back to Italy and they spread around the
world it's lucky that somewhere keeps
the show on the road
at each stage in history but it's not
accidental these are people escaping the
other regime and starting it again but I
did worry that in the old days there was
always somewhere else to go in this
global world you could imagine a
sufficiently by knighted cult taking
over the entire world and saying no we
don't want learning innovation and
technology we want to stop everything
it's very unlikely but what if America
really does lose its mojo and we have to
rely on China for the world's innovation
engine China is not a free place it's a
politically tutorial' regime albeit
there's a certain amount of freedom for
entrepreneurs below the level of
politics
if that's our only hope it's not a great
prospect maybe India can pick up the
baton Europe's not great at picking up
the baton at the moment it's not a very
innovative continent it's trying to
centralize all its decision-making
through the European Union but India has
done this before it was probably the
first place to start all this going and
is a place of free thought and a lot of
spontaneous order a lot of spontaneous
disorder - maybe that's the place but
you've given me another prospect which
is that actually this can escape the
Chiefs priests and thieves into the
cloud where it can be out of their reach
for at least long enough until they work
out how to reach it I think the digital
innovation can escape into the cloud
obviously physical innovation requires
physical infrastructure and for that
would have depend on enlightened
city-state a Switzerland type place or a
Singapore or in New Zealand but then you
have a small market problem you don't
have many early adopters of the
technology so although you can build a
prototype you can't deploy it in volume
I do think physical innovation is in
trouble and you talk about this in the
book the speed of innovation has been
very low in places like for example
speed we can't travel any faster than we
used to and why is that
so mostly regulatory reasons and it's
because one underlying theme running
this whole book is the innovation is a
process of evolution like any process of
evolution
it requires trial and error innovation
happens by taking the body of innovators
that surround you one step further
engaging in lots of trial and having
error and feedback from customers in the
economy all of those pieces are
necessary you need to have a body of
innovators around you which means that
you there has to be a place where they
can all gather whether it's online or
offline there has to be the ability to
take lots of tries you need venture
capital you need startups you need a
friendly environment to start a business
and then error we don't like people
making error anymore
so we try to cover the downside risk but
by doing that we also cut off the upside
and then finally you need that feedback
loop from the environment and part of
that involves a large customer base so
I'm optimistic that we can do this in
the digital domain and I can see that
happening in crypto for example but I'm
a little
pessimistic in the physical domain which
is unfortunate because a lot of the big
problems of humanity that we have to
solve like the energy problem getting
nuclear fusion working at large scale or
the transportation problem moving people
around quickly with hypersonic Jets or
even some of the biotech problems these
require physical infrastructure large
markets and relatively deregulate
environments so I think you're right
we're down to India and China and
neither of those is ideal China is not
going to be a place where the next Jew
fleeing the Nazis is gonna go to because
China is not an integration destination
it doesn't attract the best and
brightest California doesn't create
entrepreneurs California attracts
entrepreneurs China is not going to be
an attractor because of that it will
always be very limited India even though
it has a lot of the other elements
doesn't have the basic infrastructure
that make an attractive place to go to
and because of its poverty level does
have a very anti innovation culture
innovators in India often survive by
keeping their heads down you can see
this in how India banned crypto
hopefully that'll get overturned but
they can do things like that
early on something got listed on eBay
India that wasn't supposed to be listed
so this is rounded up the local eBay
managers and threw them in jail the
history of India fostering innovation
recently has not been great that said
there is a flowering going on right now
in places like Bangalore and Mumbai and
Delhi hopefully as India gets richer and
is run by more competent government
we're gonna see them step out of the way
and allow India to become an innovation
hub the market there is large enough
they're poor enough that they could
welcome it they're english-speaking
they're very well-educated there's a
deep respect for stem so India could be
one of these hubs but they would also
have to then have immigration and places
that are clean and beautiful and nice
where people want to live because
innovators are going to go live where
they want to live because they're so
productive you also said something else
very interesting what about people who
may create a global movement to stop
innovation that is very scary and very
possible if you look at environmentalism
environmentalism runs in two tracks
today there's the local environmentalism
which everybody can get behind clean up
by rivers save the species
I want trees forests and parks and
everybody likes that
then it gets mixed into this global
command-and-control environmentalism
which says you must stop progress you
must stop innovation you must stop
everything because you're destroying the
environment one of the things that you
talk about in your book is how the world
is reforesting how innovation allows us
to do more with less and how we've
become much more efficient as a society
we're not gonna be able to stop Indian
China from growing we're not going to
stop them from innovating we're not
gonna stop them from modernizing we can
do what Elon Musk does he says let me
give them solar power in electric cars
and rockets as quickly as possible so
they can jump through the wasteful phase
of innovation where there's a lot of
environmental destruction and get to the
part where we can all afford clean
rivers and beautiful forests nice parks
and other species in our environment by
the ways I credit this to genome the
book paints a picture of utopia not in
the sense of a top-down human enforced
platonic sense that this is how the
world should be run but in how the
natural world is designed and operates
and our role in it as an intelligent
cooperative eight to fit into that
environment genome paints a picture of
paradise being a garden every human
knows that and it's even in our deeply
embedded myths and Adam and Eve paradise
as a garden they fall from grace they
fall out of the garden where do you want
to be living in your little apartment in
New York City or a little flat in London
or do you wanna be sitting in a
beautiful garden out in the sunshine
humans inherently want a clean and
beautiful environment but that movement
gets hacked by top-down command and
control mechanisms by Chiefs priests and
thieves who can then squander our
existing resources as well as squash
innovation which prevents us from moving
forward
