even though you can certainly achieve
happiness and mental health without
financial health the truth is in modern
society most of us understand the
financial wealth can give us freedom it
can give us time it can give us peace
you're not gonna buy your way to
happiness but you will buy your way out
of common causes of unhappiness in olden
times one of the routes to finding peace
was you would become a monk you would
renounce things you would renounce sex
you'd renounce money you would renounce
shelter you would renounce attachments
and you would go off in the woods and
after 30 years and you'd finally gotten
over the fact you weren't gonna have
these things then you might find some
peace when the truth is most of them
probably never got over it
lots of monks out there not a lot of
enlightened people I think was Osho he
said every time I meet a prostitute she
wants to talk about God and every time I
meet a priest he wants to talk about sex
whatever it is that you deny yourself
will become your new prison if you have
a desire for material comfort it's
actually gonna be easier and faster to
fulfill it in modern society if you know
what you're doing and are capable and
then it will be for you to renounce it
it'll take a lifetime to renounce it and
maybe then it won't work
but you can make some money and be
materially successful in less than a
lifetime you can get there without it
and probably have a more lasting form
without it but that's playing on
hardmode physical health of course is
the foundation of everything if you
don't have your physical health you have
nothing
another great Confucius saying that I
liked was that a sick man only wants one
thing a healthy man wants 10,000 things
when you're sick when you're down all
your other desires run away without the
ability to get up and function you can't
turn into this desiring machine that you
are physical health is actually the most
important but I speak the least on the
topic because I have the least specific
and unique knowledge I'm not self
actualized in that regard I'm in okay
Hill okay shape and I have an OK diet I
understand a lot of the theory of it but
I would feel fraudulent giving you that
theory unless I've were a paragon of
excellence in that domain where's I
think in wealth
I'm much more self actualized and on the
peace side I've gone from being a mostly
unhappy person to being a very happy
person and that I think was deliberate
it was practiced it was F
based it was through realizations and
made progress so I have a chance to tell
you what worked for me
