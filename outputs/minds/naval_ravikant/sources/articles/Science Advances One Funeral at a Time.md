i had a bunch of the sides that i wanted
to dive into like finding path
integrals because it seems to me that
there's some kind of a deep symmetry
between multiverse theory and feminine
path integrals
you're absolutely right he believed in
multiple histories but to the extent
that he thought that these were
actually physically real things or
merely
mathematical objects is open to question
he was relatively silent on the matter
he was certainly a realist but he made
one of the worst quips and's an absolute
genius probably
next to einstein the second greatest
physicists of the 20th century but he
said
if you think you understand quantum
theory you don't understand quantum
theory
which is nonsense whoever it understood
quantum theory david deutsch understands
quantum theory so
that was one of the few occasions where
feynman fell into irrationality and
pessimism
i think was a plank who said science
advances one funeral at a time
[Laughter]
unfortunately even the best gets stuck
behind i see this in my own field where
you have some of the greatest investors
of our time like warren buffett and
charlie munger who are just absolute
geniuses
but they cannot wrap their minds around
cryptocurrencies the idea that there's
going to be an extra sovereign money
that is native to the internet is
programmable as foreign to them because
of their money is always something that
has been provided by the government and
controlled by the government
and they just cannot imagine it any
other way so it's just the nature of
people
