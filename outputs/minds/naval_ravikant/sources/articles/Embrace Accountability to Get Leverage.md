so why don't we jump into accountability
which I thought was pretty interesting
and I think you have your own unique
take on it
so the first tweet on accountability was
embrace accountability and take business
risks under your own name Society will
reward you with responsibility equity
and leverage yeah so to get rich you
know you're gonna need leverage and
leverage comes in labor it comes in
capital or it can come through code or
media but most of these like labor and
capital people have to give to you for
labor somebody has to follow you for
capital somebody's to give you money or
assets to manage or machines so to get
these things you to build up credibility
and you have to do those under your own
name as much as possible which is risky
so accountability is a double-edged
thing it allows you to take credit when
things go well and to bear the brunt of
the failure when things go badly so in
that sense you know people who are
stamping their names on things aren't
foolish they're just confident maybe
turns out to be foolish in the end but
if you look at a Kanye or an Oprah or a
Trump or an Elon or anyone like that
these people can get rich just off their
name because their name is such powerful
branding you know regardless so what you
think of Trump you have to realize that
the guy was among the best in the world
at just branding his name why would you
go to Trump casino used to because Trump
why would you go to Trump Tower because
of Trump when it came time to vote
I think that a lot of voters just went
and said Trump they recognize the name
so the name recognition paid off same
thing with Oprah she puts her brand on
something her name on something and it
flies off the shelves and it's like
instant validator but these people also
take risks for putting their name out
there obviously Trump is now probably
hated by half or more than half of the
country and by a big chunk of the world
but he sticks his name out there by
putting your name out there you become a
celebrity and fame has many many
downsides it's better to be anonymous
and rich than to be poor and famous but
even famous and rich has a lot of
downsides associated with it you're
always in the public eye so
accountability is quite important when
you're working to build a product or
you're working on a team or you're
working in a business we are constantly
drummed into our heads how important it
is to be part of a team and absolutely
agree with that a lot of our training
socially is telling us to not stick our
necks
the crowd this is saying that I hear
from Australian friends at the tall
poppy gets cut right don't stick your
neck out but I would say that actually a
really really well functioning team is
small and has clear accountability for
each two different portions like so you
can say okay this person is responsible
for building the product this person is
responsible for the messaging this
person is responsible for raising money
this person responsible for the pricing
strategy and then maybe their online
advertising so if somebody screws up you
know exactly who's responsible what at
the same time something goes really well
you also know exactly who's responsible
so if you have a small team and you have
clearly delineated responsibilities then
you can still keep a very high level of
accountability and accountability is
really important because when something
succeeds or fails if it fails everybody
points fingers at each other and if it
succeeds everybody steps forward to take
credit and we've all had that experience
when we were in school and we got like a
group assignment to do and there were
people in there there were probably a
few people in there who did a lot of the
work and then there are a few people who
just did a lot of grandstanding or
positioning to do the work so we're all
familiar with this from a childhood
sense but it is sort of uncomfortable to
talk about but clear accountability is
important without accountability you
don't have incentives without
accountability you can't build
credibility but you take risk so you
take risk of failure you take risk of
humiliation you take risk of failure
under your own name which you know
luckily in modern society there's no
more debtors prison and people don't go
to jail or get executed for losing other
people's money but we're still socially
hardwired to not fail in public under
our own names and the people who have
the ability to fail in public under
their own names actually gain a lot of
power for example I'll give a personal
anecdote up until about 2013 2014 my
public persona was entirely around
startups and investing and only around
2014-2015 did I start talking about
philosophy and psychological things and
kind of broader things and it made me a
little nervous because I was doing it
under my own name and there were
definitely people in the industry who
sent me messages kind through the back
channel like what are you doing your
ending your career this is stupid and I
kind of just went with it I took a risk
same with crypto early on to the risk
but when you put your name out there you
take a risk with certain things you also
get to reap
reward you get the benefits
