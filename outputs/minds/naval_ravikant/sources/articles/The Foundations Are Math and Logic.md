and to me foundational things are
principles there are algorithms they're
deep-seated logical understanding where
you can defend it or attack it from any
angle and that's why microeconomics is
important because macroeconomics a lot
of memorization a lot of macro
as Nassim Taleb says it is easier to
macro than it is to micro
 because macroeconomics is
voodoo complex science meets politics
you can't find two macro economists to
agree on anything these days and
different macro economists get used by
different politicians to peddle their
different pet theories there are even
macro economists out there now peddling
something called modern monetary theory
which basically says hey except for this
pesky thing called inflation we can just
print all the money that we want yes
except for this pesky thing called
inflation
that's like saying instead of limited
energy we can fire rockets off into
space all day long it's just nonsense
but the fact that there are people who
have macroeconomists in their title and
are peddling modern monetary theory just
tells you that macroeconomics as a
so-called science has been corrupted
it's a blanch of politics so you really
want to focus on the foundations
foundation the ultimate foundation are
mathematics and logic if you understand
logic and mathematics then you have the
basis for understanding scientific
method once you understand the
scientific method then you can
understand how to separate truth from
falsehood in other fields and other
things that you're reading so be very
careful about reading other people's
opinions and even be careful about
reading facts because so-called facts
are often just opinions but you know
with a veneer around them what you
really are looking for is algorithms but
you're really looking for his
understanding it's better to go through
a book really slowly and struggle and
stumble and rewind then it is to fly
through it quickly and say well now I
read 20 books ever at 30 books I've read
50 books in the field
it's like Bruce Lee said I don't fear
the man who knows a thousand kicks in a
thousand punches
I fear the man who's practiced one punch
ten thousand times or one kick 10,000
times it's the understanding that comes
through repetition and three usage and
through logic and foundations that
really makes you a smart thinker to lay
a foundation for
for the rest of your life I think you
need two things if I was gonna try and
sum it up one practical persuasion and
two you need to go deep in some
technical category whether it's abstract
math or you want to read Donald Knuth
books on algorithms or you want to read
fineman's lectures on physics if you
have practical persuasion and a deep
understanding of some complex topic I
think you'll have a great foundation for
learning for the rest of your life yeah
if I can expand it a little bit I would
say that the five most important skills
are of course reading writing arithmetic
and then as you are adding in persuasion
which is talking and then finally I
would add computer programming just
because it's an applied form of
arithmetic that just gets you so much
leverage for free in any domain that you
operate in if you're good with computers
if you're good at basic mathematics if
you're good at writing if you're good at
speaking and if you like reading you're
set for life
