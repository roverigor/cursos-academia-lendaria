one more question about leverage do you
think a choice of business model or a
choice of product can also bring a kind
of leverage to it
for example pursuing a business that has
Network effects pursuing a business that
has brand effects or other choices of
business model that people could
manipulate that just give you free
leverage yeah there's some really good
micro economic concepts that are
important to understand one of those are
scale economies which is the more you
produce is something the cheaper it gets
to make but that's something that a lot
of businesses have basic economics 101
and you should try and get into a
business we're making widget number 12
is cheaper than making widget number 5
and making widget number 10,000 is a lot
cheaper than the previous ones and this
builds up an automatic sort of barrier
to entry against competition and getting
commoditized so that's an important one
another one this is along the same lines
but technology products especially and
media products have this great quality
where they have zero marginal cost of
reproduction so creating another copy
what you just created is free so when
somebody listens this podcast or watches
a YouTube video about this it doesn't
cost me anything but the next person who
shows up those zero marginal cost things
they take a while to get going because
you make very little money per user but
over time they can really really add up
so Joe Rogan is working no harder on his
current podcast and he wasn't podcast
number one but on podcast number 1100
he's making a million dollars for the
podcast where's for the previous one he
probably lost money for the first one
that's an example of zero marginal cost
and then the most subtle but the most
important is this idea of network
effects and it comes from computer
networking Bob Metcalfe who created
Ethernet famously coined Metcalfe's law
which is the value of a network is
proportional to the square of the number
of nodes in the network so if network of
size 10 would have a value of a hundred
Network of a size 100 would have a value
of 10,000 it's not just 10x more it's a
hundred X more because the square so the
difference is in the square so you want
to be in a network effects business
assuming you're not number two if you're
number one in network effect business
you win everything so example if you
look at Facebook right your friends and
family social networking protocol who
their competitor nobody because they
want everything through network effects
which is why when people say well I can
just switch away from Facebook they
don't realize that network effects
create natural monopolies they're very
very powerful things and one of the
dirty secrets of Silicon Valley is that
a lot of the winning businesses are
natural monopolies even dried sharing
tends towards one winner-take-all system
like uber will always have better
economics than lift as long as it's
moving more drivers and more riders
around something like Google there's
basically only one viable search engine
I do like DuckDuckGo you know privacy
reasons but they're just always gonna be
behind because of network effects
Twitter right where else would you go
for micro blogging even YouTube has a
weak network effects but they're still
powerful enough there's really no
number-two site that you go to to
consume your video in a regular basis it
even turns out in detail Amazon Prime
and convenience store credit cards and
information creates a powerful network
effect so what is the network effect
let's just define it precisely a network
effect is when each additional user adds
value to the existing user base so your
users themselves are creating some value
for the existing users the classic
example that I think everybody can
understand is language let's say that
there's a hundred people live in the
community and speak ten different
languages and each person just speaks
one of those ten well you're having to
translate all the time it's incredibly
painful but if all hundred of you spoke
the same language it would add
tremendous value and so the way that
community will play out is ten people
start out speaking ten languages so
let's say that one extra person lives
English well now all of a sudden eleven
people know English so the next person
comes in to learn a new language
probably gonna choose English at some
point let's say English gets to twenty
or twenty-five people it's done it's
just gonna own the entire language
marketplace and the rest of the
languages will get competed out which is
why long term the entire world is
probably gonna end up speaking English
in Chinese China is closed off on the
internet but the Internet itself is a
great leveler and people who want to
communicate on the Internet are forced
to speak English because the largest
community of people on the Internet
speaks English I always feel bad for my
colleagues who grew up speaking foreign
languages in foreign countries because
you don't have access to so many books
so many books just haven't been
translated into other languages
if you only spoke French or you only
spoke German or you only spoke Hindi for
example you would be at a severe
disadvantage in a technical education
invariably if you go and get a technical
education you have to learn English just
because you have to read these books
that have this data that has not been
translated so languages are probably the
oldest example of network effect money
is another example we should all
probably be using the same money except
for the fact that Geographic and
regulatory boundaries have created these
artificial islands of money but even
then the world tends to use a single
currency as the reserve currency at most
times currently the US dollar so network
affects a very powerful concept when
you're picking a business model it's
really good idea
to pick a model where you can benefit
from network effects low marginal costs
and scale economies and these tend to go
together like anything that has zero
marginal cost of production obviously
has scale economies and things that have
zero marginal costs of reproductions
very often tend to have Network effects
because it doesn't cost you anything
more to stamp out the thing so then you
can just create little hooks for users
to add value to each other we should
always be thinking about how your users
your customers can add value to each
other because that is the ultimate form
of leverage you're in the beach of the
Bahamas or you're sleeping at night and
your customers are adding value to each
other
