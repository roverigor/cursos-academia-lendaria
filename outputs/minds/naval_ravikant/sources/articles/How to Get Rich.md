hey this is nivi you're listening to the
navall podcast this is one giant mega
sowed that collects every episode we've
done on getting rich all of it based on
his tweet storm of how to get rich
without getting lucky I've collected
them all here because we're going to
switch topics to the new topic of
happiness on the next episode we've
published one of these giant mega subs
before but this one's even bigger it's
about three and a half hours long it
covers all the tweets from the how to
get rich tweet storm plus all the Q&A
that we did after that plus ten minutes
of bonus material at the very end that
we've never released the overall sound
quality of this mega sowed improves a
lot after the first hour you can find a
link to a clean transcript in the show
notes or if you go to the website nav al
there's no calm at the end I hope you
enjoy you probably know Nepal from his
Twitter account and we're gonna be
talking about his epic tweet storm on
how to get rich without getting lucky
we're going to go through most of the
tweets in detail giving the ball a
chance to expand on them and just
generally riff on the topic he'll
probably throw in some ideas that he
hasn't even published before he's also
the co-founder of angel lists and
opinions he's a prolific tech investor
in companies like Twitter uber and many
more and I'm the co-founder evangelist
navall and I also co-authored the
venture hacks blog with him back in the
day yeah me how to get Mitch tweet storm
definitely hit a nerve a lot of people
say it was helpful reach across aisles
and people outside of tech industry
people in all walks of life people do
want to know how to solve their money
problems and everyone vaguely knows that
they want to be wealthy but they don't
have a good set of principles to do it
by what's the difference between wealth
money and status wealth is the thing
that you really want wealth is assets
that earn while you sleep wealth is the
factory that with the robots as cranking
out things wealth is the computer
program that's running at night that's
serving other customers wealth is even
money in the bank that is being
reinvested into other ass
and into other businesses even a house
can be a form of wealth because you can
rent it out although it's probably a
lower use of productivity but land and
actually doing some commercial
enterprise so my definition of wealth is
much more businesses and assets that can
earn while you sleep but really the
reason you want wealth is because it
buys you freedom so you don't have to
wear a tire like a collar around your
neck
so you don't have to wake up at 7 a.m.
and rush to work and sit and commute
traffic so you don't have to waste away
your entire life grinding all the
productive hours into a way into a
soulless job that doesn't fulfill you so
the purpose of wealth is freedom it's
nothing more than that
it's like to buy fur coats or drive
Ferraris or sail yachts or jet around
the world in your Gulfstream that stuff
gets really boring and really stupid
really fast
it's really just so that you are your
own sovereign individual you're not
gonna get that unless you really want it
and the entire world wants it and the
entire world is working hard at it and
to some extent it is competitive it's a
positive sum game but there are
competitive elements to it because
there's a finite amount of resources
right now in society and to get the
resources to do what you want you have
to stand out money is how we transfer
wealth money is social credits it is the
ability to have credits and debits on
other people's time if I do my job right
if I create value for society Society
says oh thank you we owe you something
in the future for the work that you did
in the past here's a little IOU let's
call that money and that money gets the
base because people steal the IOUs the
government prints extra io u--'s people
Rometsch under io u--'s but really what
money is trying to be it is trying to be
a reliable Iowa you from society that
you are owed something for something you
or someone who gave you that money did
in the past and we can transfer these
IOUs around so really money is how we
transfer well there are fundamentally
two huge games in life that people play
one is the money game because money's
not gonna solve all your problems but
it's gonna solve all your money problems
so I think that people know that they
realize that so they want to make money
but at the same time many of them deep
down believe that they can't make it
they don't want any wealth creation to
happen so this virtue signal by
attacking the whole enterprise by saying
well making money is evil
do it bottle blah but what they're
trying to do is they're actually playing
the other game to the status game
they're trying to be high status in the
eyes of other people watching by saying
oh I don't need money we don't want
money and then status is just your
ranking in the social hierarchy so
wealth is not a zero-sum game everybody
in the world can have a house because
you have a house doesn't take away from
my ability to have a house if anything
the more houses that are built the
easier it becomes to build houses the
more we know about building houses and
just the more people that can have
houses so wealth is a very positive sum
game we create things together we're
starting this endeavor to create this
hopefully piece of art that explains
what we're doing at the end of it
something brand-new will be create it's
a positive sub-game status on the other
hand is a zero-sum game
it's a very old game we've been playing
it since monkey tribes and it's
hierarchical who's number one who's
number two who's number three and for a
number three to move to number two
number two has to move out of that slot
so status is zero-sum game politics is
an example of a status game even sports
is an example of a status game to be the
winner there must be a loser
I don't fundamentally love status games
they play an important role in our
society so we figure out who's in charge
but fundamentally you play them because
they're necessary evil the problem is an
evolutionary basis like if you go back
thousands of years status is a much
better predictor of survival than wealth
as you couldn't have wealth before the
farming age before farmers because you
couldn't store things hunter-gatherers
carried everything on their backs so
hunter-gatherers lived entirely in
status based societies farmers started
going to wealth based societies and the
modern industrial economies are much
more heavily wealth based societies but
there's always a subtle competition
going on between status and wealth for
example when journalists attack rich
people or they attack the technology
industry they're really bidding for
status they're saying no the people are
more important and I the journalist
represents the people and therefore I am
more important the problem is that by
playing these status games to win at a
status game you have to put somebody
else down that's why you should avoid
status games in your life because they
make you into an angry combative person
you're always fighting to put other
people down to put yourself and the
people that you like up and they're
always going to exist
no way around it but just realize that
most of the times when you're trying to
create wealth you're actually getting
attacked by someone else and they're
trying to look like a goody two-shoes
but really what they're doing is they're
trying to up their own status at your
expense they're just playing a different
game and it's a worse game it's a
zero-sum game instead of a positive sum
game
one thing you mentioned before the
interview that stuck with me was the
idea that you think everyone can become
rich and that perhaps some of the ways
of getting rich or the idea of wealth is
vilified by some people in other
countries say you want to expand on that
a little bit yeah I think there's this
notion that making money is evil right
it's like rooted all the way back down
to money's the root of all evil people
think that bankers steal our money and
you know it's somewhat true in that in a
lot of the world there's a lot of theft
going on all the time the history of the
world in some sense is this
predator-prey relationship between
makers and takers there are people who
go out and create things and build
things and work hard on things and then
they're people who come along and play
with a sword or a gun or taxes or crony
capitalism or communism or what-have-you
there's all these different methods to
steal even in nature there are more
parasites than there are non parasitical
organisms you have ton of parasites in
you who are living off of you and the
better ones are symbiotic they're giving
something back but there are a lot that
are just taking that's just the nature
of how any complex system is built but
what I am focused on is true wealth
creation it's not about taking money
it's not about taking something from
somebody else but it's when creating
abundance obviously there's not a finite
number of jobs or a finite amount of
wealth otherwise we will still be
sitting around in caves figuring out how
to divide a pieces of firewood and you
know the occasional dead deer so most of
the wealth and civilization in fact not
most all of it has been created and it
got created from somewhere it got
created from people they got created
from technology a critical productivity
got created from hard work so this idea
that if stolen is I think this horrible
zero-sum game that people who are trying
to gain status play but the reality is
everyone can be rich and we can see that
by seeing that in the first world
everyone is richer than almost anyone
who was alive too
hundred years ago 200 years ago nobody
had any biotics nobody had cars nobody
had electricity nobody had the iPhone so
all of these things are inventions that
have made us wealthier as a species
today I would rather be a poor person in
the first world country than be a rich
person in Louisa 14th France I'd rather
be a poor person today than an
aristocrat back then and that's just
because of wealth creation the engine of
technologies science that is applied for
the purpose of creating abundance so I
think fundamentally everybody can be
wealthy and the thought experiment I
want you to think through is imagine if
everybody had the knowledge of a good
software engineer and a good hardware
engineer if you could go out there and
you could build robots and computers and
bridges and program them let's say every
human knew how to do that what do you
think society would look like in 20
years my guess is what would happen is
we would build robots machines software
and hardware to do everything and we
would all be living in massive abundance
we would essentially be retired in the
sense that none of us would have to work
for any of the basics we'd even have
robotic nurses we have like machine
driven hospitals we have self-driving
cars we'd have farms that are a hundred
percent automated we have clean energy
so at that point we could use technology
breakthroughs to get everything that we
want it and if anyone is still working
at that point they're working as a form
of expressing their creativity they're
working because it's in them to
contribute and to build a design things
but I don't think capitalism is evil
capitalism is actually good it's just
that it gets hijacked it gets hijacked
by improper pricing of xq-- maladies it
gets hijacked by improper deals where
that you have corruption or you have
monopolies over all capitalism is
intrinsic to the human species
capitalism is not something we invented
capitalism is not even something we
discovered it is innate to us in every
exchange that we have when you and I
exchange information I want some
information back from you I give you
information you give me information if
we weren't having a good information
exchange you go talk to somebody else so
the notion of exchange and keeping track
of credits and debits this is built into
us as flexible social animals we are the
only animal
in the animal kingdom that cooperate
across genetic boundaries most animals
doesn't cooperate but when they do they
cooperate only in packs where they Co
evolved together and they share blood so
they have some shared interests humans
don't have that and what lets us
cooperate it's because we can keep track
of debits and credits who put in how
much work who contributed how much
that's all free market capitalism is so
I strongly believe that it is innate to
the human species and we are going to
create more and more wealth and
abundance for everybody everybody can be
wealthy everybody can be retired
everybody can be successful it is merely
a question of Education and desire you
have to want it if you don't want it
that's fine then you opt out of the game
but don't try and put down the people
who are playing the game because that's
the game that keeps you in a comfortable
warm bed at night that's the game that
keeps a roof over your head that's a
game that keeps your supermarket's stock
that's the game that keeps the iphone
buzzing in your pocket so it is a
beautiful game that is worth playing
ethically rationally morally socially
for the human race and it's gonna
continue to make us all richer and
richer until we have massive wealth
creation for anybody who wants it and
it's not just individual secretly
despising wealth right there's countries
groups political parties that overtly
despise wealth or at least seem to
that's right and so what those countries
political parties and groups are reduced
playing the zero-sum king of status and
the process to destroy wealth creation
they dragged everybody down to their
level
which is why the u.s. is a very popular
country for immigrants because it's the
American dream anyone can come here
pretty poor and then work really hard
and make money and get wealthy but even
just make some basic money for their
lives
obviously the definition of wealth is
different for different people a first
of all citizens definition of wealth
might be oh I have to make millions of
dollars and I'm completely done where's
to a third-world poor immigrant just
entering the country and we were poor
immigrants who came here when I was
fairly young to the United States wealth
may just be a much lower number it may
just be that I don't have to work a
manual labor job for the rest of my life
that I don't want work but groups that
despise it will essentially bring the
entire group down to that level if you
get too many takers and not enough
makers society falls apart you're in
with a communist country look with
Venezuela right they were so busy taking
and dividing and reallocating that
people are literally starving in the
streets and losing kilograms of body
weight every year just do sheer
starvation another way think about it
imagine an organism that has too many
parasites you actually need some small
number of parasites to stay healthy and
you need a lot of symbols like all the
mitochondria in all of our cells that
help us respirate and burn oxygen these
are symbols that help us survive we can
survive without them but to me those are
partners in the wealth creation that
creates the human body but if you just
were filled with parasites if you've got
infected with worms or a virus or
bacteria that were purely parasitical
you would die so any organism can only
withstand a small number of parasites
and when the parasitic element gets too
far out of control you die so you know
that again I'm talking about ethical
wealth patient and the time when
monopolies and that I'm not promoting
capitalism I'm gonna talk about miss
price externalities like the environment
I'm talking about free minds and free
markets small steel exchange between
humans that's voluntary and doesn't have
an outsize impact on others but I think
that kind of wealth creation if a
society does not respect it the group
does not respect it that society will
plunge into ruin and darkness obviously
we want to be wealthy and we want to get
there in this lifetime without having to
rely on luck a lot of people think
making money is about luck it's not it's
about becoming the kind of person that
makes money you know I like to think
that if I lost all my money and if you
drop me on a random street in any
english-speaking country within five ten
years I'd be wealthy again right because
it's just a skill set that I've
developed and I think anyone can develop
you know in a thousand parallel
universes you want to be wealthy in 999
of them you don't want to be wealthy the
50 of them where you got lucky so we
want to factor luck out of it there's
really four kinds of luck that we were
talking about this came from a book P
marca Marc Andreessen wrote a blog post
about it
but there's different kinds of luck the
first kind of luck he might just say is
that blind luck where I just got lucky
because something completely out of my
control happened you know that's fortune
that's fate etc then there's luck that
comes through persistence hard work
soeul motion which is when you're just
running around creating lots of
opportunities you're generating a lot of
energy you're doing a lot of things lots
of things will just get stirred up in
the dust it's almost like mixing a petri
dish and seeing what combines or mixing
a bunch of reagents and seeing what
combines you're just generally in a
force and hustle and energy that luck
will find you a third way is that you
just become very good at spotting luck
so if you are very skilled in a field
you will notice when a lucky break
happens in that field and other people
who aren't attuned to it won't notice so
you become sensitive to luck and that's
the skill and knowledge and work and
then the last kind of luck is the
weirdest hardest kind but that's what we
want to talk about which is where you
build a unique character a unique brand
a unique mindset where then luck finds
you for example let's say that you're
the best person in the world at deep-sea
underwater diving and you're known to
like take on Deep Sea underwater dives
that nobody else will even attempt to
dare and then by sheer luck somebody
finds a sunken treasure ship off the
coast they can't get at well their luck
just became your luck because they're
gonna come to you to get that treasure
and you're gonna get paid for it now
that's an extreme example but it's just
showing how like the person who got
lucky but find the treasure chest that
was blind luck but then coming to you
and asking you to extract it and having
to give you half that's not luck you
created your own luck you put yourself
in a position to be able to capitalize
on that luck or to attract that luck
when nobody else has created that
opportunity for themselves so when we
talked about without getting lucky we
want to be deterministic we don't want
to leave it to chance do you want to
elaborate a little bit more on the idea
that in a thousand parallel universes
you want to get rich in 999 of them I
think some people are going to see that
and say that sounds impossible sounds
like it's too good to be true no I don't
think it's impossible I think that you
may have to work a little bit harder at
it given your starting circumstances I
mean remember I started as a poor kid in
India right so if I can make it anybody
can in that sense now obviously I had
all my limbs and I had my mental
faculties and I did have an education so
there are some prerequisites you can't
get past but if you're listening to this
video or podcasts you probably have the
requisite means at your disposal which
is a functioning body and a functioning
mind and I have encountered plenty of
bad luck along the way first a little
fortune that I made I instantly lost in
the stock market
the second little fortune that I made or
I should have made I got cheated by my
business partners it's only the third
time around has been a charm and even
then it has been a slow and steady
struggle and I haven't made money in my
life in one giant payout it's always
been a whole bunch of small things
piling up so it's more about
consistently creating wealth by creating
businesses and quitting opportunities
and creating investments it hasn't been
like a giant one-off thing my personal
wealth has not been generated by one a
big year it just stacks up little bit
chips at a time more options more
businesses more investments more things
that can do same way someone like in a
nod
gala service he's building his brand
online he's building videos it's not
like any one video is going to suddenly
shower him with riches overnight it's
going to be a long lifetime of learning
of reading of creating this is gonna
compound so we're talking about getting
wealthy so you can retire so you have
your freedom I'm not retired a sense
that you don't do anything but in the
sense that you don't have to be any
place you don't want to be you don't
have to do anything you don't want to do
and you can wake up when you want you
can sleep and you want you don't have a
boss that's freedom so we're talking
about enough wealth to get to freedom
and especially thanks to the Internet
these days those opportunities are
massively abundant I in fact have too
many ways to make money I don't have
enough time
I literally have opportunities pouring
out of my ears and the thing I keep
running out of this time there's just so
many ways to create wealth to create
products to create businesses to create
opportunities and to as a by-product get
paid by society that I just can't even
handle it all I think it's pretty
interesting that the first three kinds
of luck that you described there are
very common cliches for them that
everybody knows and then for that last
kind of luck that comes to you out of
the unique way that you act there's no
real cliche for it so for the first
three kinds there is dumb luck or
fine luck that's the first kind of luck
the second kind of luck does the cliche
that fortune favors the bold that's a
person who gets lucky just by stirring
the pot and acting the third kind of
luck people say that chance favors the
prepared mind but for the fourth kind of
luck there is not really a common cliche
out there that matches the unique
character of your action which i think
is interesting and perhaps an
opportunity and it also just shows that
people aren't necessarily taking
advantage of that kind of luck the way
they should be I think also at that
point it starts becoming so
deterministic that it stops being luck
so the definition starts fading from
luck to more destiny so I would
characterize that fourth one is you
build your character in a certain way
and then your character becomes your
destiny one of the things I think that
is important to making money when you
want the kind of reputation that makes
people do deals through you you know I
use the example of like if you're a
great diver then treasure hunters will
come and give you a piece of the
treasure for your diving skills if
you're a trusted reliable high integrity
long-term thinking deal maker then when
other people want to do deals but they
don't know how to do them in a
trustworthy manner with strangers they
will literally approach you and give you
a cut of the deal or offer you a unique
deal just because of the integrity and
reputation that you've built up Warren
Buffett he gets offered deals and he
gets to buy companies and he gets to
file warrants and bail out banks and do
things that other people can't do
because of his reputation but of course
that's fragile
it has accountability on the line it has
a strong brand on the line and as we
will talk about later that comes with
accountability attached but I would say
your character your reputation these are
things that you can build that then will
let you take out advantages of
opportunities that other people may
characterize as lucky but you know that
it wasn't luck you said that this fourth
kind of luck is more or less a destiny
there's a quote from that original book
that was in Mark's blog posts from
Benjamin Disraeli who I think was the
former prime minister of the UK the
quote to describe the
kind of luck was we make our fortunes
and we call them fate there were a
couple other interesting things about
this kind of luck that were mentioned in
the blog post I think it'll be good for
the listeners to hear about is that this
fourth kind of luck can almost come out
of eccentric ways that you do your
things and that eccentricity is not
necessarily a bad thing in this case in
fact it's a good thing yeah absolutely
because the world is a very efficient
place so everyone has dug through all
the obvious places to dig and so to find
something that's new and novel and
uncovered it helps to be operating on a
frontier where right there you have to
be a little eccentric to be out on the
frontier by yourself and then you just
have to be willing to dig deeper than
other people do deeper than seems
irrational just because you're
interested yeah the two quotes that I've
seen that expressed this kind of luck in
addition to that Benjamin Disraeli one
are this one from Sam Altman where he
said extreme people get extreme results
I think that's pretty nice and then
there's this other one from Jeffrey
Pfeffer who is a professor at Stanford
that you can't be normal and expect
abnormal returns
I've always enjoyed that one too yeah
and one quote that I like which is the
exact opposite of that is play stupid
games win stupid prizes all right a lot
of people spend a lot of their time
playing social games like on Twitter
where you're just trying to improve your
social standing and you basically win
stupid social prizes which are worthless
I guess the last thing that I have from
this blog post is just the idea that by
pursuing these kinds of luck especially
the last one basically everything but
dumb luck by pursuing them you
essentially run out of unlock so if you
just keep stirring the pot and stirring
the pot that alone you will run out of
unlock yeah or it could just be
reversion to the mean right so then you
at least neutralize luck so that it's
your own talents that come into play
next you go into more specific details
on how you can actually get rich and how
you can't get rich the first point was
about how you're not going to get rich
you're not going to get rich renting of
your time you must own equity up
piece of the business to gain your
financial freedom this is probably one
of the absolute most important points
people seem to think that you can create
wealth and make money through work and
it's probably not going to work there
are many reasons for that but the most
basic is just that your inputs are very
closely tied to your outputs in almost
any salary job even at one that's paying
a lot per hour like a lawyer or a doctor
you're still putting in the hours and
every hour you get paid so what that
means is when you're sleeping you're not
earning when you're retired you're not
earning when you're in vacation you're
not earning and you can't earn
nonlinearly if you look at even doctors
who get rich like really rich it's
because they open a business they open
like a private practice and then private
practice builds a brand and that brand
attracts people or they build some kind
of medical device or a procedure or a
process where they've intellectual
property so essentially you're working
for somebody else and that person is
taking on the risk and has the
accountability and the intellectual
property and the brand so they're just
not gonna pay you enough they're gonna
pay you the bare minimum that they have
to to get you good a job and that can be
a high bare minimum but it's still not
gonna be true wealth where you're
retired and then finally you're actually
just not even creating that much
original for society like I said this
tweets term should have been called how
to create wealth
it's just how to get rich with a more
catchy title but you're not creating new
things for society you're just doing
things over and over and you're
essentially replaceable because you're
now doing a set role most set roles can
be taught if they can be taught like in
a school then eventually you'll be
competing with someone who's got more
recent knowledge who's been taught and
is coming in to replace you you're much
more likely to be doing a job that can
be eventually replaced by a robot or by
an AI and it doesn't have to be a
wholesale replaced overnight Akemi
replace a little bit of a time and that
eats into your wealth creation and
therefore you're earning capability so
fundamentally your inputs are matched to
your outputs you are replaceable and
you're not being creative I just don't
think that that is the way that you can
truly make money so everybody who really
makes money at some point owns a piece
of a product or a business or some kind
of IP that can be through stock options
so if you
be working a tech company that's a fine
way to start but usually the real wealth
is created by starting your own
companies or by you know even investors
there in an investment for them and
they're buying equity so these are much
more the routes to wealth it doesn't
come to the hours you really just want a
job or a career or profession where your
inputs don't matter your outputs so if
you look at modern society I get into
later in the tweet storm businesses that
have high creativity and high leverage
tends to be ones where you could do an
hour of work and it can have a huge
effect or you can do a thousand hours of
working can have no effect for example
look at software engineering one great
engineer can for example create Bitcoin
and create billions of dollars with the
value an engineer who's working on the
wrong thing or not quite as good or just
not a creative or thoughtful or whatever
can work for an entire year and every
piece of code they ship and whatnot
getting used customers don't want it
that is an example of a profession where
the input and the outputs are highly
disconnected it's not based on the
number of hours that you put in whereas
on the extreme other end if you're a
lumberjack even the best lumberjack in
the world assuming they're not working
with tools so the inputs and outputs
really connected they're just using an
axe or a saw the best lumberjack in the
world maybe like 3x better than one of
the worst Lumberjacks right it's not
going to be a gigantic difference so you
want to look for professions and careers
where the inputs and the outputs are
highly disconnected this is another way
of saying that you want to look for
things that are leveraged and by
leverage I don't mean financial leverage
alone like Wall Street uses and that has
a bad name I'm just talking about tools
we're using tools computer is a tool
that software engineers use if I'm a
lumberjack with bulldozers and automatic
robot axes and saws I'm gonna be using
tools and have more leverage than
someone who's just using his bare hand
and try to rip the trees out by their
roots tools and leverage are what create
this disconnection between inputs and
outputs creativity so the higher the
creativity component of a profession the
more likely it is to have disconnected
inputs and outputs so I think that if
you're looking at professions where
you're inputting your outputs are highly
connected it's gonna be very very very
hard to create wealth and make wealth
for yourself in that process any other
big thing
you should avoid other than renting out
your time yeah there are two tweets that
I put out that are related so the first
one is talking about beer or something
like how it your lifestyle you know has
to upgrade shouldn't get upgraded too
fast and that one said people who are
living far below their means
enjoy your freedom that people busy
upgrading their lifestyles just can't
fathom and I think that's very important
like just to not upgrade your lifestyle
all the time to maintain your freedom
and it just gives your freedom of
operation once you make a little bit of
money you still want to be living like
your old self so that's just the worry
goes away so don't want to upgrade that
house lifestyle and all that stuff let's
say you're gonna get a thousand dollars
an hour the problem is that when you go
into a work lifestyle like that you
don't just suddenly go from making
twenty dollars an hour to making a
thousand dollars an hour that's a
progression over a long career and as
that happens one subtle problem is that
you upgrade your lifestyle as you make
more and more money and that upgrading
of the lifestyle ups what you consider
to be wealth and you stay in this wage
slave trap so I forget who said it maybe
it was nothing too late but he said you
know the most dangerous things are
heroin and a monthly salary right
because they're highly addictive the way
you want to get wealthy is you want to
be poor and working and working and
working and this is for example how the
tech industry works well you don't make
any money for ten years and then
suddenly in year 11 you might have a
giant payday which is what by the way
one reason why these very high marginal
tax rates for the so-called wealthy or
flawed because the highest risk taking
most creative professions literally lose
money for a decade over your life while
you take massive risk and you bleed and
bleed and bleed and then suddenly in
year 11 or year 15 you might have one
single big payday but then of course
Uncle Sam show up and say hey you know
what you just made a lot of money this
year therefore you're rich therefore
you're evil and you got to hand it all
over to us so it just destroys those
kinds of creative risk-taking
professions but ideally you want to make
your money in discrete lumps separated
over long periods of time so that your
own lifestyle does not have a chance to
adapt quickly and then you can say okay
now I'm done now I'm retired now I'm
free I'm still gonna work because you
got to do something with your life but
I'm gonna work on only the things that I
want when I
want and to be much more creative
expression and much less about money
you're not going to get rich renting out
your time but you say that you will get
rich by giving society what it wants but
does not yet know how to get at scale
that's right so essentially I could we
talked about before money is IO used
from society saying you did something
good in the past now here's something
that we owe you for the future and so
society will pay you for creating things
that it wants but society doesn't yet
know how to create those things because
if it did it would need you they would
already be stamped out big time almost
everything is in your house and your
workplace and on the street used to be
technology at one point in time at the
time when oil was technology that made
JD rockefeller rich there's a time when
cars were technology that made Henry
Ford rich so technology is just a set of
things as Alan Kay said that don't quite
work yet once something works is no
longer technology so society always
wants new things and if you want to be
wealthy you want to figure out which one
of those things you can provide for
society that it does not yet know how to
get but it will want that's natural to
you and within your skill set within
your capabilities and then you have to
figure out to scale it because if you
just build one of it that's not enough
you gotta build thousands or hundreds of
thousands or millions or billions of
them so everybody can have one Steve
Jobs and his team of course figured out
that society would want smart phones
computer in their pocket that had all
the phone capability times a hundred and
be easy to use so they figured out how
to build that and then they figured out
how to scale it and they figured out how
to get one into every first world
citizens pocket and eventually every
third world citizen to and so because of
that they're heavily rewarded an Apple
is the most valuable company in the
world the way I tried to put it was that
the entrepreneurs job is to try to bring
the high-end to the mass market it
starts as high-end first it starts as an
act of creativity first you create just
because you want it you want it and you
know how to build it and you need it and
so you build it for yourself then you
figure out how to get it to other people
and then for a little while rich people
have it like for example rich people had
chauffeur
then they had black town cars and then
uber came along and everyone's private
driver it was available to everybody and
now you can even see Ober pools that are
replacing shuttle buses because it's
more convenient and then you get
scooters which are even further down
market of that so you're right it's
about distributing what rich people used
to have to everybody but the
entrepreneurs job starts even before
that which is creation entrepreneurship
is essentially an act of creating
something new from scratch predicting
the society will want it and then
figuring out how to scale it and get it
to everybody in a profitable way in a
self-sustaining way let's look at this
next tweet which I thought was cryptic
and also super interesting about the
kind of job or career that you might
have you said the Internet has massively
broaden the possible space of careers
most people haven't figured this out yet
the fundamental property of the internet
more than any other single thing is it
connects every human to each other human
on the planet
you can now reach everyone whether it's
by emailing them personally lettuce by
broadcast into them on Twitter whether
it's by posting something on Facebook
that they find whether it's by putting
up a website they come in access it
connects everyone to everyone so the
Internet is an inter networking tool it
connects everybody that is its
superpower so you want to use that what
that helps you figure out is that the
internet means that you can find your
audience for your product or your talent
and skill no matter how far away they
are for example may not who's
illustrators if he was in these videos
pre-internet how would he get the
message out there it would just be what
would he do he would run around where he
lives in his neighborhood showing it to
people a computer or a screen or he
would try to get it played in his local
movie theater it was impossible it only
works because he can put it on the
Internet and then how many people in the
world are really interested in it or
even interested in what we're talking
about really gonna absorb it right it's
gonna be a very small subset of humanity
the key is being able to reach them so
what the internet does is allows any
niche obsession which could be just the
weirdest thing it could be like people
who collect snakes they're like people
who like to ride hot-air balloons the
people who like to sail around the world
by themselves just one person on a craft
or someone who's obsessed with miniature
cooking like there's this whole Japanese
nature cooking
phenomenon or there's a show about a
woman goes in people's houses and tidies
it up right so whatever niche obsession
you have the Internet allows of the
scale now that's not to say that what
you build will be the next Facebook
reach billions of users but if you just
want to reach 50,000 passionate people
like you there's an audience out there
for you so the beauty of this is that we
have 7 billion beings on this planet the
combinatorial of human DNA are
incredible everyone is completely
different you'll never meet any two
people who are even vaguely similar to
each other that can substitute for each
other it's not you can say well maybe
just left my life so I can have this
other person come in and he's just like
maybe and I get the same feelings let's
say in responses and the same ideas no
there are no substitutes for people
people are completely unique so given
that each person has different skill
sets different interests different
obsessions and it's that diversity that
becomes a creative superpower so each
person can be creatively superb at their
own unique thing but before that didn't
matter because if you were living a
little fishing village in Italy like
your fishing village didn't literally
need your completely unique skill and
you had to conform to just a few jobs
that were available but now today you
can be completely unique you can go out
on the internet and you can find your
audience and you can build a business
and create a product and build wealth
and make people happy
just uniquely expressing yourself
through the internet space of careers
has been so broaden eSports players
people making millions of dollars x
fortnight people creating videos and
uploading them youtube broadcasters
bloggers you know a podcasters Joe Rogan
I read true or false I don't know but I
read that he's going to make about a
hundred million dollars a year on his
podcast and he's had two billion
downloads even PewDiePie is a hilarious
tweet that every tweeted the other day
PewDiePie is the number one trusted name
in news this is a kid I think in Sweden
and he's got three times the
distribution of the top cable news
networks just on his news channel it's
not even on his entertainment channel
the internet enables any niche interest
as long as you're the best at it to
scale out and the great news is because
every human is different everyone is the
best at something you being themselves
another tweet I had that is worth
weaving in but didn't go into this tweet
storm was a very simple one I liked
things from making
them down because they're easy to
remember it easy to hug on to but that
one was escape competition through
authenticity so when you're competing
with people it's because you're copying
them it's because you're trying to do
the same thing but every human is
different don't copy I know where
magnetic creatures and rené girard has a
whole new message theory but it's much
easier than that don't imitate don't
copy just do your own thing no one can
compete with you on being you it's that
simple and so the more authentic you are
to who you are and what you love to do
the less competition you're gonna have
so you can escape competition through
authenticity when you realize that no
one can compete with you on being you
and normally that would have been
useless advice pre internet post
Internet you can turn that into a career
talk a little bit about what industries
you should think about working in what
kind of job you should have and who you
might want to work with so you said one
should pick an industry where you can
play long-term games with long-term
people why yeah this is an insight into
what makes Silicon Valley work and what
makes high trust societies work
essentially all the benefits in life
come from compound interests whether
it's in relationships or making money or
in learning so compound interest is a
marvelous force where it's like you know
you start out with one X what you have
and then if you increased 20 percent a
year for 30 years it's not that you got
30 years x 20 percent added on it was
compounding so it just grew grew and
grew until you suddenly got a massive
amount of whatever it is whether it's
goodwill or love or relationships or
money so I think compound interest is a
very important force you have to go to
play a long-term game and long-term
games are good matches for compound
interest they're also good for trust if
you look at prisoner's dilemma type
games the solution to prisoner's dilemma
is tit for tat which is I'm just gonna
do to you what you did last time to me
with some forgiveness in case there was
a mistake made but that only works in an
iterated prisoner's dilemma in other
words if we play the game multiple times
so if you're in a situation like for
example you're in Silicon Valley where
people are doing business with each
other and they know each other they
trust each other then they do right by
each other because they know this person
will be around for the next game now of
course that doesn't always work because
you can make so much money in one move
in Silicon Valley
sometimes you
betray each other because they're just
like I'm gonna get rich enough of office
that I don't care so there can be
exceptions to all these circumstances
but essentially if you want to be
successful you have to work with other
people and you have to figure out who
can you trust
and who can you trust over a long long
period of time that you can just keep
playing the game with them so that
compound interest in high trust will
make it easy to play the game and will
let you collect the major rewards which
are usually at the end of the cycle so
for example Warren Buffett has done
really well as an investor in the US
stock market but the biggest reason he
could do that was because the US stock
market has been stable and around and
didn't get for example seized by the
government during a bad administration
or the u.s. didn't plunge in some war
the underlying platform didn't get
destroyed so in his case he was playing
a long-term game and the trust came from
the US stock market stability in Silicon
Valley the trust comes from the network
of people in the small geographic area
that you figure out over time who you
can work with who you can't if you keep
switching locations you keep switching
groups let's say you started out in the
woodworking industry and you build up a
network there and you're working hard
you're trying to build a product in
woodworking industry and then suddenly
another industry comes along that's
adjacent but different but you don't
really know anybody in it and you want
to dive in and make money there if you
keep hopping from industry you know
actually I need to open a line of
electric car stations for electric car
refueling that might make sense it might
be the best opportunity but every time
you reset every time you wander out of
where you built your network you're
gonna be starting from scratch you're
not gonna know who to trust they're not
gonna trust you they're also industries
in which people are transient by
definition they're always coming in and
going out
politics is an example of that right in
politics new people are being elected
you see in politics that when you have a
lot of old-timers like the Senate people
have been around for a long time and
they've been career politicians yeah
they love them downside the career
politicians that corruption but an
upside is they actually get deals done
with each other because they know the
other person is gonna be in the same
position ten years from now and they
have to keep dealing with them so they
might as well learn how to cooperate
where every time you get like a new
incoming freshman class in the House of
Representatives which turns over every
two years the big wave election nothing
gets done because a lot of fighting
because I just got here I don't know you
I don't know if you're gonna be around
why should I work with you rather than
just try and do whatever I think is
right so it's important to pick an
industry where you can play long-term
games and with long-term people so those
people have to signal that they're going
to be around for a long time that
they're ethical and their ethics are
visible to their action in a long-term
game it seems that everybody is making
each other rich and in a short-term game
it seems like everybody is making
themselves rich I think that is a
brilliant formulation yeah in a
long-term game it's positive some we're
all baking acquired together we're
trying to make it as big as possible in
a short-term game we're cutting up the
pie now this is not to excuse the
Socialists right the Socialists those
people who are not involved in baking
the pie who show up at the end and say I
want a slice or I want the whole pie
they show up with the guns but I think a
good leader doesn't take credit a good
leader tries to inspire people's that
the team get the job done and then
things get divided up according to
fairness and who contributed how much or
as close to it as possible and took a
risk as opposed to just whoever has the
longest night the sharpest knives at the
end so these next two tweets are play
iterated games all returns in life
whether in wealth relationships or
knowledge come from compound interest
yeah when you have been doing business
with somebody you've been friends with
somebody for 10 years 20 years 30 years
it just gets better and better because
you trust them so easy if the friction
goes down you can do bigger and bigger
things together for example you know the
simplest one is getting married to
someone having kids and raising children
like that's compound interest right
investing in those relationships those
relations and would be invaluable
compared to more casual relationships
it's true in health and fitness you know
the fitter you are the easier it is to
stay fit where's the more you'd
deteriorate your body the harder it is
to come back and claw your way back to a
baseline and requires heroic acts
regarding compound interest I think I
saw you retweet something awhile back
maybe it was from Edie
Lattimore it went something along the
lines of get some traction get purchase
and don't lose it so the idea was to
gain some initial traction and never
fall back
just keep ratcheting up and up I don't
remember exactly but I think that was
right yeah I was a kid traction
don't let go it was a good one yeah in
terms of pick people to work with that I
have high intelligence high energy and
high integrity I find that's the three
part checklist that you cannot
compromise on you need someone who's
smart or they're heading in the wrong
direction and you're not gonna end up in
the right place you need someone high
energy because the world is full of
smart lazy people we all know people in
our lives are really smart but you know
can't get out of bed or lift a finger
and we also know people have a very high
energy but not that smart so they work
hard but then running in the wrong
direction and smart it's not a
pejorative it's not meant to be like
someone smart someone else is stupid but
it's more than everyone's smart at
different things so depending on what
you want to do well you have to find
someone who's smart at that thing and
then energy a lot of times people are
unmotivated for a specific thing but
they're not motivated for other things
for example someone might be really
unmotivated to go to a job and sit in an
office but they might be really
motivated to go paint right well in that
case they should be a painter they
should be putting art up on the internet
trying to figure out how to build a
career out of that rather than wearing a
collar around their neck and going to a
dreary job and then high integrity is
the most important because otherwise it
got the other two what you have is you
have a smart and hardworking crook who's
eventually gonna cheat you so you have
to figure out if the person is high
integrity and as we talked about the way
you do that is through signals and
signals is what they do not what they
say it's all the nonverbal stuff that
people do when they think nobody's
looking with respect to the energy there
was this interesting thing from Sam
Altman a while back where he was talking
about delegation and even saying one of
the important things for delegation is
delegate to people who are actually good
at the thing that you want to do it's
the most obvious thing but it seems like
you want to partner with people who are
naturally going to do the things that
you want them to do yeah I almost won't
start a company or hire a person or work
with somebody if I just don't think
they're into what I wanted to do when I
was younger I used to try and talk
people into things I was in this idea
you can sell someone into doing
something but you can't you can't keep
them motivated you can get them inspired
initially it might work if you're a king
like Henry the fifth you're trying to
get them to just charge in the battle
and then they'll figure it out but if
you're trying to keep someone motivated
for the long term but motivation has to
come intrinsically you can't just create
it nor can you
be the crutch for them if they don't
have that intrinsic motivation so you
have to make sure people actually are
high-energy and want to do what you want
them to do what you want to work with
them reading signals is very very
important signals are what people do
despite what they say so it's important
to pay attention to subtle signals we
all know that socially if someone treats
a waiter or waitress in a restaurant and
we badly then it's only a matter of time
until they treat you badly if somebody
screws over an enemy and is vindictive
towards them well it's only a matter of
time before they redefine you from
friend to enemy and you feel their wrath
so angry outraged vindictive short-term
thinking people are essentially that way
in many interactions in their life
people are oddly consistent it's one of
things you learn about them so you want
to find long-term people you want to
find people who seem irrationally
ethical for example I had one friend of
mine it was company I invested in and
the company failed and he could have
wiped out all the investors but he kept
putting more and more personal money in
through three different pivots he put
personal money in until the company
finally succeeded and in the process he
never what got the investors and I was
always grateful to him for that I said
like wow that's amazing that you know
you were so good to your investors you
didn't wipe them out and he got offended
by that he said I didn't do it for you I
didn't do it for my investors I did it
for me it's my own self-esteem it's what
I care about that's how I live my life
that's the kind of person you want to
work with another quote that I like I
would tweet on this I think I read this
somewhere else which me said I'm not
taking credit for this but I modified a
little bit which is that self-esteem is
a reputation that you have with yourself
you'll always know so good people moral
people ethical people easy to work with
people reliable people tend to have very
high self-esteem because they have very
good reputation with themselves and they
understand that it's not ego self esteem
and ego are different things because ego
can be undeserving but self esteem at
least you feel like you lived up to your
own internal moral code of ethics and so
it's very hard to work with people who
end up being low integrity that it's
hard to figure out who's high integrity
and low integrity generally the more
someone is saying that their moral and
ethical and high integrity the less
likely they're to be that way it's very
much like status signaling if you
overtly bid for star
if you already talked about being high
status that is a low status move
if you openly talk about how honest and
reliable and trustworthy you are you're
probably not that honest and trustworthy
that is a characteristic of conman
so yeah picking an industry in which you
can play long-term games with long-term
people let's look at this last tweet you
said don't partner with cynics and
pessimists their beliefs are
self-fulfilling yeah essentially to
create things you have to be a rational
optimist rational in the sense that you
have to go see the world for what it
really is and yet you have to be
optimistic about your own capabilities
and your tymberlee to get things done we
all know people who are consistently
pessimistic who will shoot down
everything everyone in their life has
like the helpful critical guy right he
thinks he's being helpful but he's
actually being critical and he's a
downer on everything that person will
not only never do anything great in
their lives they'll prevent other people
around them for doing something great
they think their job is to shoot holes
in things and it's okay to shoot holes
in things as long as you come up with a
solution there's also the classic like
military line I will lead follow or get
out of the way and these people want a
fourth option well they don't want to
lead they don't want to follow but they
don't want to get out of the way they
want to tell you why the things not
going to work and all the really
successful people I know have a very
strong action bias they just do things
the easiest way to figure out if
something is viable or not is by doing
it at least do the first step in the
second step in the third and then decide
so if you want to be successful in life
creating wealth or having good
relationships or being fit or even being
happy you need to have an action bias
towards getting what you want
and you have to be optimistic about it
not irrationally there's nothing worse
than someone who's is the foolhardy and
chasing that's not work that's that's a
rational optimist but you have to be
rational know all the pitfalls know the
downsides but still keep your chin up I
mean you've got one life on this planet
why not try to build something big this
is the beauty of Elon Musk and why I
think he inspires so many people is just
when he takes on really really big
audacious tasks and he provides an
example for people to think big and it
takes a lot of work to build even small
things I don't think the corner grocery
store owner is working any less hard
than Elon Musk
pouring any less sweat and toil into it
maybe even more but for whatever reason
you know education circumstance they
didn't get the chance to think as big so
the outcomes not as big so it's just
better to think big obviously rationally
within your means stay optimistic the
cynics and the pessimists what they're
really saying and fortunate but they're
saying I've given up I don't think I can
do anything and so the world to me just
looks like a world where nobody can do
anything and so why should you go do
something because if you fail then I'm
right which is great but if you succeed
and you just make me look bad yeah it's
probably better to be an irrational
optimist than it is to be a rational
cynic yeah there's a completely rational
frame on why you should be an optimist
historically if you go back 2,000 years
5,000 there's 10,000 years to people are
wandering through a jungle they hear a
tiger one's an optimist and says oh it's
not headed our way the other one says
I'm a pessimist I'm out of here and the
pessimist runs and survives and the
optimist gets eaten so we descended from
pessimists we're genetically hardwired
to be pessimists but modern society is
far far safer there are no Tigers
wandering down the street it's very
unlikely that you will end up in total
ruin although you should avoid total
ruin much more likely if the upside is
unlimited and the downside is limited so
adapting for modern society means
overriding your pessimism and taking
slightly irrationally optimistic bets
because the upside is unlimited if you
start the next SpaceX or Tesla or uber
you can make billions of dollars of
value for society and for yourself and
change the world
and if you fail that's the big deal you
lost a few million dollars and invest
your money and they've got plenty more
and that's the bet they take the chances
that you will succeed it made sense to
be pessimistic in the past it makes
sense to be optimistic today especially
if you're educated and living in a first
world country even a third world country
actually think the economic opportunity
in third world countries are much larger
the one thing you have to avoid is the
risk of ruin ruin means to stay out of
jail
so don't do anything that's illegal it's
never worth it to wear an orange
jumpsuit and stay out of total
catastrophic loss that could mean that
you stay out of things that could be
physically dangerous hurt your body you
have to watch your health and stay out
of things that can cause you to lose all
Capital all of your savings it'll gamble
everything at one go but you take
rationally optimistic bets with big
upside I think there's people that will
try and build up your ideas and build on
your ideas no matter how far-fetched
they might seem and then there are
people who will list out all the obvious
exceptions no matter how obvious they
are and fortunately in the startup world
I don't even really get exposed to the
people that are giving you the obvious
exceptions and all the reasons it's not
going to work I'd barely get exposed to
that anymore absolute way today's forum
Scott Adams got so annoyed by this dude
he came up with the phrase an acronym
which is but of course there are obvious
exceptions BOC ta OE and he used to like
pin that acronym at the end of his
articles for a while but twitterings
just like overrun with nit pickers and
which exactly as you're pointing out
Silicon Valley has learned that the
upside is so great that you never look
down on the slavi kid who's wearing a
hoodie and has like coffee on his shoes
and just look like a slob because you
don't know if he's gonna be the next
Mark Zuckerberg or the next Reid Hoffman
so you gotta treat everybody with
respect you gotta look up to every
possibility and opportunity because the
upside is so unlimited the downside is
so limited in the modern world
especially with financial assets and
instruments you want to talk a little
bit about the skills that you need in
particular specific knowledge
accountability leverage and judgment
so the first tweet in this area is arm
yourself with specific knowledge
accountability and leverage and I'll
throw in judgment as well I don't think
you covered that in that particular
tweet if you want to make money you have
to get paid at scale and why you
that's accountability at scale that's
leverage and just you getting paid as
opposed to somebody else getting paid
that's specific knowledge so specific
knowledge is probably the hardest thing
to get across in this whole tweet storm
and it's probably the thing that people
get the most confused about the thing is
that we have this idea that everything
can be taught everything can be taught
in school and it's not true that
everything can be taught in fact the
most interesting things cannot be taught
but
thing can be learned and very often that
learning either comes from some innate
characteristics in your DNA or it could
be through your childhood where you
learn soft skills which are very very
hard to teach later on in life or it's
something that is brand-new so nobody
else knows how to do it either or it's
true on-the-job training because your
pattern matching into highly complex
environments building judgment in a
specific domain classically example is
investing but it could be in anything it
could be in judgment in running a fleet
of trucks it could be a judgement in
weather forecasting so specific
knowledge is the knowledge that you care
about especially if you're later in life
let's say your post 20 21 22 you almost
don't get to choose which specific
knowledge you have rather you get to
look at what you have already built by
that point in time and then you can
build on top of it
the first thing to notice about specific
knowledge is that you can't be trained
for it if you can be trained for it if
you can go to a class and learn specific
knowledge then somebody else can be
trained for it - and then we can mass
produce and mass train people
heck we even program computers to do it
and eventually we can program robots to
walk around doing it so if that's the
case then you're extremely replaceable
and all we have to pay you is the
minimum wage that we have to pay you to
get you to do it when there are lots of
other takers who can be trained to do it
so really your returns just devolve into
your cost of training plus the return on
investment on that training so you
really want to pick up specific
knowledge you need your schooling you
need your training to be able to
capitalize on the best specific
knowledge but the part of it that Juliet
paid for is the specific knowledge for
example someone who goes and gets a
degree in psychology and then becomes a
salesperson well if they were already a
formidable salesperson I had great
salesmanship to begin with then the
psychology degree is leverage it arms
them and they do much better at sales
but if they were always an introvert
never very good at sales and they're
trying to use psychology to learn sales
they're just not gonna get that great at
it
so civic knowledge is found much more by
pursuing your innate talents your
genuine curiosity and your passion it's
not by going to school for whatever is
the hottest job it's not for going into
whatever field investors
the hottest very often specific
knowledge is at the edge of knowledge
it's also stuff that's just being
figured out or is really hard to figure
out so if you're not 100% into it
somebody else who is 100% into it will
outperform you and they won't just
outperform you by a little bit they'll
outperform you by a lot because now
we're operating the domain of ideas
compound interest
really applies and leverage really
applies so if you're operating with a
thousand times leverage and somebody is
right 80 percent of the time and
somebody is else right 90 percent of
time the person who's right 90 percent
of time will literally get paid hundreds
of times more by the market because of
the leverage and because of the
compounding factors in being correct so
you really want to make sure you're good
at it so they're genuine curiosity is
very important so very often it's not
something you sit down and you reason
about it's more found by observation you
almost have to look back on your own
life and see what you're actually good
at for example I wanted to be a
scientist and that is where a lot of my
moral hierarchy comes from I view
scientists at the top of the production
chain for Humanity and the group of
scientists who have made real
breakthroughs and contributions have
probably added more to human society and
I think than any single other class of
human beings not to take away anything
from art or politics or engineering or
business but without the science you
know we'd still be scrabbling the dirt
fighting with sticks and trying to start
fires my whole value system was built
around scientists and I wanted to be a
great scientist but when I actually look
back at what I was uniquely good at and
what I ended up spending my time doing
it was more around making money
tinkering with technology and selling
people on things explaining things
talking to people so I have some sales
skills which is a form of specific
knowledge that I have I have some
analytical skills around how to make
money and I having this ability to
absorb data obsess about it and break it
down and that is a specific skill that I
have I also just love tinkering with
technology and all of this stuff feels
like play to me but it looks like work
to others so there are other people to
whom these things would be hard they say
like well how do I get good at being
pithy and selling ideas well if you're
not already good at it or they're not
really into it maybe it's not your thing
focus on the thing that you are really
into this is ironic but the first person
that actually point out my real specific
knowledge was my mother and she did it
as an aside talking from the kitchen and
she said it when I was like 15 or 16
years old I was telling a friend of mine
that I wanted to be an astrophysicist
and she said no you're gonna go into
business and I was like what my mom's
telling me I'm gonna be in business I'm
gonna be an astrophysicist mom doesn't
know what she's talking about but mom
knew exactly what she was talking about
she had already observed that every time
we walked down the street I would
critique the local pizza parlor on why
they were selling their slices a certain
way with certain toppings and why the
process of ordering was this way when it
should have been that way so she knew
that I was just had more of a business
curious mind but then my obsession with
science combined to create technology
and technology businesses where I found
myself so very often your specific
knowledge is observed and often observed
by other people who know you well and
reveal in situations rather than
something that you come up with to the
extent that specific knowledge is taught
it's on the job it's through
apprenticeships and that's why the best
businesses the best careers are the
apprenticeship careers because those are
things that society still has not
figured out how to train and automate
yet the classic line here is that Warren
Buffett went to Benjamin Graham when he
got out of school and Benjamin Graham
was the author the intelligent investor
is sort of modernized or created value
investing as a discipline and Warren
Buffett went to Benjamin Graham and
offered to work for him for free and
Graham said actually you're overpriced
free is overpriced and Graham was
absolutely right
that when it comes to a very valuable
apprenticeship like the type that Graham
was going to give Buffett Buffett should
have been paying him a lot of money and
that right there tells you that those
are skills worth knowing specific
knowledge also tends to be technical and
creative so on the bleeding edge of
technology on the bleeding edge of art
on the bleeding edge of communication
even today for example there are
probably meme lords out there on the
internet who can create incredible memes
that will spread the idea to millions of
people or are very persuasive like for
example Scott Adams is a good example
this he's essentially becoming one of
the most credible people in the world by
making accurate predictions through
persuasive arguments and videos and that
is specific knowledge that he has built
up over the
because he got obsessed with hypnosis
when he was young he learned how to
communicate through cartooning he
embraced periscope early so he's been
practicing lots of conversation he's
read all the books on the topic he's
employed it in his everyday life if you
look at his girlfriend she's like this
beautiful young Instagram model that is
an example of someone who has built up a
specific knowledge over the course of
his career it's highly creative it has
elements of being technical in it and
it's something that is never gonna be
automated no one's gonna take that away
from him because he's also accountable
under one brand as Scott Adams and he's
operating with a leverage of media with
periscope and drawing Dilbert cartoons
and writing books he has massive
leverage on top of that brand and he can
build wealth out of it if he wanted to
build additional wealth beyond what he
already has should we be calling it
unique knowledge or the specific
knowledge somehow make more sense for it
you know I came up with his framework
when I was really young and we're
talking decades and decades it's not
probably over 30 years old and so at the
time too specific knowledge stuck with
me so that is how I think about it the
reason I didn't try and change it is
because every other term that I found
for it was overloaded in a different way
at least specific knowledge isn't that
used I can rebrand it the probably
unique knowledge is yeah maybe it's
unique but if I learn it from somebody
else is no longer unique then we both
know it so it's not so much that it is
unique it's that it is highly specific
the situation it's specific to the
individual it's specific to the problem
and it can only be built as part of a
larger obsession interest and time spent
in that domain they can't just be read
straight out of a single book nor can be
taught in a single course nor can it be
programmed into a single algorithm
speaking of Scott Adams he's got a blog
post on how to build your career by
getting in say the top 25 percentile at
three or more things and by doing that
you become the only person in the world
who can do those three things in the
25th percentile so instead of trying to
be the best at one thing you just try to
be very very good at three or more
things is that a way of building
specific knowledge
you think the best way is just to follow
your own obsession and somewhere in the
back of your mind you can realize that
hey actually this obsession like I'll
keep an eye out for the commercial
aspects of it but I think if you go
around trying to build it a little too
deliberately if you become too
goal-oriented on the money then you
won't pick the right thing you won't
actually pick the thing that you love to
do so you won't go deep enough into it
scott adams is observation is a good one
it's predicated on statistics let's say
there's 10,000 areas that are valuable
to the human race today in terms of
knowledge to have and the number one in
those 10,000 slots is taken right
someone else is likely to be the number
one each of those 10,000 unless you
happen to be one of the 10,000 most
obsessed people in the world at a given
thing but when you start going the
combinatorics
of combining well number three thousand
seven or twenty eight with top-notch
sales skills and really good writing
skills and so on with whom understands
accounting and finance really well when
the need for that intersection arrives
you've expanded now from ten thousand
through comminute oryx to millions or
tens of millions so it just becomes much
less competitive also there's
diminishing returns so it's much easier
to be top 75 percentile at three or four
things that is to be literally the
number one at something I think it's a
very pragmatic approach but I think it's
important that one not start assembling
things to deliberately because you do
want to pick things where you are a
natural
everyone is a natural at something we're
all familiar with that phrase unnatural
or this person is that a natural at
meeting men or where this person is a
natural socialite this person is a
natural programmer this person is a
natural reader so whatever you are a
natural at you want to double down on
that and then there are probably
multiple things you are natural that
because personalities and humans are
very complex so we want to be able to
take the things that you are a natural
at and combine them so that you
automatically just through sheer
interest and enjoyment end up top 25 or
top 10 or top 5% at a number of things
talking about combining skills you said
that you should learn to sell learn to
build if you can do both you will be
unstoppable you know this is a very
broad category now but it's too
broad categories one is building the
product which is hard and it's a
multivariate that can include design
that can include development that can
include manufacturing logistics
procurement they could even be designing
and operating a service it has many many
definitions but in every industry there
is a definition of the Builder in our
tech industry that's the CTO as the
programmer is the software engineer a
hardware engineer but you know even in
like a laundry business it could be the
person who's building the laundry
service who is making the trains run on
time who's making sure all the clothes
end up in the right place the right time
and so on then the other side of it is
the sales side again selling has a very
broad definition selling doesn't
actually just mean selling individual
customers but it could mean marketing it
could mean communicating it could mean
recruiting it could mean raising money
it could mean inspiring people it could
be doing PR so it's a broad umbrella
category so generally the Silicon Valley
startup model tends to work fast it's
not the only way but it is probably the
most common way when you have two
founders one of whom is a world-class at
sales and one of whom is world-class at
building an example this course Steve
Jobs and Steve Wozniak with Apple gates
and Allen probably had similar
responsibilities early on with Microsoft
Larry and Sergey you know probably broke
down along those lines although it's a
little different there because that was
a very technical product delivered to
end-users through a simple interface but
generally you will see this pattern
repeated over and over there's a builder
and there's a seller there's a CEO and
CTO combo and the venture and Technology
investors are almost trained to look for
this combo whenever possible it's the
magic combination the ultimate is when
one individual can do both that's when
you get true superpowers that's when you
get people who can create entire
industries the living example is Elon
Musk he may not necessarily building the
Rockets himself but he understands
enough that he actually makes technical
contributions he understands the
technology well enough that no one's
gonna snow him on it and he's not
running around making claims that he
doesn't think he can eventually deliver
he may be optimistic in the timelines
but he thinks it's within reasonableness
of delivery even Steve Jobs develop
enough product skills and was involved
enough in the Prada
that he also operated both of these
domains Larry Ellison starred as a
programmer and I think wrote the first
version of Oracle Rosa actually have
really involved in it Marc Andreessen
was also in this domain he may not have
had enough confidence in the sales
skills but he was the programmer who
wrote Netscape Navigator a big chunk of
it so I think the real Giants in any
field are the people who can both build
and sell and usually the building is the
thing that like a salesperson can't pick
up building later in life it requires
too much focused time but a builder can
pick up selling a little bit later
especially if they were already in Italy
wired to be a good communicator
Bill Gates famously paraphrase this as I
would rather teach an engineer marketing
than a marketer engineering I think if
you start out with a building mentality
and you have building skills and still
early enough in your life or you have
enough focused time that you think you
can learn selling and you have some
natural characteristics for your good
sales person then you can double down on
those now your sales skills could be in
a different than traditional domain so
for example let's say you're a really
good engineer and then people are saying
well now you need to be good at sales
well you may not be good at hand-to-hand
sales but you may be a really good
writer and writing is a skill that can
be learned much more easily than say
in-person selling and so you may just
cultivate writing skills until you
become a good online communicator and
then use that for your sales on the
other hand it could just be that you're
a good builder and you're bad at writing
and you don't like communicate to mass
audiences which are good one-on-one so
then you might use your sales skills for
recruiting or for fundraising which are
more one-on-one kinds of endeavors this
is pointing out that if you're at the
intersection of these two don't despair
because you're not going to be the best
technologist and you're not going to be
the best salesperson but in a weird way
that combination back to the scott adams
skill stack that combination of two is
unstoppable long term people who
understand the underlying product and
how to build it and can sell it these
are catnip to investors these people can
break down walls if they have enough
energy and they can get almost anything
done if you could only pick one to be
good at which one would you pick when
you're trying to stand out from the
noise bill
is actually better because there's so
many hustlers and salespeople who have
nothing to back them up
when you're starting out when you're
trying to be recognized building is
better but much later down the line
building gets exhausting because it is a
focused job and it's hard to stay
current because there's always new
people new products coming up who have
newer tools and frankly more time
because it's very intense is very
focused tasks so sales skills actually
scale better over time like for example
if you have a reputation for building a
great product that's good but when you
ship your new product I'm gonna evaluate
it based on the product but if you have
a reputation for being a good person to
do business with and you're persuasive
and communicative then that reputation
almost becomes self-fulfilling so I
think if you only had to pick one you
can start with building and then
transition to selling this is a cop-out
answer but I think that is actually the
right answer before we go and talk about
accountability and leverage and judgment
you've got a few tweets further down the
line that I would put in the category of
continuous learning they're essentially
there is no skill called business avoid
business magazines in business class
study microeconomics game theory
psychology persuasion ethics mathematics
and computers there's one other comment
that you made in a periscope that was
you should be able to pick up any book
in the library and read it and the last
tweet in this category was reading as
faster than listening doing is faster
than watching yeah the most important
tweet on this I don't even have in here
unfortunately which is the foundation of
learning is reading I don't know a smart
person who doesn't read and read all the
time and the problem is what do I read
how do I read because for most people to
struggle it's it's short so the most
important thing is just to learn how to
educate yourself and the way to educate
yourself is to develop a love for
reading so the tweet that is left out
the one that I was hinting yet is read
what you love until you love to read
it's that simple everybody I know who
reads a lot loves to read and they love
to read because they read books that
they loved it's a little bit of a
catch-22 but you want to start off just
reading wherever you
and then keep building up from there
until reading becomes a habit and then
eventually you will just get bored of a
simple stuff so you may start off
reading fiction then you might graduate
the science fiction then you may
graduate to nonfiction then you may
graduate to science or philosophy or
mathematics or whatever it is but take
your natural path and just read the
things that interest you until you
understand them and then you'll
naturally move to the next thing and the
next thing in the next thing now there
is an exception to this which is where I
was hinting with what things you
actually do want to learn which is at
some point there's too much out there to
read and even reading is full of junk
there are actually things you can read
especially early on that will program
your brain a certain way and then later
things that you read you will decide
whether those things were true or false
based on the earlier things so it is
important that you read foundational
things and foundational things I would
say are the original books in a given
field that are very scientific in their
nature so for example instead of reading
a business book pick up Adam Smith's The
Wealth of Nations instead of reading a
book on biology or evolution that's
written today I would pick up Darwin's
Origin of Species instead of reading a
book on biotech right now that may be
very advanced I would just pick up the
eighth day of creation by Watson and
Crick instead of reading advanced books
on what cosmology and what Neil deGrasse
Tyson and Stephen Hawking have been
saying you can pick up richard fineman
six easy pieces and start with basic
physics if you understand the basics
especially in mathematics and physics
and sciences then you will not be afraid
of any book all of us have that memory
of when we were sitting in class and
we're learning mathematics and it was
all logical and all made sense until at
one point the class moved too fast and
we fell behind and then after that we
were left memorizing equations
memorizing concepts without being able
to drive them from first principles and
that moment were lost because unless
you're professional mathematicians
you're not gonna remember those things
all you're gonna remember are the
techniques the foundations so you have
to make sure that you're building on a
steel frame of understanding because
you're putting together a foundation for
a skyscraper and you're not just
memorizing things because if you're just
memorizing things you're lost
so the foundations are all true
important and the ultimate the ultimat
is when you walk into a library and you
look at it up and down and you don't
fear any book you know that you can take
any book off the shelf you can read it
you can understand it you can absorb
what is true you can reject what is
false and you have a basis for even
working that out that is logical and
scientific and not purely just based on
opinions the beauty of the Internet is
the entire Library of Alexandria times
10 is at your fingertips at all times
it's not the means of education or the
means of learning are scarce the means
of learning are abundant it's the desire
to learn that scarce so you really have
to cultivate that desire and it's not
even cultivating if to not lose it
children have a natural curiosity if you
go to a young child who's first learning
language they're pretty much always
asking what's this what's that why is
this who's that they're always asking
questions but one of the problems is
that schools and our educational system
and even our way of raising children
replaces curiosity with compliance and
once you replace the curiosity with the
compliance you get an obedient factory
worker but you no longer get a creative
thinker and you need creativity you need
that ability to feed your own brain to
learn whatever you want and to me
foundational things are principles there
are algorithms they're deep-seated
logical understanding where you can
defend it or attack it from any angle
and that's why microeconomics is
important because macroeconomics a lot
of memorization a lot of macro
as Nassim Taleb says it is easier to
macro than it is 2 micro
 because macroeconomics is
boodoo complex science meets politics
you can't find two macro economists to
agree on anything these days and
different macro economists get used by
different politicians to peddle their
different pet theories there are even
macro economists out there now peddling
something called modern monetary theory
which says hey except for this pesky
thing called inflation we can just print
all the money that we want yes except
for this pesky thing called inflation
that's like saying instead of limited
energy we can fire rockets off into
space all day long it's just nonsense
but the fact that there are people who
have macroeconomists in their title and
are peddling modern monetary theory
just tells you that macroeconomics as a
so-called science has been corrupted
it's a branch of politics so you really
want to focus on the foundations
foundation the ultimate foundations are
mathematics and logic if you understand
logic and mathematics then you have the
basis for understanding scientific
method once you understand the
scientific method then you can
understand how to separate truth from
falsehood in other fields and other
things that you're reading so be very
careful about reading other people's
opinions and even be careful about
reading facts because so-called facts
are often just opinions but you know
with a veneer around them what you
really are looking for is algorithms but
you're really looking for his
understanding it's better to go through
a book really slowly and struggled and
stumbled and rewind then it is ticks fly
through it quickly and say well now I
read 20 books ever at 30 books I've read
50 books in the field
it's like Bruce Lee said I don't fear
the man who knows a thousand kicks and a
thousand punches I fear the man who's
practiced one punch ten thousand times
or one kick 10,000 times it's the
understanding that comes through
repetition and three usage and through
logic and foundations that really makes
you a smart thinker to lay a foundation
for learning for the rest of your life I
think you need two things if I was gonna
try and sum it up one practical
persuasion and two you need to go deep
in some technical category whether it's
abstract math or you want to read Donald
Knuth books on algorithms or you want to
read fineman's
lectures on physics if you have
practical persuasion and a deep
understanding of some complex topic I
think you'll have a great foundation for
learning for the rest of your life yeah
if I can expand it a little bit I would
say that the five most important skills
are of course reading writing arithmetic
and then as you are adding in persuasion
we're just talking and then finally I
would add computer programming just
because it's an applied form of
arithmetic that just gets you so much
leverage for free in any domain that you
operate in if you're good with computers
if you're good at basic mathematics
you're good at writing if you're good at
speaking and if you like reading you're
set for life so in that sense business
to me is bottom of the barrel there's no
actual skilled call business it's too
generic of a thing it's like a skill
called relating like relating to humans
that's not a skill it's too broad so a
lot of what goes on in business schools
and there's some very intelligent stuff
taught in business schools I don't need
to track from them completely but some
of the stuff that's trying Business
School is essentially just anecdotes
they call it case studies but it's just
anecdotes and they're trying to help you
pattern match by throwing lots of data
points at you but the reality is you
will never understand them fully until
you're actually in that position
yourself even then you will find that
basic concepts from game theory and
psychology and ethics and mathematics
and computers and logic will serve you
much much better so I would focus in the
foundations I would focus with a science
bent I would develop a love for reading
including by reading so-called junk food
that you're not supposed to read you
don't have to read the classics that is
the foundation for your self education
what did you mean when you said that
doing is faster than watching when you
come to your learning curve if you want
to optimize your learning curve one of
the reasons why I don't love podcasts
even though I'm a generator of podcasts
is that I like to consume my information
very quickly and now I'm a good reader a
fast reader and I can read very fast but
I can only listen at a certain speed I
know people listen to 2x 3x but everyone
sounds like a chipmunk and it's hard to
go back it's hard to highlight it's hard
to pinpoint
snippets and save them in your notebook
and so on similarly a lot of people
think they can become really skilled at
something by watching others do it or
even by reading about others doing it
and going back to business school case
study that's a classy example you know
they study other people's businesses but
in reality you're going to learn a lot
more about running a business by
operating your own lemonade stand or
equivalent or even opening a little
retail store down the street that is how
you gonna learn on the job because a lot
of the subtleties don't express
themselves until you're actually in the
business for example everyone's now into
mental models these days right you go to
Farnam Street you go to poor Charlie's
Almanac and you can learn all the
different mental models but which ones
matter more which ones do you apply more
often which
matter which circumstances that's
actually the hard part for example my
personal learning has been that the
principal-agent problem drives so much
in this world it's an incentives problem
you know I've learned that tit-for-tat
iterated prisoner's dilemma is the piece
of game theory that is worth knowing the
most you can literally almost put down
the game theory book after that finally
the best way to learn game theory is to
play lots of games I never even read
game theory books I consider myself
extremely good at game theory I've never
opened up a game theory book and found a
result in there where I was like oh yeah
that's common sense to me because the
reason is I just grew up playing all
kinds of games and I ran into all kinds
of corner cases with all kinds of
friends and so it's just second nature
to me so you can always learn better by
doing on the job but the doing is a
subtle thing that we're doing in capsule
it's a lot so for example let's say I
want to learn how to run a business well
if I start a business where I go in
every day and I'm doing the same thing
with Sam running the retail store that
Street where I'm stocking the shelves
with food and liquor every single day
I'm not gonna learn that much because
I'm repeating things a lot so I'm
putting in thousands of hours but there
are thousands of hours doing the same
thing whereas if I was putting in
thousands of iterations that would be
different so the learning curve is
across iteration so if I was trying new
marketing experiments to store all the
time I was constantly changing out the
inventory I was constantly changing out
the branding in the messaging I was
constantly changing the sign I was
constantly changing the online channels
that I was used to drive foot traffic in
I was experimenting with being open at
different hours if I even had the
ability to walk around and talk to other
store owners and get in their books and
figure out how they're running their
business
it's the number of iterations that
drives a learning curve so the more
iterations you can have the more shots
on goal you can have the faster you're
going to learn it's not just about the
hours put in it's actually a combination
of the two but I think just the way
we're built and the way that the world
presents itself the world offers us very
easily the opportunity to do the same
thing over and over and over again but
really we'd be better served if we went
off and found ways to do new things from
scratch and doing something new the
first time is painful because you're
wandering into unser
territory and high odds are that you
will fail so you just have to get very
very comfortable with frequent small
failures you know Nassim Taleb and talks
about this also he made his fortune his
wealth by being a trader who relied upon
black swans
Nassim Taleb made money by essentially
losing little bits of money every day
and then once in a blue moon he would
make a lot of money when the unthinkable
happened for other people where's most
people want to make little bits of money
every day
and in exchange they'll tolerate lots of
blow-up risks they'll tolerate going
completely bankrupt we're not involved
to bleed a little bit every day if
you're out in the natural environment
and you get a cut and you're literally
bleeding a little bit every day you will
eventually die you have to stop that cut
we're evolved for small victories all
the time but that becomes very expensive
that's where the crowd is that's where
the herd is so if you're willing to
bleed a little bit every day but in
exchange you win big later you will do
better that is by the way
entrepreneurship entrepreneurs bleed
every day they're not making money
they're losing money they're constantly
stressed out all the responsibilities
upon them but when they win they win big
on average they'll make more so why
don't we jump into accountability which
I thought was pretty interesting and I
think you have your own unique take on
it
so the first tweet on accountability was
embrace accountability and take business
risks under your own name Society will
reward you with responsibility equity
and leverage yeah so to get rich you
know you're gonna need leverage and
leverage comes in labor it comes in
capital or it can come through code or
media but most of these like labor and
capital people have to give to you for
labor somebody has to follow you for
capital somebody has to give you money
or assets to manage or machines so to
get these things you to build up
credibility and you have to do those
under your own name as much as possible
which is risky so accountability is a
double-edged thing it allows you to take
credit when things go well and to bear
the brunt of the failure when things go
badly so in that sense you know people
who are stamping their names on things
aren't foolish they're just confident
maybe it turns out to be foolish in the
end but if you look at a Kanye or an
Oprah or a Trump or an Elon or anyone
like that these people can get rich just
off their name
because their name is such powerful
branding you know regardless what you
think of Trump you have to realize that
the guy was among the best in the world
at just branding his name why would you
go to Trump casino used to because Trump
why would you go to Trump Tower because
of Trump when it came time to vote I
think that a lot of voters just went and
said Trump they recognize the name so
the name recognition paid off
same thing with Oprah she puts her brand
on something her name on something and
it flies off the shelves and it's like
instant validator but these people also
take risks for putting their name out
there obviously Trump is now probably
hated by half or more than half of the
country and by a big chunk of the world
he sticks his name out there by putting
your name out there you become a
celebrity and fame has many many
downsides it's better to be anonymous
and rich than to be poor and famous but
even famous and rich has a lot of
downsides associated with it you're
always in the public eye so
accountability is quite important when
you're working to build a product or
you're working on a team or you're
working in a business we are constantly
drummed into our heads how important it
is to be part of a team and absolutely
agree with that a lot of our training
socially is telling us to not stick our
necks out of the crowd this is saying
that I hear from Australian friends I
like the tall poppy gets cut right don't
stick your neck out but I would say that
actually a really really well
functioning team is small and has clear
accountability for each two different
portions like so you can say okay this
person is responsible for building the
product this person is responsible for
the messaging this person is responsible
for raising money this person
responsible for the pricing strategy and
maybe their online advertising so if
somebody screws up you know exactly
who's responsible what at the same time
something goes really well you also know
exactly who's responsible so if you have
a small team and you have clearly
delineated responsibilities then you can
still keep a very high level of
accountability and accountability is
really important because when something
succeeds or fails if it fails everybody
points fingers at each other and if it
succeeds everybody steps forward to take
credit and we've all had that experience
when we were in school and we got like a
group assignment to do and there were
people in there there were probably a
few people in there who did a lot of the
work and then there are few people who
just did a lot of grandstanding or
position
to do the work so we're all familiar
with this from a childhood sense but it
is uncomfortable to talk about but clear
accountability is important without
accountability you don't have incentives
without accountability you can't build
credibility but you take risk so you
take risk of failure you take risk of
humiliation you take risk of failure
under your own name which you know
luckily in modern society there's no
more debtors prison and people don't go
to jail or get executed for losing other
people's money but we're still socially
hardwired to not fail in public under
our own names and the people who have
the ability to fail in public under
their own names actually gain a lot of
power for example I'll give a personal
anecdote up until about 2013 2014 my
public persona was entirely around
startups and investing and only around
2014-2015 did I start talking about
philosophy and psychological things and
broader things and it made me a little
nervous because I was doing it under my
own name and there were definitely
people in the industry who sent me
messages through the back channel like
what are you doing you're ending your
career this is stupid and I just went
with it took a risk
same with crypto early on it took a risk
but when you put your name out there you
take a risk with certain things you also
get to reap the rewards you get the
benefits accountability is important
because that's how you're going to get
leverage that's how you're going to get
credibility it's also how you're going
to get equity you're gonna get a piece
of the business when you're negotiating
with other people ultimately if someone
else is making a decision about how to
compensate you that decision will be
based on how replaceable you are and if
you have high accountability that makes
you less replaceable and then they have
to give you equity which is a piece of
the upside but equity itself is a good
example because equity is also a risk
based instrument equity means you get
paid everything after all the people who
need guaranteed money are paid back so
if you look at the hierarchy of capital
in a company the employees get paid
first they get to pay the salary first
like in the legal proceedings you know
the salaries are sacrosanct if you are a
board member and the company spends too
much money and has back salaries to pay
the government will go after you
personally to pay back the salaries so
the employees get the most security but
in exchange for that security they
don't have as much upside then next in
line would be the debt holders who are
maybe the bankers who lent money to the
company for operations and they need to
make their fixed coupon every month or
every year but they don't get much more
upside beyond that now they might be
making 5 10 15 20 25 % a year but that's
where they're upset is limited to and
then finally are the equity holders and
these people are actually gonna get most
of the upside so once the debt holders
are paid off and the salaries are paid
off whatever remains goes to them but if
there isn't enough money to pay off the
salaries and the debt holders or if
there's just enough to pay off the
salary the debt holders which is what
happens with most businesses most of the
times the equity holders get nothing so
the equity holders take on greater risk
but then they take on in exchange they
get nearly unlimited upside and you can
do the same with all of your work
so essentially taking accountability for
your actions is the same as taking an
equity position in all of your work
you're essentially taking greater
downside risk and greater upside risk
but realize that in modern society the
downside risk is not that large you know
even personal bankruptcy can wipe the
debts clean in good ecosystems I'm most
familiar with Silicon Valley but
generally people will forgive failures
as long as you are honest and made a
high integrity effort so there's not
really that much to fear in terms of
failure and so people should be taking
on a lot more accountability than they
actually are
is accountability actually fragile or do
you really just mean that we're
hardwired not to fail in public so it
just feels like it's a fragile thing I
think it could actually be fragile like
example of accountability is you're an
airplane pilot
but as a captain you're taking on
accountability for the entire plane
let's say that something goes wrong with
the aircraft
you can't literal a mitt on anyone else
you can't blame it on the steward or the
stewardess you can't blame it on the
co-pilot
you're the captain you're responsible
for the ship and if you screw up you
crash the ship and there are immediate
consequences in the old days you know
the captain was expected to go down with
the ship if the ship was sinking
literally the last person who got to get
off was the captain so yeah I think
accountability does come with real risks
but we're talking about in a business
context so the risk here would be that
you would probably be the last one to
get your capital back out
you'd be the last one to get paid for
your time so you know the time that you
put in the capital that you put in into
the company these are what are at risk
even if a business fails then your names
on it that's not as bad as if it turns
out to be an integrity issue like your
Bernie Madoff for example Madoff
investments that name is never going to
be good again in the investment
community you could be Bernie Madoff's
great-great-great-grandson you're not
gonna go into the investment business
cuz you ruin the family name so I think
these days the accountability risk with
the name happens more around integrity
rather than it does around purely
economic failure
the big takeaway for me on
accountability is that you will be
rewarded directly in proportion with
your accountability I also think this is
why people like tala rail against CEOs
who get rewards without accountability
yeah I mean Telep skin in the game is
required reading if you want to get
anywhere in Modern Life and understand
how modern systems work then a scale of
the game would be near top of my list to
read but yes accountability skin of the
game these concepts go very closely
hand-in-hand
I think of accountability as
reputational skin in the game it's
putting your personal reputation on the
line as skin in the game accountability
is a simple concept the only part of
accountability that may be a little
counterintuitive is that we're currently
socially brainwashed to not take on
accountability not in a visible way but
I think there are ways to take on
accountability where every member of a
team can take on accountability for
their portion and that is how you get a
well-functioning team while still
putting credits and losses in the
correct columns so why don't we talk a
little bit about leverage the first
tweet in the storm was a famous quote
from Archimedes which was give me a
lever long enough and a place to stand
and I will move the earth the next tweet
was fortunes require leverage business
leverage comes from capital people and
products with no marginal costs of
replication leverage is critical the
reason I stuck in Archimedes quote in
there is normally I don't like putting
other people's quotes in my Twitter like
that doesn't add any value you can go
look up those people's quotes but this
court I had to put in there because
it's just so fundamental I read it when
I was very very young and it had a huge
impression on me and we all know what
leverage is when we use a seesaw or a
lever we understand how that works
physically but I think what our brains
aren't really well evolved to comprehend
is how much leverage is possible in
modern society and what the newest forms
of leverage are and so the oldest form
of leverage is labor which is people
working for you so instead of me lifting
rocks I can have 10 people lift rocks
then just by my guidance and where the
rocks should go a lot more rocks get
moved and I could do myself everybody
understands this because we're evolved
to understand the labor a form of
leverage and so what happens is society
overvalues labour as a form of leverage
this is why your parents are impressed
when you get a promotion and you have
lots of people working underneath you
this is why when a lot of naive people
we tell them about your company they'll
say how many people work there they'll
use that as a way to establish
credibility they're trying to measure
how much leverage and impact you
actually have or when someone starts a
movement they'll say how many people
they have or how big the army is we just
automatically assume that more people is
better but I would argue that this is
the worst form of leverage that you
could possibly use managing other people
is incredibly messy it requires
tremendous leadership skills you're one
short hop from a mutiny or getting eaten
or torn apart by the mob it's incredibly
competed over entire civilizations have
been destroyed over this fight for
example communism Marxism is all about
the battle between capital and labor
that's capital law and that's labor
right so it's a trap so you really want
to stay out of labor based leverage you
want the minimum amount of people
working with you that are going to allow
you to use the other forms of leverage
but HR you are much more interesting the
second type of leverage is capital and
this one's a little less hardwired into
us because large amounts of money moving
around and being saved and being
invested in money markets these are
inventions of human beings the last few
hundred to few thousand years they're
not evolved with us from hundreds of
thousands of years so we understand them
a little bit less well they probably
require more intelligence to use
correctly and the ways in which we use
them keep changing management skills
from a hundred years ago might still
apply to
but investing in the stock market skills
from a hundred years ago probably don't
apply to the same level today so capital
is a trickier form of leverage to you
this poor modern it's the one that
people have used to get fabulously
wealthy in the last century it's
probably been the dominant form of
leverage in the last century and you can
see this by who are the richest people
it's bankers politicians and corrupt
countries who print money especially
people who move large amounts of money
around and if you look at the top of
very large companies outside of
technology companies in many many large
old companies the CEO job is really a
financial job they're really financial
asset managers now sometimes an asset
measuring can put a pleasant face on it
so you get a Warren Buffett type but
deep down I think we all dislike capital
as a form of leverage because it feels
unfair because it's this invisible thing
that can be accumulated and passed
across generations and suddenly seems to
result in people having gargantuan
amounts of money with nobody else kind
of around them or Nestle sharing in it
that said Capital is a powerful form of
leverage it can be converted to labor it
can be converted to other things
it's very surgical very analytical if
you are a brilliant investor and give a
billion dollars and you can make a 30
percent return with it where's anybody
else can only make a 20 percent return
you're gonna get all the money and
you're gonna get paid very handsomely
for it it scales very very well if you
get good at managing capital you can
manage more and more capital much more
easy they can manage more and more
people so it is a good form of leverage
but the hard part of capital is how do
you obtain it and that's why I talked
about specific knowledge and
accountability first if you have
specific knowledge in a domain and if
you're accountable and you have a good
name in that domain then people are
going to give you capital as a form of
leverage that you can use to then go get
more capital so but capital also is
fairly well understood and I think a lot
of the knocks against capitalism come
because of the accumulation of capital
the most interesting and the most
important form of leverage is this idea
of products that have no marginal cost
of replication this is the new form of
leverage this was only invented in the
last few hundred years it got started
with the printing press and accelerated
broadcast media and now it's really
blown up with the internet with code so
now you can multiply you
or efforts without having to involve
other humans and without needing money
from other humans this podcast is a form
of leverage long ago I would have had to
sit in a lecture hall and lecture each
of you personally and I would have maybe
reached a few hundred people and that
would have been that 30 years ago I
would have to be lucky to get on TV
which is somebody else's leverage they
would have distorted the message that
would taken the economics out of it or
charged me for it they would have
muddled the message and I would have
been lucky to get that form of leverage
but today thanks to the internet I can
buy a cheap microphone hook it up to a
laptop or an iPad and there you are all
listening
so this newest form of leverage is where
all the new fortunes were made so all
the new billionaires the last generation
fortunes were made by capital that was a
warren buffett's of the world but the
new generation fortunes are all made
through code or media Joe Rogan making
50 to 100 million bucks a year from his
podcast PewDiePie I don't know how much
money he's rolling in but he's bigger
than the news right the fortnight
players of course Jeff Bezos and Mark
Zuckerberg and Larry Page and Sergey
Brin and Bill Gates and Steve Jobs that
is all code based leverage now the
beauty is when you combine all of these
three that's where tech startups really
excel where you take just the minimum
but highest output labor that you can
get which are engineers and designers
product developers and then you add in
capital
use that for marketing advertising
scaling and you add in lots of code and
media and podcasts and content to get it
all out there that is a magic
combination and that's why you see
technology startups explode out of
nowhere use massive leverage and just
make huge outside returns do you want to
talk a little bit about permissioned
versus permissionless probably the most
interesting thing to keep in mind about
the new forms of leverage is their
permission less they don't require
somebody else's permission for you to
use them or succeed for labor leverage
somebody has to decide to follow you for
capital leverage somebody has to give
you money to invest or to turn into a
product but coding writing books
recording podcasts tweeting youtubing
these kinds of things these are
permissionless you don't need anyone's
permission to do them and that's why
they're very
terian they're great equalizers of
leverage and as much as people may rail
on Facebook and YouTube they're not
gonna stop using it because this
permissionless leverage where everyone
can be a broadcaster it's just too good
the same way you know you can rail upon
Apple for having a slightly closed
ecosystem in the iPhone but everyone's
writing apps for it and so as long as
you can write apps for it you can get
rich or reach users doing that why not I
think of all the forms of leverage the
best one in modern society and people
gonna this is glib this is a little
overused but and this is why I tell
people learn to code right it's that we
have this idea that in the future
there's gonna be these robots and
they're gonna be doing everything and
that may be true but I would say the
majority the robot revolution has
already happened the robots are already
here and there are way more robots than
they're humans it's just that we packed
them in data centers for heat and
efficiency reasons we put them in
servers they're inside the computers all
the circuits it's a robot mind inside
that's doing all the work and so every
great software developer for example now
has an army of robots working for him at
nighttime while he or she sleeps after
they've written the code and it's just
cranking away so the robots army is
already here the robot revolution has
already happened we're about halfway
through it we're just adding in much
more of the hardware component these
days as we get more familiar we get more
comfortable with the idea of autonomous
vehicles and autonomous airplanes an
autonomous ships and maybe autonomous
trucks and you know their delivery BOTS
and Boston Dynamics robots and all that
but robots who are doing web searching
for you for example are already here you
know the ones who are like cleaning up
your video and audio and transmitting it
around the world are already here the
ones who are answering many customer
service queries things that you would
have had to call human for are already
here so an army of robots is already
here it's very cheaply available and the
bottleneck is just figuring out
intelligent and interesting things to do
to them and essentially you can order
this army of robots around just the
commands have to be issued in a computer
language in the language that they
understand so these robots aren't very
smart they have to be told very
precisely what to do and how to do it so
coding is such a great superpower
because now you can speak the language
of the robot armies and you can tell
them what to do and I think at this
point actually people are not only
commanding the arm
robots within servers through code
they're actually manipulating the
movement of trucks of other people just
ordering a package on Amazon you're
manipulating the movement of many people
and many robots they get a package
delivered to you people are doing the
same things to build businesses now so
there's the army of robots within
servers and then there's also an army of
actual robots and people that are being
manipulated through software labor and
capital are much less egalitarian not
just in their inputs but in their
outputs let's say that I need something
that humans have to provide like if I
want a massage or if I need like someone
to cook my food the more of a human
element there is in providing that
service the less egalitarian it is Jeff
Bezos probably has much better vacations
and most of us right because he has lots
of humans running around doing whatever
he needs to do but if you look at the
output of code in media Jeff Bezos
doesn't get to watch better movies and
TV than we do Jeff Bezos doesn't get to
even have a better computing experience
like Google doesn't give him some
premium special Google account where his
searches are better it's the nature of
code and media output that the same
product is accessible to everybody and
it turned into a positive sum game where
if Jeff Bezos is consuming the same
product as a thousand other people that
products would be better than the
version that Jeff would consume on his
own whereas with other products that's
not true
if you look at something like buying a
Rolex which is no longer about telling
time it's a signalling good it's all
about showing off I have a Rolex
that's a zero-sum game if everybody in
the world is wearing a Rolex then people
don't want to wear Rolex is anymore
because they're no longer signal it's
canceled out the effect and so rich
people do have an advantage in consuming
that product they'll just price it up
till only they can have Rolexes and then
poor people can have relaxes and relaxes
resume they're signalling value but
something like watching Netflix or using
Google or using Facebook or YouTube or
even frankly modern-day cars like rich
people don't have better cars they just
have weirder cars you can't drive a
Lamborghini on the street at any speed
that makes sense for a Lamborghini so
it's actually a worse car in the street
it just turned into a signaling good at
that point your sweet spot where you
want to be is somewhere like a Tesla
Model 3 or like
Carola is an amazing car a new Toyota
Corolla is a really nice car but because
it's mainstream the technology has
amortized the cost of production over
the largest number of consumers possible
and the best products tend to be at the
center at the sweet spot the
middle-class rather than being targeted
at the upper-class
so I think one of the things that we
don't necessarily is as the forms of
leverage have gone from being human
based labour based and being capital
based to being more product in code and
media base that most of the goods and
services that we consume are becoming
much more egalitarian in their
consumption even food is becoming that
way like food is becoming cheap and
abundant at least in the first world too
much so to our detriment Jeff Bezos
isn't Nestle eating better of food he's
just eating different food or he's
eating like food that's prepared and
served fee at Wrigley so it's almost
like more again that human element
performance but the labor element out of
food production has gone down massively
the capital element has gone down
massively and so even food production
itself has become more technology
oriented and so the gap between the
haves and the have-nots is getting
smaller so if you care about ethics in
wealth creation it is better to create
your wealth using code and media as
leverage because then those products are
equally available to everybody as
opposed to trying to create your wealth
through labor or capital because what
I'm referring to here is scale economies
technology products and media products
have such amazing scale economies that
you always want to use the product that
is used by the most people the one
that's used by the most people ends up
having the largest budget there's no
marginal cost of adding another user and
so with the largest budget you get the
highest quality so the best TV shows are
actually not gonna be some obscure ones
just made for a few rich people they're
gonna be the big budget ones like the
game of thrones with the Breaking Bad or
bird box where they have massive massive
budgets they can just use those budgets
to get to a certain quality level and
then the rich people to be different
they have to fly to Sundance and watch a
documentary because you and I aren't
gonna fly the Sundance because you know
that's something that bored rich people
do to show off and we're not gonna watch
a documentary because Muslims aren't
actually even that good right again if
you're wealthy today for large classes
of things
you spend your money on signaling goods
to show other people that you're wealthy
and you try and convert them to status
as opposed to actually consuming the
goods for their own sake people and
capital as a form of leverage have a
negative externality and code and
product have a positive externality
attached to them if I was going to sum
up your point I think that capital and
labor are also starting to become a
little more permissionless or at least
the permissioning is diffuse because of
the internet so instead of labour we
have community now which is diffused
form of labour for example Mark
Zuckerberg has a billion people doing
work for him by using Facebook and
instead of going to raise capital from
someone who's rich now we have
crowdfunding so you can raise millions
and millions of dollars for a charity
for a health problem or for a business
you can do it all online so capital and
labor are also becoming permissionless
and you don't need to necessarily do it
the old-fashioned way where you have to
go around and ask people for permission
to use their money or their time one
more question about leverage do you
think a choice of business model or our
choice of product can also bring a kind
of leverage to it for example pursuing a
business that has Network effects
pursuing a business that has brand
effects or other choices of business
model that people could manipulate that
just give you free leverage yeah there's
some really good micro economic concepts
that are important to understand one of
those are scale economies which is the
more you produce is something the
cheaper it gets to make it that's
something that a lot of businesses have
basic economics 101 and you should try
and get into a business we're making
widget number 12 is cheaper than making
widget number 5 and making widget number
10,000 is a lot cheaper than the
previous ones and this builds up an
automatic sort of barrier to entry
against competition and getting
commoditized so that's an important one
another one this is along the same lines
but technology products especially and
media products have this great quality
where they have zero marginal cost of
reproduction so creating another copy
what you just created is free so when
somebody listens this podcast or watches
a YouTube video up
this it doesn't cost me anything but the
next person who shows up those zero
marginal cost things they take a while
to get going because you make very
little money per user but over time they
can really really add up so Joe Rogan is
working no harder on his current podcast
and he wasn't podcast number one but on
podcast number 1100 he's making a
million dollars for the podcast where's
for the previous one he probably lost
money for the first one that's an
example of zero marginal cost and then
the most subtle but the most important
is this idea of network effects and it
comes from computer networking Bob
Metcalfe who created Ethernet famously
coined Metcalfe's law which is the value
of a network is proportional to the
square of the number of nodes in the
network so if network of size 10 would
have a value of a hundred network of a
size 100 would have a value of 10,000
it's not just 10x more it's a hundred X
more because a square so the difference
is the square so you want to be in a
network effects business assuming you're
not number two if you're number one in
network effect business you win
everything so example if you look at
Facebook right your friends and family
social networking protocol who's your
competitor nobody because they want
everything through network effects which
is why when people say well I can just
switch away from Facebook they don't
realize that network effects create
natural monopolies they're very very
powerful things and one of the dirty
secrets of Silicon Valley is that a lot
of the winning businesses are natural
monopolies even dried sharing tends
towards one winner-take-all system like
uber will always have better economics
and lyft as long as it's moving more
drivers and more writers around
something like Google there's the only
one Bible search engine I do like
DuckDuckGo you know privacy reasons but
they're just always gonna be behind
because of network effects twitter right
where else would you go for micro
blogging even YouTube has a weak network
effects but they're still powerful
enough there's really no number-two site
that you go to to consume your video on
a regular basis it even turns out in
detail Amazon Prime and convenience
store credit cards and information
creates a powerful network effect so
what is the network effect let's define
it precisely a network effect is when
each additional user adds value to the
existing user base so your users
themselves are creating some value for
the existing
users the classic example that I think
everybody can understand is language
let's say that there's a hundred people
live in the community and speak ten
different languages and each person just
speaks one of those ten well you're
having to translate all the time it's
incredibly painful but if all hundred of
you spoke the same language it would add
tremendous value and so the way that
community will play out is ten people
start out speaking ten languages let's
say that one extra person limbs English
well now all of a sudden eleven people
know English so that the next person
comes in to learn new language probably
gonna choose English at some point let's
say English gets a twenty or twenty-five
people it's done it's just gonna own the
entire language marketplace and the rest
of the languages will get competed out
which is why long term the entire world
is probably gonna end up speaking
English in Chinese China is closed off
on the internet but the Internet itself
is a great leveler and people who want
to communicate on the Internet are
forced to speak English because the
largest community of people on the
Internet speaks English I always feel
bad for my colleagues who grew up
speaking foreign languages in foreign
countries because you don't have access
to so many books so many books just
haven't been translated into other
languages so if you only spoke French or
you only spoke German or you only spoke
Hindi for example you would be at a
severe disadvantage in a technical
education invariably if you go and get a
technical education you have to learn
English just because you have to read
these books that have this data that has
not been translated so languages are
probably the oldest example of network
effect money is another example we
should all probably be using the same
money except for the fact that
Geographic and regulatory boundaries
have created these artificial islands of
money but even then the world tends to
use a single currency as the reserve
currency at most times currently the US
dollar so network affects a very
powerful concept when you're picking a
business model it's really good idea to
pick a model where you can benefit from
network effects low marginal costs and
scale economies and these tend to go
together like anything that has zero
marginal cost of production obviously
has scale economies and things that have
zero marginal cost every productions
very often tend to have Network effects
because it doesn't cost you anything
more to stamp out the thing so then you
can just create little hooks for users
to add value to each other you should
always be thinking about how your users
your customers
can add value to each other because that
is the ultimate form of leverage you're
in the beach of the Bahamas or you're
sleeping at night and your customers are
adding value to each other
tweet storm is very abstract it's
deliberately meant to be broadly
applicable to all kinds of different
domains and disciplines and time periods
and places but sometimes it's hard to
work without concrete example so let's
just go concrete for a minute look at
the real estate business you could start
at the bottom let's say you're a day
laborer you come in you fix people's
houses someone orders you around tells
you break that piece of rock send that
piece of wood put that thing over there
there's all these menial jobs that go on
in a construction site
if you're working one of those jobs
unless you're a skilled trade like say a
carpenter or electrician you don't
really have specific knowledge and even
carpenter electrician is not that
specific because other people can be
trained how to do it so you can be
replaced so you get paid your fifteen
twenty twenty-five fifty if you're
really lucky 75 dollars an hour but
that's about it you don't have any
leverage other than from the tools that
you're using so if you're driving a
bulldozer that's better than doing it
with your hands so daily labor in India
makes a lot less because they have no
tool leverage you don't have much
accountability you're a faceless cog and
the construction crew and the owner of
the house or the buyer the house doesn't
know or care that you worked on it one
step up from that you might have a
contractor like a general contractor who
someone hires to come and fix and repair
and build up their house that general
contractor is taking accountability
they're taking responsibility so now if
let's say they got paid two and fifty
thousand dollars for a job so I'm using
barrier prices so go arrest the world
price $100,000 for the job to fix up a
house and it actually cost the general
contractor all said and done $70,000
well that contractors gonna pocket that
remaining thirty so they got the upside
they got the equity but they're also
taking accountability and risk so if the
project runs over and there's losses
then they eat the losses but you see be
just the accountability gives them some
form of additional potential income and
then they also have labor leverage
because they have a bunch of people
working for them but it probably tops
out right there you can go one level
above that and you can look at a
property developer this might be someone
who is a contractor who did a bunch of
houses did a really good job then
decided to go into business for
themselves and they go around looking
for beaten down properties that have
potential they buy them they either
raise money from investors they're
fronted themselves they fix the place up
and
they sell it for twice what they bought
it for maybe they only put in 20% more
so it's a healthy profit so now a
developer like that takes on more
accountability has more risk they're
more specific knowledge because now you
have to know which neighborhoods are
worth buying in which Lots
are actually good and which Lots are bad
what makes or breaks a specific property
you have to imagine the finished house
that's gonna be there even when the
property itself might look really bad
right now so there's more specific
knowledge there's more accountability
and risk and now you also have capital
leverage because you're also putting
money into the project but conceivably
you could buy you know a piece of land
or a broken-down house for $200,000 and
turn it into a million-dollar mansion
and pocket all the difference one level
beyond that might be a famous architect
or a developer we're just having your
name on a property because you've done
so many great properties increases its
value one level up from that you might
be a person who decides well I
understand real estate and I now know
enough of the dynamics of real estate
that rather than just build and flip my
own properties or improve my own
properties I'm gonna be a massive
developer I'm gonna build entire
communities another person might say I
like that leverage but I don't want to
manage all these people I want to do it
more through capital so I'm gonna start
a real estate investment trust and that
requires specific knowledge not just
about investing in real estate and
building real estate but also requires
specific knowledge about the financial
markets and the capital markets and how
real estate trusts operate one level
beyond that might be somebody who says
actually I want to bring the maximum
leverage to bear in this market and the
maximum specific knowledge and so that
person would say well I understand real
estate and I understand everything from
basic housing construction to building
properties and selling them to how real
estate markets move and thrive and I
also understand the technology business
so I understand how to recruit
developers how to write code and how to
build that product and I understand how
to raise money from venture capitalists
and how to return it now what that works
and obviously not a single person may
know this you may pull a team together
to do it where each have different skill
sets but that combined entity would have
specific knowledge in technology and in
real estate it would have massive
accountability because that company's
name would be a very high risk high
reward effort attached to the whole
thing and people would devote their
lives to it
take on significant risk
and then it would have leverage in code
with lots of developers it would have
capital with investors putting money and
and the founders own capital and it
would have labor of some of the highest
quality labor that you can find which is
high quality engineers and designers and
marketers who are working on the company
and then you may end up with a Trulia or
a read fan or Zillow kind of company and
then the upside could potentially be in
the billions of dollars or the hundreds
of millions of dollars so as you layer
in more and more kinds of knowledge that
can only be gained on the job and aren't
common knowledge and you layer in more
and more accountability and risk-taking
and you layer in more and more great
people working on it and more and more
capital on it and more and more code and
media on it you keep expanding the scope
of the opportunity all the way from the
day laborer who might just literally be
scrapping on the ground with their hands
all the way up to somebody who started a
real estate tech company and then took
it public we spoke about specific
knowledge we talked about accountability
we talked about leverage the last skill
that navall talks about in his tweet
storm is judgment where he says that
leverage is a force multiplier for your
judgment we are now living in an age of
nearly infinite leverage and all the
great fortunes are created through
leverage so your first job is to go and
obtain leverage and you can obtain
leverage through permission by taking
risks and getting people to work for you
or by raising capital or you can get
leverage permissionless lee by learning
how to code or becoming good
communicator and podcasting and
broadcasting creating videos writing etc
so that's how you get leverage but once
you have leverage what do you do with it
well the first part a career spent
hustling to get leverage once you have
the leverage then you want to slow down
a bit
because your judgment really matters
it's like you've gone from steering your
sailboat around to now you're steering
an ocean liner or a tanker you have a
lot more at risk but you have a lot more
to gain as well you're carrying a much
higher payload so in an age of infinite
leverage judgment becomes the most
important skill Warren Buffett is so
wealthy now because of his judgment even
if you were to take away all of Warren's
money tomorrow investors would come out
of the woodwork and hand him 100 billion
dollars because they know his judgment
is so good
they would give him a big chunk of that
hundred billion dollars to invest so
ultimately everything else that you do
is actually setting you up to apply your
judgment one of the big things that
people rail on a CEO pay and for sure
there's crony capitalism that goes on
where these CEOs control their boards
and the boards give them too much money
but there are certain CEOs who
definitely earn their keep because their
judgment is better if you're steering a
big ship if you're steering Google or
Apple and your judgment is 10 or 20
percent better than the next person's
Society will literally pay you hundreds
of millions of dollars more because
you're steering a hundred billion dollar
ship if you're on course ten or twenty
percent of the time more often the other
person the compounding results on that
hundreds of billions of dollars you're
managing will be so large that your CEO
pay will be dwarfed in comparison so
demonstrated judgment credibility around
the judgment is so critical Warren
Buffett wins here because he has massive
credibility he's been highly accountable
he's been right over and over in the
public domain he's built a reputation
for very high integrity so you can trust
him so a person like that people will
throw infinite leverage behind him
because of his judgment nobody asked him
how hard he works nobody asked him when
he wakes up or when he goes to sleep did
like Warren just do your thing
so especially demonstrated judgment with
high accountability clear track record
is critical let's define judgment I
would define it as knowing the long-term
effects of your decisions or being able
to predict the long-term affects your
decisions it's funny my definition of
wisdom is knowing the long-term
consequences of your actions they're not
all that different wisdom is just
judgment on a personal domain wisdom
applied to external problems I think is
judgment so they're they're highly
linked but yes it's knowing the
long-term consequences of your actions
and then making kind of the right
decision to capitalize on that judgment
is very hard to build up this is where
both intellect and experience come into
play there are many problems with the
so-called
intellectuals in the ivory tower but one
of the reasons why I must seem tell them
rails against them is because they have
no skin in the game they have no
real-world experience right so they just
apply purely into
and intellect without any experience is
often worse than useless because you get
the confidence that the intellect gives
you and you get some of the credibility
but because you had no skin in the game
and you had no real experience and no
real accountability you're just throwing
darts the real world is always far far
more complex than we can intellectualize
and especially all the interesting
fast-moving edge domains and problems
you can't get there without experience
so if you are smart and you iterate fast
it's not even you put 10,000 hours into
something but you take 10,000 tries at
something if you are smart and you have
a lot of quick iterations and you try to
keep your emotions out of it
the people with the best judgement are
actually among the least emotional a lot
of the best investors are considered
almost robotic in that regard but I
would be surprised if even the best
entrepreneurs often come across as
unemotional there is this archetype of
the passionate entrepreneur and yeah
they have to care about what they're
doing but they also have to see very
clearly what's actually happening and
the thing that prevents you from seeing
what's actually happening or your
emotions our emotions are constantly
clouding our judgment and investing or
in running companies or in building
products or being entrepreneur emotions
really get in the way
emotions that were preventing you from
seeing what's actually happening until
you can no longer resist the truth of
what's happening until it becomes too
sudden and then you're forced into
suffering which is a breaking of this
emotional fantasy that you would put
together to try and connect some of
these concepts I would say that first
you're accountable for your judgement
judgment is the exercise of wisdom
wisdom comes from experience and that
experience can be accelerated through
short iterations and the reason why a
lot of the top investors a lot of the
value investors if you read Jeremy
Grantham where you read Warren Buffett
you know you read up on Michael burry
these people sound like philosophers or
they are philosophers or they're reading
a lot of history books or science books
like what are they doing shouldn't they
be reading investment books no
investment books or the worst place to
learn about investment because
investment is a real-world activity that
is highly multivariate all the
advantages are always being competed
away it's always in the cutting edge
what you actually just need is very very
broad-based judgment and thinking and
the best way to do that is to study
everything including a lot of philosophy
and philosophy also makes you more stoic
makes you less emotional and so you make
better decisions you have better
judgment one simple thing is I see that
go ahead on Twitter and it seems like
half of Twitter is outrageous something
at all times
you can go within someone's Twitter feed
and get at least some semblance of what
it must be like to be in their head all
the time and the more outrage somebody
is I guarantee you the worse their
judgment is if someone's constantly
tweeting political outrage and it seems
like an angry person getting into fights
you don't want to hand these person the
keys to your car let alone the keys to
your company so we covered the skills
that you need to get rich that was
specific knowledge accountability
leverage judgment and lifelong learning
let's talk a little bit about the
importance of working hard and valuing
your time so no one is going to value
you more than you value yourself so you
just have to set a very high personal
hourly rate and you have to stick to it
so even since when I was young I just
decided that I was worth a lot more than
the market thought I was worth but I
started treating myself that way so
always factor your time into every
decision how much time does it take oh
it's gonna take me an hour to get across
town to get this thing well I value
myself at $100 an hour that's throwing
hundred dollars out of my pocket am I
gonna do that
you buy something from Amazon they
screwed it up you have to return it is
it worth your time to return it is it
worth the mental hassle keep in mind
that you have less work hours you have
less mentally high-output hours do you
want to use them to run errands and
solve little problems or do you want to
save them for the big stuff all the
great scientists were terrible at
managing their household life none of
them had a clean organized room or you
know made all their social events on
time or sent their thank-you cards you
can spend your life however you want but
if you want to get rich it has to be
your number one overwhelming desire
which means that it has to come before
anything else which means you can't be
penny-pinching this is what people
understand you can penny pinch your way
to the basic sustenance you can keep
your expenses low maybe retire early and
not spend too
that's perfectly valid but we're here to
talk about wealth creation and if you're
gonna do that then that has to be your
number one overwhelming priority so
fast-forward to your wealthy self and
pick some intermediate hourly rate for
me believe it or not back when you could
have hired me which now obviously can't
but back when you could have hired me
and this was true a decade ago or even
two decades ago before I had any real
money my hourly rate I used to say to
myself over and over is $5,000 an hour
today and when I look back really it was
about $1,000 an hour and of course I
still ended up doing stupid things like
arguing with the electrician or
returning the broken speaker but I
shouldn't have and I did a lot less than
any of my friends would and I would make
a theatrical show out of throwing
something in the trash pile or giving to
Salvation Army rather than trying to
return it or handing something to people
rather than trying to fix it I would
argue with my girlfriends and even today
to my wife like I don't do that that's
not a problem that I solve I still
argued that with my mother when she
hands me like little to do's I just
don't do that I would rather hire you an
assistant and this was true even when I
didn't have money another way of
thinking about something is if you can
outsource something or not do something
for less than your hourly rate outsource
it or don't do it so if you can hire
someone to do it for less than your
hourly rate hire them that even includes
things like cooking now if you may want
to eat your healthy home-cooked meals
but if you can outsource it do that
instead and I know some people will say
well what about the joy of life and what
about getting it right just your way
sure you can do that but you're not
gonna be wealthy because now you've made
something else a priority Paul Graham
said it pretty well for Y Combinator
startups you said you should be working
on your product and getting product
market fit and you should be exercising
and eating healthy like that's about it
that's kind of all you have time for
while you're on this mission so set a
very high hourly aspirational rate for
yourself and stick to it and it should
seem and feel absurdly high if it
doesn't it's not high enough and
whatever you picked on my advice to you
would be raise it like I said for myself
even before I had money for the longest
time I use five thousand dollars an hour
and if you extrapolate that out into
what it looks like his annual salary its
multiple millions of dollars per year
ironically I actually think I've beaten
it but I look back because I'm not the
hardest-working person I'm actually kind
of a lazy person so I worked through
bursts of energy where I'm really
motivated with something so if I
actually look at how much I've earned
per actual hour that I put in is
probably quite a bit higher than that
let's talk about hard work there's this
battle that happens in Twitter a lot
between should you work hard and should
you not like David Hauser's on there
saying it's like your slave driving
people and Keith Robo is always on there
saying like know all the great founders
work their fingers to the bone and
they're talking past each other first of
all they're talking about two different
things David is talking about employees
in a lifestyle business which is fine
your number one thing in life if you're
doing that is not getting wealthy you
have a job you also have your family you
also have your life but Keith is talking
about the Olympics of startups he's
talking about the person going for the
gold medal and trying to build a
multi-billion dollar public company that
person has to get everything right they
have to have great judgment they have to
pick the right thing to work on they
have to recruit the right team and they
have to work crazy hard because they're
basically engaged in a competitive
sprint so if getting wealthy is your
goal you are going to have to work as
hard as you can but hard work is
absolutely no substitute for who you
work with and what you work on what you
work on is probably the most important
thing finding product market founder fit
to expand on Marc Andreessen definition
he came with product market fit but I
would add product market founder fit
which is how well you are personally
suited to that business the combination
that three that should be your
overwhelming goal and you can save
yourself a lot of time if you pick the
right area to work in picking the right
people to work with is the next most
important piece and then third comes how
hard you work but they're like three
legs of a stool if you shortchange in
any one of them the whole stool is gonna
fall down so it's not like you can pick
one over the other that easily so the
order operations when you're building a
business is or even building your career
is first figure out what should I be
doing what is something where there is a
market that is emerging there's a
product that I can build that I'm
excited to work on and something where I
have specific knowledge and I'm really
into it and then second surround
yourself with the best people possible
and no matter how high your bar is raise
your bar because you can never be
working with other people who are great
enough if there's someone greater out
there to work with you should go work
with them I advise a lot of people who
are looking at which started to join in
Silicon Valley I say basically pick the
one that's going to have the best alumni
network for you in the future look at
the PayPal mafia
they work with a bunch of geniuses so
they all got rich so just try and pick
based on the highest intelligence
energy and integrity people that you can
find and then finally once you have
picked the right thing to work on and
the right people to work with then you
work as hard as you can this is where
the mythology gets a little crazy people
will work 1820 hour weeks a lot of
that's just status signaling it's
showing off
nobody really works 80 200 20 hours a
week sustained at high output with
mental clarity your brain breaks down
you just won't have good ideas so really
the way people tend to work most
effectively especially in knowledge work
is they sprint as hard as they can while
they're working on something and they're
inspired and they're passionate and then
they rest to take long breaks it's more
like a lion hunting and much less like a
marathon running and running so you
sprint then you rest you reassess and
then you try again in which you end up
doing is you end up building a marathon
of Sprint's maybe just made the point to
me on the side that inspiration is
perishable which is a very good point
when you have your inspiration do it
right then and there this happens to me
a lot with my tweet storms I've actually
come up with a whole bunch of additional
tweets Donna decides the ones that are
already out there but sometimes I just
hesitate or I just pause and then it
just dies and what I've learned is if
I'm inspired to write a blog post or to
publish a tweet storm I should probably
do it right away otherwise it's not
gonna get out there I won't come back to
it so inspiration is a beautiful and
powerful thing and when you have it just
seize it so people talk about impatience
when do you know to be impatient when
you know to be patient my glib tweet on
this was impatience with actions and
patience with the results and I think
that's actually a good philosophy for
life anything you have to do just get it
done
why wait you're not getting any younger
your life is slipping away you don't
want to spend it waiting in line you
don't want to spend it traveling back
and forth you don't want to spend it
doing things that you know ultimately
aren't part of your mission and when you
do them you want to do them as quickly
as you can while you do them well with
your full attention but then you just
have to give up on the results you have
to be patient with the results because
you deal with complex systems you didn't
with lots of people it takes a long time
for markets to adopt products it takes
time for people to get comfortable
working with each other it takes time
for great products to emerge as you
polish away polish away polish away so
impatience with actions patience with
results and as may be said inspiration
is perishable
so when you have inspiration act on it
right then and there if I have a problem
that I discovered one of my businesses
that needs to be solved I won't sleep
until at least the resolution is in
motion and this is just a personal
failing but if I'm on the board of a
company I'll call the CEO if I'm running
the company I'll call my reports if I'm
responsible I'll get on there right then
and there and solve it if I don't solve
a problem the moment it happens or I
don't start moving toward solving from
when it happens I have no peace
I have no rest I have no happiness until
that problem is solved so solve it as
quickly as possible
I literally won't sleep until it's solve
maybe that's a personal characteristic
but it's worked out well in business we
squander our time with a death of a
thousand cuts
so another tweet ahead was you should be
too busy to do coffee while still
keeping an uncluttered calendar people
who know me know that I'm famous for
simultaneously doing two things one is
having a very clean calendar I have
almost no meetings on it and there are
people that I meet with when they see my
calendar they almost weep well at the
same time I am busy all the time I'm
always doing something and it's usually
quote unquote work-related but it is
whatever the highest impact thing is
that needs to be done at that time and
that I'm most interested inspired about
but the only way to do that is to
constantly ruthlessly decline meetings
people want to do coffee and build
relationships and that's fine early in
your career when you're still exploring
but later in your career were exploiting
and there are more things coming at you
and you have time for you have to
ruthlessly cut meetings out of your life
if someone wants to do a meeting see if
you can do it with a phone call instead
if they want to do a phone call see if
they can do it with an email instead if
they want to do it email see if they can
do it a text message instead if their
text messaging you should probably be
ignoring most text messages unless
they're true emergencies so one has to
be utterly ruthless about dodging
meetings when you do do meetings do
walking meetings do standing meetings
keep them short keep them actionable
keep them small any meeting with eight
people and it's sitting on a conference
table nothing is getting done in that
meeting
you're literally just dying one hour at
a time doing coffee reminds me of an old
quote I think from Steve Jobs when they
asked him hey why does an apple come to
conventions or why don't you come to my
convention and his response was well
then because we wouldn't be here working
yeah I used to
have a tough time turning people down
for meetings but now I just tell them
outright I just say look I don't do
non-transactional meetings I don't do
meetings without a strict agenda I don't
do meetings unless we absolutely have to
maybe used to do this he would email
people when they would ask maybe and I
for a meeting like coffee meeting it to
know you he would say we don't do
meetings unless is life and death urgent
and then that person has to respond yeah
its life in that origin or there's no
meeting when you have something
important or something valuable other
busy interesting people will meet with
you your calling card has to be hey
here's what I'm done here's what I can
show you let's meet and I'll be
respectful of your time if this is
useful to you
and I find that there are very busy
important people who will take your
meeting but you have to come with a
proper calling card
all the people who tweet and who email
famous or rich people saying hey if I
could just get one meeting with you and
they're vague about it they're not gonna
get anywhere in life you have to build
up the credibility when for example an
investor in the tech business in the
venture business looks at a start-up the
first thing they want to see is they
want to see some evidence of product
progress they don't just want to even
see a slide back they want to see
product progress because the product
progress is the resume for the
entrepreneur it is the unshakable
unfaithful resume so you have to do the
work to use a crypto analogy you have to
have proof of work if you have proof of
work and you truly have something
interesting
then you shouldn't hesitate to put it
together in an email and send it to
somebody but even then when you're
asking for a meeting you want to be
super actionable about it but I would
say even the other side even if you
yourself haven't made it yet if you
think you're gonna make it by going out
and networking and doing a whole bunch
of meetings you're probably incorrect
yes the networking can be important
early in your career and yes you can get
serendipitous with meetings but the odds
are pretty low and as we spent time
talking about earlier when you are just
meeting people and hoping to get that
lucky break you're relying on type 1
luck which is blind luck and type 2 luck
which is hustle luck but what you're not
getting is type 3 or type 4 luck which
are the better kinds where you spend
time developing a reputation working on
something developing a unique point of
view and being able to spot
opportunities that others can a busy
calendar
and a busy mind will destroy your
ability to do great things in this world
if you want to be able to do great
things whether you're a musician or
whether you are a entrepreneur or
whether you're an investor you need free
time and you need a free mind we just
finished talking about the importance of
working hard and valuing your time next
there's a few tweets on the topic of
working for the long term the first
tweet is become the best in the world of
what you do
keep redefining what you do until this
is true if you really want to get paid
in this world you want to be number one
at whatever it is that you're doing and
it can be niche that's the point it can
literally be you're getting paid for
just being you you know at this point
some of the more successful people in
the world are that way
Oprah gets paid for being Oprah Joe
Rogan gets paid for being Joe Rogan and
they're being authentic to themselves so
what this tweet is trying to say
simultaneously is that you want to be
number one but you want to keep changing
what you do until you're number one you
can't just pick something arbitrary you
can't say I'm gonna be the fastest
runner in the world and now you got to
beat the same volt that's too hard of a
problem but what you can do is you can
keep changing what your objective is
until it arrives to your specific
knowledge your skill sets your position
your capabilities your location your
interests and then converges to making
you number one so when you're searching
for what to do you actually have two
different foci that you have to keep in
mind at all points and one of those is I
want to be the best at what I do and the
second is what I do is flexible so that
I am the best at it until you arrive at
a comfortable place we were like yes
this is something I can be amazing at
while still being authentic to who I am
and this is not going to be an overnight
discovery it's gonna be a long journey
but at least you know how to think about
it the most important thing for a
company is to find product market fit I
would say the most important thing for
an entrepreneur is to find founder
product market fit where you are
naturally inclined to build the right
product which has a market and that's a
three focus problem which is you got to
make all three of those work at once if
you want to be successful in life you
just have to get comfortable managing
multivariate problems multiple objective
functions that
and this is one of those cases where you
have to map at least two or three at
once this reminds me of your tweet about
escaping competition through
authenticity it sounds like part of this
is a search for who you are it's both a
search and a recognition because
sometimes when we search our egos we
want to be something that we aren't and
our friends and family are better at
telling us actually who we are or
looking back at what we've done is a
better indicator of who we are Peter
teal talks a lot about how competition
is besides the point it's
counterproductive we're highly mimetic
creatures we copy what everybody else is
doing around us we copy our desires from
them everyone around me is a great
artist I want to be an artist if
everyone around me is a great business
person I want to be a business person
everybody around me as a social
activists I want to be a social activist
that's where my self-esteem will come
from you have to be a little careful
when you get caught up into these status
games that you end up competing over
things that aren't worth competing over
so Peter Thiel talks about how he was
gonna be a law clerk because he was in
law school everybody around him wanted
to be a law clerk for a Supreme Court
justice or some famous judge and he got
rejected and that's what made him go
into business so it helped him break out
of a lesser game into a greater game so
sometimes you just get trapped in the
wrong game because you're competing and
the best way to escape competition to
get away from the specter of competition
which is not just stressful and
nerve-racking but will often drive you
to just the wrong answer the way to
escape competition is to just be
authentic to yourself if you are
fundamentally building and marketing
something that is just an extension of
who you are no one can compete with you
on that
who's gonna compete with Joe Rogan or
Scott Adams it's impossible it's
somebody else gonna come along and write
a better Dilbert no it's someone going
to compete with Bill Watterson and
create a better Calvin and Hobbes no
there being authentic this is easiest to
see in art artists are by definition all
naturally authentic but even
entrepreneurs are authentic who's gonna
be Elon Musk who's gonna be Jack Dorsey
these people are authentic and the
businesses and products they create are
authentic to their desires and their
means if somebody else came along and
started launching rockets I don't think
would phase Elon one bit he's still
gonna get to Mars because that's his
mission
you know insane as it seems
the one he set for himself and he's
gonna accomplish it so authenticity
naturally gets you away from competition
it doesn't mean that you necessarily
want to be authentic to the point where
there's no product market fit it may
turn out you're the best juggler on the
unicycle but maybe there just isn't that
much of a market for that even with
YouTube videos so you gotta adjust that
somehow until you find product market
fit but at least lean towards
authenticity towards getting away from
competition and competition
automatically leads towards copycatting
and often towards just playing
completely the wrong game especially an
entrepreneurship the masses are never
right if you see a lot of people
tweeting about what a great market to
enter is or you see journalists talking
about a company is terrible they don't
know anything if the masses knew how to
build great things and create great
wealth we'd already be done we'd already
be rich by now so in a sense when you
see a lot of competition sometimes that
indicates to you that the masses are
already here so it's already competed
over too much and there's nothing here
or it's in the wrong trend to begin with
on the other hand if it's completely
empty if the whole market is empty and
no one's there that can also be a
warning indicator that you've gone too
authentic and not enough on the product
market fit part of founder product
market fit so there's a balance you have
to find it but generally most people
will make the mistake of paying too much
attention to the competition and being
too much like the competition and not
being authentic enough and the great
founders tend to be authentic
iconoclasts I hate to bring up the scott
adams skill stack one more time but also
bring it up do you think one way of
getting to authenticity is not
necessarily adding some random skills
that you think might be important but
just really finding five or six various
skills that you already authentically do
and just stacking them on top of each
other and not even in any purposeful way
if you are expressing who you are you're
going to be expressing all these little
five or six different skills anyway
that's really where life is going to
lead you anyway long term if you are
good and successful at what you do you
will find that whatever your hobbies
were you're almost doing them for a
living
as Robert Frost said you know combine
your vocation and your avocation what
you love to do and what you do do so I
think you'll find yourself there anyway
and you're right about the skill stack
and that everyone's got multiple skills
we aren't all one-dimensional creatures
even though that's how we have to
portray ourselves and our online
profiles to get employed you meet
somebody and they say I'm a banker or
I'm a bartender or I'm a barber or what
have you all the B's but people are
multivariate they have a lot of skills
one banker might be going to finance
another one might be good at sales the
third one might be just good at
macroeconomic trends and have a feel for
the markets another one might be really
good at picking individual stocks you
know another one might just be good at
maintaining relationships rather than
selling new relationships so everyone's
gonna have their various niches and
you're gonna have multiple niche it's
not gonna be just one so over time you
will find as you go through your career
both you will gravitate towards the
things that you're good at which by
definition are almost the things you
enjoyed doing otherwise you wouldn't be
good at them you wouldn't have put in
the time and other people will push you
towards the things that you're good at
because you're smart bosses and you're
smart coworkers and you're smart
investors will realize okay you're
really world class and this thing we can
recruit somebody else for that other
thing so ideally you want to end up
specializing in being you I think when
you're being authentic you don't really
mind competition that much yeah it
pisses you off and it inspires some fear
and jealousy and all the other emotions
that come along with it but also you
don't really mind because you're more
oriented towards the goal and the
mission and worst case you get some
ideas from them and there's often ways
to work with the competition in a
positive way
and it ends up increasing the size of
the market for you yeah sometimes it
depends on the nature of the business
Silicon Valley tech industry businesses
tend to be winner-take-all at least the
good ones and so when you see
competition it can make you fly into a
rage because it really does endanger
everything you've built whereas if I was
opening a restaurant and a more
interesting version the same restaurant
opens up in a different town that's
fantastic I'm just gonna lift from them
what's working and drop what I can see
that they have already figured out is
not working so it does depend to some
extent on the nature of the business
that said even the businesses that seem
like that they are often in direct
competition
and really aren't they can end up
adjacent or slightly different you're
one step away from a completely
different business and sometimes you
need to take that one step and you're
not gonna be able to take it if you're
busy fighting over a booby prize kind of
you're playing a stupid game gonna win a
stupid prize it's not obvious right now
because you're blinded by competition
but three years from now it'll be
obvious to give a simple example when I
was first starting companies one of my
first ones was called opinions which was
an online product review site for all
the products out there that was
independent of Amazon and that space
eventually turned into TripAdvisor and
Yelp which is where we should have gone
we should have done more local reviews
because there's more value to having a
review of a scarce item like in your
local restaurant there is of an item
like a camera which was gonna have a
thousand reviews on Amazon but before we
could get there we got caught up in the
whole comparison shopping game and so we
ended up merging with deal time and we
competed with my Simon and biz raid
which became Shopzilla and PriceGrabber
and next tag and a whole bunch of these
price comparison engines and we're all
caught and fierce competition with each
other and that whole space went to zero
because it turns out Amazon 1e tail
completely so there was no need for
price comparison everyone just went to
Amazon but we got the booby prize
because we were caught in a competition
with a bunch of our peers when really we
should have been looking at what the
consumer really wanted and being
authentic to ourselves which was reviews
in that price comparison and gone more
and more into more and more esoteric
items that needed to be reviewed where
customers had less and less data and
wanted reviews more badly so if we'd
stayed authentic to ourselves we would
have done better we're still talking
about working for the long-term the next
tweet on that topic is apply specific
knowledge with leverage and eventually
you will get what you deserve I would
also add to that apply judgment apply
accountability and apply the skill of
reading this one is just a glib way of
saying that it takes time even once you
have all of these pieces in place there
is an indeterminate amount of time that
you're gonna have to put in and if
you're counting you will run out of
patience before it actually arrives so
you just have to make sure that you give
these things a proper time life is long
Charlie Munger had some line on this
somebody asked him about me
him money and he reinterpreted that and
he said what the questioner is actually
asking is how do I get rich like you but
faster before I end up as an really old
guy and everybody wants it immediately
but the world is an efficient place
immediate doesn't work you do have to
put in the time you do if you put in the
hours and so I think you just have to
put yourself in the position with the
specific knowledge with the
accountability with the leverage with
the authentic skillset that you have to
be the best in the world at what you do
and then you have to enjoy it and just
keep doing it and keep doing it and keep
doing it and don't keep track and don't
keep count because if you do you will
run out of time I can look back at my
career and the people two decades ago
that I had identified as brilliant and
hard-working but hadn't thought much
more about it they're all successful now
almost without exception on a long
enough time scale you do get paid but it
can easily be 10 or 20 years sometimes
it's five and if it's five or three and
a friend of yours got there it can drive
you insane
but those are exceptions and for every
winner there's multiple failures one
thing that's important in
entrepreneurship is you just have to be
right once you get many many shots on
goal you can take a shot on goal every
three to five years maybe every ten at
the slowest or once every year at the
fastest depending on how you're
iterating with startups but you really
only have to be right once my little
equation is that your eventual outcome
will be equal to something like the
distinctiveness of your specific
knowledge times how much leverage you
can apply to that knowledge times how
often your judgment is correct
times how singularly accountable you are
for the outcome times how much society
values what you're doing and then you
compound all of that with how long you
can keep doing it and how long you can
keep improving it through reading and
learning that's actually a really good
way to summarize it it's probably worth
even trying to sketch that equation out
that said people try to then apply
mathematics it was really philosophy so
I've seen this happen in the past where
I say one thing and then I say another
thing that seemed contradictory if you
treat as a math equation but it's
obviously in different context and then
people will say well you say that desire
is suffering that's the Buddhist saying
and then you say that all greatness
comes
suffering so does that mean all
greatness comes from desire and cycle
this isn't math people he can't just
start carrying variables around and
forming absolute logical outputs you
have to know when to apply things so I
think that is very useful to understand
but at the same time one can't get too
analytical about it
it's what a physicist would call false
precision when you take two made-up
estimates and you multiply them together
and you get four degrees of precision
those decimal points don't actually
count you don't have that data you don't
have that knowledge in a model the more
estimated variables you have the greater
the error in the model so just adding
more and more complexity to your
decision-making process actually gets
you a worse answer you're better off
just picking the single biggest thing or
two for example what am I really good at
according to observation and according
to people that I trust that the market
values like that alone those two
variables alone are probably good enough
because if you're good at it you'll keep
it up and if you're good at it you
develop the judgment and if you're good
at it and you like to do it eventually
people will give you the resources and
you won't be afraid to take on
accountability so all the other pieces
will fall in place product market fit is
inevitable if you're doing something you
love to do and the market wants it
regarding the guy that gets rich in five
years one of the tweets that you had on
the cutting room floor was avoid people
who got rich quickly they're just giving
you their winning lottery ticket numbers
this is generally true of advice anyway
which is it's back to Scott Adams
systems not goals if you ask a specific
person what worked for them very often
it's just like they're reading out the
exact set of things that work for them
which may not be applicable for you
they're just reading your winning
lottery ticket numbers it's a little
glib there is something to be learned
from them but you can't just take their
exact circumstance and map it onto yours
the best founders I know they listen and
read to everyone but then they ignore
everybody and they make up their own
mind they have their own internal model
of how to apply things to their
situation and they do not hesitate to
discard information if you survey enough
people all the advice will cancel a zero
so you do have to have your own point of
view
and when something is sent your way you
have to very quickly decide is that true
is that true outside of the context of
what that person applied it in is it
true in my context and then do I want to
apply it you have to reject most advice
but you have to listen to and read
enough of it to know what to reject and
what to accept even in this podcast you
should examine everything if something
does not feel true to you put it down
set it aside if too many things seem
untrue delete this podcast I think the
most dangerous part of taking advice is
that the person that gave it to you is
not going to be around to tell you when
it doesn't apply any longer yet I view
the purpose of advice as a little
different than most people I just view
it as helping me have anecdotes and
Maxim's that I can then later recall
when I have my own direct experience and
say ah that's what that person meant 90%
of my tweets are actually just Maxim's
that I carve for myself there are then
little mental hooks to remind me when
I'm in that situation again like oh I'm
the one who tweeted if you can't see
yourself working with someone for life
then don't work with them for a day so
as soon as I know that this person is
not gonna be someone that I'm gonna be
working with 10 years from now then I
have to start extricated myself in that
relationship or just not investing that
much more effort into it so I use my
tweets and other people's tweets as
Maxim's
that help compress my own learnings and
be able to recall them because you know
the brain space is finite you finite
neurons so you can almost think of these
as pointers addresses mnemonics to help
you remember deep-seated principles
where you have the underlying experience
to back it up if you don't have the
underlying experience then it's just
reads like a collection of quotes it's
like it's cool it's inspirational for a
moment maybe you make a nice poster out
of it but then you forget it and move on
so all of these are really just compact
ways for you to recall your own
knowledge the last tweet on the topic of
working for the long term is that when
you're finally wealthy you'll realize
that it wasn't what you were seeking in
the first place
but that's for another day that's a
multi-hour topic in of itself first was
thought it was a really clever way to
end the whole thing because it disarms a
whole set of people who'd say well you
know what
some point I get enriched because are a
lot of people who just like the status
signal virtue signal against the idea of
wealth creation or making money so it
was just a good way to disarm all of
them but it's also true in that the
things that you really want in life yes
money will solve all your money problems
but it doesn't get you everywhere
the first thing you'll realize when
you've made a bunch of money is that
you're still the same person if you're
happy you're happy if you're unhappy
you're unhappy if you're calm and
fulfilled and peaceful you're still that
same person I know lots of very rich
people who are extremely out of shape I
know lots of rich people who have really
bad family lives I know lots of rich
people who are internally a mess so I
would lean on another tweet that I put
out which is actually when I think back
on it I think it's my favorite tweet of
mine it's not initially the most
insightful it's not nearly the most
helpful it's not even the one I think
about the most but I just when I look at
it there's just such a certain truth in
there that it just resonates and that is
that a calm mind a fit body and a house
full of love these things cannot be
bought they must be earned even if you
have all the money in the world you
can't have those three things Jeff Bezos
still has to work out he still has to
work in his marriage or whatever his
next relationship is and his internal
mental state is still gonna be very much
not controlled by external events it's
gonna be based on how calm and peaceful
he's inside so I think those three
things your health your mental health
and your close relationships are things
that you have to cultivate and can
probably bring you a lot more peace and
happiness than any amount of money ever
will so that's what I meant now how to
get there is actually a tweet storm that
I still need to put out I've been
working on it I have probably a hundred
tweets on it it's just very hard to say
anything on the topic without getting
attacked from fifty different directions
especially these days on Twitter so I've
been hesitant to do it because I want to
target it for a very specific kind of
person there's a bunch of people who
don't believe that working on your
internal state is useful they're too
focused on the external and that's fine
there's nothing wrong with that they
should do that and that's who they how
to get rich tweet storm is for there's a
bunch of people who believe that the
only thing worth working on is complete
liberation like you become the Buddha
and they'll attack anything in the
middle as being useless that's fine too
but
most people aren't there so what I want
to do is to create a tweet storm that is
just very practical advice for everyday
people who want to have a calmer
internal state just a set of
understandings realizations have truths
and truths that if you were to imbibe
them properly and again these are just
pointers to ideas that you already have
and experiences that you already have
that if you keep these top of mind
slowly but steadily it will help you
with certain realizations that will lead
you to a kamar internal state that's I
want to work on Fitness is another big
one I'm just not the expert there there
are plenty of good people on Twitter who
are better at Fitness than me and I
think loving household and relationships
actually automatically falls out of the
other things if you have a calm mind and
if you've already made money you should
have good relationship there's no reason
why you shouldn't a lot of divorces
actually happen over money unfortunately
that's just the reality of it
so having money removes that part of it
a lot of external battles happen because
your internal state is not good when
you're naturally internally peaceful
you're gonna pick less fights you're
gonna be more loving without expecting
anything in return
and that will take care of things on the
external relationship front so money
solves your money problems money buys
you freedom in the material world I
think that was a tweet from your cutting
room floor and money lets you not do the
things that you don't want to do yeah to
me the ultimate purpose of money is so
that you do not have to be in a specific
place at a specific time doing anything
you don't want to do we skipped one
tweet because I wanted to cover all of
the tweets on the topic of the long term
and the tweet that we skipped was there
are no get-rich-quick schemes that's
just someone else getting rich off you
this goes back to the world being an
efficient place if there's an easy way
to get rich it's already been exploited
and there are a lot of people who will
sell you ideas and schemes on how to
make money but they're just always
selling you some 7995 course or some
audio book or some seminar which is fine
everyone needs to eat people need to
make living they might actually have
really good tips but if they're giving
you actionable high-quality
advice that acknowledges that it's a
difficult journey and will take a lot of
time then I think that's realistic but
if they're selling you some
get-rich-quick scheme whether it's
crypto or whether it's an online
business or seminar they're just making
money off you that's their
get-rich-quick scheme it's not gonna
necessarily work for you one of the
things about this whole tweet storm and
podcast is that we don't have ads on
here we don't charge for anything we
don't sell anything not because I don't
want to make more money it's always nice
to make more money we're doing work here
but because it would completely destroy
the credibility of the enterprise if I'm
saying hey I know how to get rich and
I'm gonna sell that to you it ruins it
when I was young and I was kind of
studying up on the topic one of my
favorite books on the topic was actually
called how to get rich by Felix Dennis
the founder of Maxim magazine
billionaire who passed away and he had a
lot of crazy stuff in there but he had
some really good insights too but
whenever I read something by him or by
the GoDaddy founder Bob Parsons or say
Andrew Carnegie now you read stuff by
people who are already very wealthy and
they've clearly made their wealth in
other fields not by selling the how to
get rich line they have a credibility
you just trust them and they're not
trying to make money off of you they are
obviously trying to win some status and
some ego right you always have to have a
motivation for doing something but at
least that is a cleaner reason why
they're probably not lying they're
probably not fooling you they're not
slowing you at some level every founder
has to lie to every employee of the
company that they have where they have
to convince them that it's better for
you to work for me then is to do what I
did and go work for yourself so I've
always had a hard time with that which
is why the only honest with in my
companies I've recruited entrepreneurs
and I tell them you're gonna get to be
entrepreneurial in this company and the
day you're ready to go start your own
next thing I'm gonna support you I'm
never gonna get in the way of you
starting a company but this can be a
good place for you to learn how to build
a good team and build a good culture how
to find product market fit to perfect
your skills and meet some amazing people
while you figure out exactly what is you
gonna do because positioning timing
deliberation are very important when
starting a company but what I've never
been able to do is look them in the face
and say you must be at your desk by 8:00
a.m. because I'm not gonna be at my desk
by 8:00 a.m. I want my freedom or say
that
that you're great at being a director
today and you'll be a VP tomorrow you
know putting them into that career path
track because I don't believe in it
myself
if anyone is giving advice on how to get
rich and they're also making money off
of it they should have made their money
elsewhere like you don't learn how to be
fit from a fat person you don't wanna
learn how to be happy from a depressed
person so you don't wanna learn how to
be rich from poor person but you also
don't want to learn how to be rich from
somebody who makes their money by
telling people how to be rich
it's suspect anytime you see somebody
who's actually gotten rich following
some gurus advice on getting rich just
remember that in any random process if
you run it long enough and if enough
people participate in it you will always
get every single possible outcome with
probability one there's a lot of random
error in there and then also this is why
you have to absolutely and completely
ignore business journalists and
economists academics when they talk
about private companies
I won't even name names but like when a
famous economist rails on Bitcoin or
when a business journalist attacks the
latest company that's IP owing it's
complete nonsense those people have
never built anything they're
professional critics they don't know
anything about making money all they
know is how to criticize and get page
views and you are literally becoming
Dumbo by reading them you are burning
neurons I'll leave you with a quote from
the same Talib that I liked where he
said if you want to be a philosopher
King first become a king and then become
a philosopher not first become a
philosopher and then become a king I'm
glad you brought up Talib because I was
gonna finish this by saying just
remember the title of his first book
which is fooled by randomness one of the
reasons why we're a little vague in this
podcast is because we're trying to lay
down principles that are timeless as
opposed to just giving you the winning
lottery ticket numbers from yesterday
you summarized this entire Tweed storm
with two words productize yourself
productize and yourself yourself has
uniqueness productize has leverage
yourself has accountability productize
has specific knowledge yourself also has
specific knowledge in there so all of
these pieces you can combine them into
these two words whenever you're doing
anything in business if you're looking
towards a long term
getting wealthy you should ask yourself
is this authentic to me is it myself
that I'm projecting and then am i
productizing it am i scaling it am i
scaling with labour or with capital or
with code or with media so it's a very
handy simple mnemonic I mean what is
this podcast this is a podcast called
nevah land literally productizing myself
with a podcast you want to figure out
what you're uniquely good at or what you
uniquely are and apply as much leverage
as possible so making money isn't even
something you do it's not a skill it's
who you are stamped out a million times
making money should be a function of
your identity and what you like to do
another tweet that I really liked was
this was not mine somebody else put this
up they said find three hobbies one that
makes you money one that keeps you fit
and one that makes you creative I would
change that slightly so I would say one
that makes you money one that makes you
fit and one that makes you smarter so in
my case my hobbies would be reading
making money as I love working with
startups either investing in them
brainstorming them starting them I just
love that ideation and initial creation
phase around startups and then on the
hobby that keeps you fit I don't really
have one closest thing I have is yoga
but that's where I fell apart and I
think people who early in life discover
something like surfing or swimming or
tennis or some sport that they continue
doing throughout most of their life are
very lucky because they found a hobby
that'll make them fit we've finished
discussing the tweet storm and we're
going to spend some time on Q&A and
discussing some of the tweets on the
cutting room floor that didn't make it
into the tweet storm my first question
is do you think there are some common
failure modes or typical things that
people do wrong when they're trying to
apply this advice a lot of people don't
understand what specific knowledge
really is or how to quote unquote
obtain it people don't understand what
accountability really entails they think
that accountability means being
successfully accountable no it means
that you have to stick your neck out and
fail with your name out there publicly
and be willing to let people hate on you
one of the reasons I'm less active and
Twitter lately is because every tweet
summons an army of nit pickers and
haters and it gets exhausted
but on the other hand you have to learn
how to ignore them otherwise you can
survive on Twitter a lot of people try
to reconcile it with like should I quit
my nine-to-five job or not that can be a
very hard decision I don't think you
need to go that extreme you can start
applying accountability and leverage and
specific knowledge even within your
existing career it doesn't have to
necessarily be fork off and do something
else completely a lot of people will use
it as a way to agree and disagree with
their existing biases they'll say oh
yeah I agree with that part or that part
you're completely wrong
the most interesting part should be the
ones that you disagree with
because clearly that proven that I know
a few things so if you disagree with it
then maybe that is an area where you can
improve your thinking I've definitely
improved my thinking all the time but I
will tell you that in this tweets term I
put down the minimum viable principles I
did not put down the whole universe of
what I know about how to make money
because 90% of it is suspect I put down
the bedrock the stuff that I'm pretty
solidly sure about and I have not yet
seen a tweet that has successfully
contradicted anything in this tweet
storm that would cause me to say oh yeah
I got that one wrong think another place
where people get a little bit off is
they look at this and they say well this
only applies to tech entrepreneurs I
disagree the example that I gave about
real estate was a good one in that
regard it's just the nature of leverage
that technology drives leverage so I'm
gonna push you in a tech direction to
get the free leverage that is available
in tech and obviously this message is
being delivered through the internet so
it's going to have a pro internet bias
there are also people who believe that
it is unfair to the people who don't
have these opportunities to do anything
with the opportunites that they do have
well that defeatist attitude why even
get out of bed in the morning ninety
percent of people are dead there's a lot
of people who are living on a dollar a
day do you live on a dollar a day no
it's up to you to play the hand that
you're dealt to the best of your ability
and then you can take the winnings the
pot from that hand and do whatever you
want with it to fix the world but saying
that you should not do things just
because others can't do things is living
in denial it's an excuse to not do
anything there are also people who
believe that wealth creation is
fundamentally at odds with an
environmentally safe and healthy
and they view the whole thing is a giant
zero-sum game that's a false narrative
as well
Elon Musk is not playing a zero-sum game
with the environment and there are
plenty of entrepreneurs who are not if
anything there is a word that
environmentalists love which is
sustainability and for-profit businesses
are at least financially sustainable if
nothing else you can do a B Corp which
has a dual mission a lot of nonprofit
efforts would actually be better served
by for-profit companies because then
they wouldn't have to go begging for
grants all the time they would be
financially sustainable some great
founders realized their philanthropic
visions by running a business
who is this advice targeted to is it for
my lyft driver is it for an internet
entrepreneur is it for somebody who
wants to start a YouTube channel because
it comes from someone who's steeped in
Silicon Valley and tech companies it's
always gonna have a bias towards that
but I think it's good for anybody who
wants to be entrepreneurial anybody who
wants to control their own life anybody
who wants to deterministically and
reliably improve their ability to create
wealth over time is patient and looking
at for the long haul it's certainly if
you're 80 years old retired running out
of energy you should probably just stay
retired but there are 80 year olds who
haven't a lot of energy and want to do
new things and live for the future it
can obviously apply very easily to a
young person I would say 910 years old
and up the most difficult one it's
probably middle-aged because when we're
in our 30s 40s 50s we already have a lot
invested we have a lot of obligations
because those the years where we're
earning and people are relying upon us
we don't want to change because we don't
want to admit defeat
in what we've been doing to date but
that's where it can actually be the most
fruitful it may be the most difficult
pivot you have a 9 to 5 job leave a
family relying upon you and so it may
seem like the things in this podcast are
far too idealistic but maybe it can
inform your weekend projects maybe it
can inform your self free education that
you do at night on the internet maybe it
can inform what roles you take on in the
company that you're at because they move
you closer and closer to points of
leverage points of judgment or points
where you're naturally good at and
you're authentic it might cause you to
take on more accountable
I even applied Pease meals these
principles can directionally guide you
regardless of what stage you are at in
life short of retirement and if you're
in retirement just test them to see if
they're true and then teach them to your
kids or your grandkids there's many
different ways to participate it should
really apply to almost everybody who has
complete body sound mind and is looking
to work I think one way to apply the
advice is to look at who is getting the
leverage off of the work that you're
doing look up the value chain look at
who's above you and who is above them
and see how they are taking advantage of
the time and the work that you're doing
and how they're applying leverage to it
people do that naturally in that they
want to move up the corporate ladder but
that's mostly about managing other
people and what you really want to be
doing is managing more capital products
media and community people think about
moving up the ladder in their
organization but they don't think that
often about moving to a different
organization or creating their own
organization to get more leverage in
general ceteris paribus fancy latin
words for all other things equal you
will do better in a smaller organization
than a larger one you will have more
accountability it'll be more visible you
are more likely to be able to try on
multiple things to find out the thing
that you are uniquely good at people are
more likely to give you leverage through
battlefield promotions you're gonna have
more flexibility there will be more
authenticity to how the company operates
a good progression for careers start out
in a large company and then
progressively move to smaller and
smaller ones it's very hard to go from a
small company to work in a larger
company larger companies tend to be more
about politics and less about merit
they're more stable but they're less
innovative situations the goal long term
is if we are all wealthy is that we're
all working for ourselves and the people
who are working for us are essentially
robots and today that's software robots
in data centers executing code tomorrow
it could be delivery BOTS flying BOTS
mechanical bots that are carrying things
around this goes back to this idea of
the best relationships or peer
relationships if there's someone above
you then that's someone to learn from if
you're not learning from them and
improving then there
shouldn't be anybody above you if
there's somebody below you it's because
you're teaching them and enabling them
if you're not teaching them and enabling
them then get a robot underneath you
don't need a human being below you
this is utopian and it's long ways off
but in the not-too-distant future
anybody who wants to work for themselves
will be able to work with themselves you
may have to make other sacrifices you
may have to take on more risk you may
take on more accountability you may have
less steady income but more and more I
think the younger generation is
realizing that if they're gonna work
they're gonna work for themselves in one
of your tweets you listed out some of
the things you should study like
programming sales reading writing
arithmetic one of the items that ended
up on the cutting room floor was that
you should also study ethics I was
originally going to put that out there
as a concession to people who believe
that making money is evil and that the
only way to make it is evil but then I
realized Efex is not necessarily
something you study it's something you
think about and it's something you do
every one of us has a personal moral
code and where you got that moral code
from is different for everybody it's not
like I can point you to a textbook sure
I could point to some Roman and Greek
texts but that's not gonna suddenly make
you ethical there's the golden rule
right do unto others as you would have
them do unto you or there's nothing
Talib silver rule which is don't do unto
others which you don't want them doing
unto you once you've been in business
long enough you will realize how much of
business is about trust and it's about
trust because you want a compound
interest you want to be able to work for
long periods of time with trustworthy
people without having to reevaluate
every discussion with that and we think
each time and without having to
constantly look over your shoulder and
so over time you gravitate towards
working with certain kinds of people and
similarly those people will gravitate
towards working with other ethical quote
unquote people so being ethical turns
out to be a selfish imperative you want
to be ethical because it attracts the
other long-term players in the network
and then they want to do business with
you and if you build a good enough
reputation for being ethical eventually
people will pay you just to do deals
through you because you're the one
who'll validate and ensure
Neels by your presence because you
wouldn't be involved with low-quality
stuff so being ethical actually pays off
in the long run but it's the very long
run in the short run being unethical
pays off which is why so many people go
for it it's a greedy algorithm but you
can be ethical simply because you're
long-term greedy and I can even outline
a framework for different parts of
so-called ethics just based on the idea
of long term selfishness for example you
want to be honest because it leaves you
with a clear mind you don't have two
threads running in your head one is the
lies that you told it to keep track of
and the other one is what you're saying
you just have to think about one thing
at a time so you have more energy to
think about that thing so your clear
thinker also by being honest you're
rejecting the people who only want to
hear the pretty lies so you forced those
people out of your network and sometimes
it's painful like friends and family but
long-term you create room for the people
who like you exactly the way that you
are so that is a selfish reason to be
honest for example in negotiations if
you're the kind of person who always
tries to get the best deal for yourself
you will win a lot of very early deals
and it'll feel very good but on the
other hand there are a few people who
will recognize that you're always
scrabbling and not acting fairly and
they will tend to avoid you over time
those people end up being the deal
makers in the network because people go
to them for a fair shake or to figure
out what's fair and so if you are
cutting people fair deals you don't get
paid in the short term but in the long
term everybody wants to deal with you
and you end up being a market hub you
have more information you have trust you
have reputation and people end up doing
deals through you a lot of wisdom is
just realized in the long-term
consequences of your actions and so the
longer term you're willing to look the
wiser that you're going to seem to
everybody around you do you want to tell
us about some of the jobs that you had
as a youth and the specific job that
kicked off your fanatical obsession with
creating wealth this gets a little
personal and I don't want to do the
humble brag thing there was some thread
going around Twitter about like name
five jobs you've held and every rich
person on there was trying to signal how
they were held like normal jobs so I
don't want to play that game I've held a
bunch of menial jobs there people have
had
worse than me people who had it better
than me there was one point where I was
washing dishes in the school cafeteria
and I said F this I hate this I can't do
this anymore and I sweet-talk my way to
a computer science prof of helping ta
his CS class in algorithms when I myself
was completely unqualified for that and
so it forced me to learn computer
science algorithm so I could ta the rest
of the course but that desire came out
of the suffering of Washington dishes in
the college cafeteria which is not to
say there's anything wrong with that
there's nothing wrong with anything
really but it was just not for me I did
not enjoy it
I had an active mind and I wanted to
make my money and earn my living through
mental activities not through physical
activities but sometimes it takes the
suffering of doing the wrong thing to
motivate you enough to do the right
thing I worked at a law firm for a while
a big prestigious law firm in New York
City I had a big internship there and I
basically got fired for surfing using
that back in the day this is before the
internet was a big thing using that was
the newsgroups and it was the only way
for me to stay from being completely
bored and I was an overpaid guy wearing
a tie in a suit and had to hang out in
the conference room when the lawyers
needed photocopies I would make
photocopies and the meantime I would be
bored out of my skull this is pre iPhone
thank God to Steve Jobs for saving us
all from unending boredom but I used to
read the Wall Street Journal or anything
that I could get my hands on I would
have read the back of a brochure just to
keep from going insane because listening
to a bunch of corporate lawyers discuss
how to optimize my new details in a big
contract is really dull and they got mad
at me because they wanted me to sit
there quietly and not read The Wall
Street Journal they said that's rude
that's misbehavior so I got called up
and reprimanded a bunch of times and
then I was finally terminated and I was
sent home in shame early from my very
prestigious internship destroying my
chance of going to law school that I was
unhappy for all of an hour but
ultimately it's one of the best things
that ever happened to me because then I
would have ended up as a lawyer not that
I have anything against lawyers but it's
not what I was meant to do you mentioned
the catering job that you had a while
back that really kicked off the whole
obsession that was an Envy thing when I
was in high school I had to make some
money to pay for my first semester at
college and I had to get a job it was a
summer of 19
90 1991 timeframe so this was the bush
senior recession if anyone who's alive
back then remembers it was actually
really hard to get a job
so I ended up working for an Indian food
catering company and I ended up having
to serve at a birthday party for a kid
who it was actually in my school so I
saw my classmates and I was out there
serving food and drinks to them and that
was incredibly embarrassing I wanted to
hide away and die right there but you
know what it's all part of the plan it's
all part of the motivation if I hadn't
had that happened I probably wouldn't be
as motivated and I wouldn't be as
successful so it's all fine but it was
definitely a very strong motivator in
that sense envy can be useful and we can
also eat you alive if you let it follow
you your entire life but there are
points in your life where it can be a
very powerful booster rocket we spoke
earlier about picking a business model
that has leverage from scale economies
Network effects zero marginal cost of
replication there were a few other ideas
on the cutting room floor that I want to
go through with you the first one was
the principal-agent problem so mental
models are all the rage everyone's
trying to become smarter by adopting
mental models I think mental models are
interesting but I don't think explicitly
in terms of a mental model checklists I
know Charlie Munger does but that's just
not how I think instead I tend to focus
on the few lessons that I've learned in
life over and over that I think are
incredibly important and seem to apply
almost universally one that keeps coming
up from microeconomics because as we've
established macroeconomics is not really
worth spending time on is what's called
the principal agent problem principal in
this case is principal with the P al not
ple so it's not a principle that you
follow it's a principle who is a person
a principal is an owner and an agent is
the person who works for the owner so
you can think of it as an employee the
difference being a founder an employee I
can summarize this by a famous quote
that either was said by Napoleon or by
Julius Caesar it's generally attributed
to either one but he said if you want it
done then go if not then send which is
saying if you want to do something right
do it yourself because other people just
don't care enough now the
principal-agent problem
sub everywhere in microeconomics the way
that they try to characterize it is that
the principles incentives are different
than the agents incentives so the owner
of the business wants what is best for
the business and will make the most
money the agent generally wants whatever
will look good to the principal or might
make them the most friends in the
neighborhood or in the business or might
make them personally the most money you
see this a lot with hired gun CEOs
running public companies where the
ownership of the public company is
distributed so widely that there's no
principle remaining so nobody owns more
than 1% of the company the CEO takes
charge stuffs the board with their
buddies and then starts issuing
themselves low price stock options or
doing a lot of stock buybacks because
their compensation is based directly
tied to the stock price so agents have a
way of hacking systems this is what make
incentive design so difficult as Charlie
Munger says if you can be working on
incentives don't work on anything else
almost all human behavior can be
explained by incentives the study of
signaling and signals is seeing what
people do despite what they say people
are much more honest with their actions
and they are with their words you have
to get the incentives right to get
people to behave correctly it's a very
very difficult problem because the good
people aren't purely coin-operated
they're not just looking for money
they're also looking for other things
like status or meaning in what they do
principal-agent problem is the one that
as a business owner you're always going
to be trying to figure out how do I make
this person think like me how do i
incent them how do I give them founder
mentality and I think you have to truly
have been a founder to fully appreciate
how important this founder mentality
thing is and what a difficult and gnarly
problem the principal-agent problem is
what I would say to you is if you are a
principal you essentially want to spend
a lot of your time thinking about this
problem what that means is you want to
take your top lieutenants and you want
to be very generous with them in terms
of ownership and incentives even if they
don't necessarily realize it because
over time they will and you want them to
be aligned with you in how they operate
when you do business deals it's better
to have an aligned partnership where you
both have the same as
then a partnership where you got the
advantage in the deal you negotiate in
such a way that you've got the better
end of the transaction because
eventually the other person will figure
it out or they'll be misaligned and the
partnership will fall apart either way
it's not going to be one of those things
that you can invest into with the
benefits of compound interest over
decades finally if you're in a current
role where you're an agent you're an
employee your most important job is to
think like a principal the more you can
think like a principal the better off
you're going to be long term because
it's training you how to be a principal
long-term and eventually you will become
a principal it's also going to align you
with the principal and a good principal
will then promote you or empower you or
give you accountability or leverage way
out of proportion to what might be your
menial role I'm always very impressed by
founders who will promote up very very
young people through the ranks having
them skip multiple levels despite their
experience and invariably it happens
because this agent who's way deep down
things like a principal so if you can
hack your way through the principal
agent problem you probably solved half
of what it takes to run a company the
reason I asked about this one first is
because I feel like I personally never
see the principal agent problem in my
work I tend to work in small teams where
everybody is highly economically aligned
and the people have been filtered for a
commitment to the mission and everybody
else who doesn't work out moves on to
another role elsewhere these are all
heuristics that you have designed to
avoid having to deal with the single
biggest problem in management another
example of a heuristic you can have that
helps you route around the principal
agent problem is they deal with the
smallest firms possible so for example
when I'm hiring a lawyer or a banker or
even accountant to work on my deals one
of the things that have become very
cognizant about is the bigger firms all
other things equal are generally worse
yes they have more experience yes they
have more people yes they have a bigger
brand but what you'll find is that the
principal and the age
our highly separated and very often the
principal will sell you and convince you
to work with a firm but then all the
work will be done by an agent who simply
doesn't care as much and you can end up
getting substandard service so I prefer
to work with boutiques and my ideal law
firm to work with is a law firm of one
my ideal banker to work with is a solo
banker now you're making other
sacrifices and trade-offs in terms of
that person's resources and you are
betting big in that person but you've
got one throat to choke there's no one
else to point fingers to there's nowhere
to run the accountability is extremely
high if you're an agent the best way to
operate is just say what wouldn't the
founder do if you think like the owner
and you act like the order it's only a
matter of time until you become the
owner let's chat about the Kelly
criterion the Kelly criterion is a very
popular as mathematical formulation of a
simple concept and a simple concept is
don't risk everything stay out of jail
don't bet everything on one big gamble
just be very careful how much you bet
each time so you don't lose the whole
kitty the Kelly criterion mathematically
formulates if you're a gambler even when
you have an edge how much should you
gamble per hand because even when you
have an edge you can still lose so let's
say you're a 51/49 edge every gambler
knows not to bet the whole kitty on that
5149 edge because you could just lose
everything and you don't get to come
back to the average Nassim Taleb
famously talks about organdy City which
is a fancy word for the simple concept
that what is true for a hundred people
on average isn't the same as one person
averaging that same thing a hundred
times the easiest way to see that is by
playing Russian roulette six people who
play Russian roulette once each and then
each winner gets a billion dollars one
person ends up dead five people have a
billion dollars versus one person who
plays Russian roulette with the same one
gun six times is never gonna end up a
billion or is gonna end up worth zero
and so risk taking especially when the
averages are calculated across large
populations is not always rational the
Kelly criterion helps you avoid ruin the
number one way
in which people get ruined and modern
business is not by betting too much but
it's by cutting corners and doing
unethical things or downright illegal
things ending up in an orange jumpsuit
in prison or having a reputation ruined
is the same as getting wiped to zero so
never do those things let's talk about
the shelling point is a game theory
concept made famous by Thomas Schelling
in the book called strategy of conflict
which I do recommend reading it's about
multiplayer games where other people are
responding based on what they think your
response is what he came up with was the
mathematical formalization of how do you
get people who cannot communicate with
each other to coordinate suppose that I
want to meet with you but I don't tell
you where and I don't tell you when we
both want to meet but we cannot
communicate anymore information to each
other that would sound like an
impossible problem to solve we're done
we can't do it
not quite because I know that you're a
rational person and smart and educated
and you know I'm a rational person who's
smart we're gonna start thinking if we
have to pick an arbitrary date
we're probably gonna pick new years and
what time midnight or 12:01 a.m. and
where would we meet what is a big
meeting point well if we're Americans is
probably in New York City it's the most
important city then we're in New York
City will be meet at midnight probably
Grand Central Station under the clock
maybe you end up at the Empire State
Building but not likely you can just use
social norms to converge onto a shelling
point there are many times in many games
where you can look at the game itself
whether it's business or art or politics
and you can find the converging shelling
point within the context of that game
you can cooperate with the other person
here's a simple example let's suppose
that you have two companies that are
competing heavily with each other and
they hold an oligopoly let's say that
they're competing right now and the
price fluctuates between 8 bucks and 12
bucks for whatever the service is don't
be surprised if they both converge on 10
bucks without ever talking to each other
do you want to talk about Pereiro
optimal Pareto optimal is another
concept from game theory along with
Pareto superior
Pareto superior means that something is
better in some ways while being equal or
better in the other ways it's not
worse off in anyway this is an important
concept when you're negotiating with
somebody if you can make a solution
Pareto superior to where it was before
you will always do that Pareto optimal
is when the solution is the best that it
can possibly be then you can't change it
without making it worse in at least one
dimension there is a hard trade-off from
this point forward these are important
concepts to understand when you're
involved in a big negotiation in
negotiation though I would generally say
that this is a tweet that I have
negotiations are won by whoever cares
less negotiation at the end of the day
is about not wanting it too badly if you
want something too badly then the other
person will be able to extract more
price from it if you do care more about
something than the other person and they
are taking advantage of you in a
negotiation then your best way to deal
with that is to turn it from a
short-term game into a long-term game
try to make it into a repeat game try to
bring reputation into line try to bring
other people in who may have a say in
the future or may want to play games of
this person in the future an example of
a very high cost low information single
move game is having your house renovated
contractors are notorious for over
booking ripping people off being
unaccountable I'm sure contractors have
their own side of it the homeowner has
unreasonable demands we found problems
the homeowner doesn't want to pay for it
they don't understand there are low
information buyers it's a very expensive
transaction historically it's been very
hard to find good contractors and the
contractor is no choice on what a good
homeowner is you try to go through
friends you try to go through reputation
and what you're basically doing there is
you're trying to convert a single move
expensive game with a high probability
of cheating on both sides into a multi
move game one way to do that say well
actually I need two different projects
done so the first project we'll do
together and then based on that I'll
decide if we do the second project you
can split your work up into two projects
another way might be I'm gonna do this
project with you and then I have three
friends who want projects done and
they're waiting to see the outcome of
these projects another one might be the
same person operating within the same
community and having a reputation in the
community to protect another one could
be you write them a yelp
or a thumbtack review these are all ways
of turning a single move game into a
longer-term game and helping get past a
position of poor negotiating leverage
and poor information we talked about
compounding and compounding interest but
we didn't really dig into it that much
relationships are a good example of
compound interest once you've been in a
good relationship with somebody for a
while whether it's business or its
romantic life gets a lot easier because
you know that person's got your back you
don't have to keep questioning if I'm
doing a deal with someone that I've
dealt with for 20 years and I trust them
and they trust me we don't have to read
the legal contracts maybe don't even
need to create legal contracts maybe we
can actually do it on handshakes that
kind of trust makes it very very easy to
do business if nivi and I start another
company I know that if things aren't
working out we're both gonna be
extremely reasonable about how to go
about it how to exit out of it how to
shut it down or even if we're scaling
and how to bring in new people at this
point we have mutual trust and that
allows us to start businesses more
easily and almost compounds the effect
especially when you're dealing with
something like a startup which is so
difficult to pull off removing these
frictional mechanisms can actually often
be the difference between success and
failure I think the number one most
under-recognized reason startups fail is
because the founders fall apart there's
a couple non-intuitive things about
compounding the first one is that most
of the benefits of compounding comes at
the end of the compounding so you may
not necessarily see the huge benefits of
it upfront there was a good quote from
an article that Sam Altman wrote where
he said I always want it to be a project
that if successful will make the rest of
my career look like a footnote again
that just goes back to the idea that
most of the benefits of compounding come
at the end the other thing that's a
little non-intuitive about compounding
is that I think it's better to have a
few deep compounding relationships with
people instead of a large amount of non
compounding relationships one of the
under realized things in business is
that it takes just as much effort to
create a small business as it does to
create a large
business whether you're Elon Musk or
whether you're the guy running three
Italian restaurants in town
you're working 80 hours a week you're
sweating bullets you're hiring and
firing people you're trying to balance
the books it's highly stressful and it
takes years and years of your life but
in one case you get companies that are
worth 50 hundred billion dollars and the
adulation of everybody and the other
hand you might make a little bit of
money and you've got some nice
restaurants so think big are there any
other micro economic concepts outside of
zero marginal cost of replication and
scale economies that are important for
people to understand price
discrimination is an important thing to
understand that what it means is that
you can charge people different things
based on their propensity to pay now
you're not allowed different people
different things just because you don't
like them you have to offer them a
little something extra but it has to be
something that rich people care about
business class seats will routinely cost
five or ten times what an economy class
seat does but it probably cost the
airline just two maybe three acts to
provide that it's just the rich person
is more willing to pay so you have to
give them the little things that they
need extra to either signal they're rich
or that little bit of comfort that they
want price discrimination gets used a
lot in enterprise software where you
have a freemium product the free version
will do almost everything but then if
you want the version that's a little
extra secure or hosted on your site or
has multi-user administrations so the IT
person can monitor everything that's
going on you're suddenly find yourself
paying 10 100 or infinite times as much
as you go from a free product to a price
product another good concept is consumer
surplus and producer surplus which is
the excess value that somebody gets even
though they were willing to pay more the
product was priced the same for
everybody I get a lot of joy out of my
morning coffee
obviously I've made some money if my
coffee cost $20 I would pay $20 my
morning coffee
but Starbucks doesn't know that it can't
price the coffee $20 just for me because
selling the exact same product so I'm
getting a lot of consumer surplus out of
the coffee and all businesses generate
consumer surplus it's a good thing to
keep in mind when someone's harping
about how evil companies are Amazon
might be a trillion dollar company
but I will bet you they're generating
trillions of dollars in consumer surplus
through convenience and willingness to
pay there are a lot of people who are
willing to pay more than what Amazon
charges them for all their services
let's talk about NPV NPV is just the net
present value of something it's when you
say that stream of payments I'm gonna
get in the future what is that worth
today so a common example of this is
you're joining a startup company and
you're getting stock options and the
founder says well this company is going
to be worth a billion dollars and I'm
giving you Oh point one percent of the
company therefore you're getting a
million dollars with the stock what he's
or she's arguing is what's gonna be
worth in the future you have to discount
that back to today you have to figure
out what is that worth today and you
have to apply a discount rate or an
interest rate that takes into account
the massive risk the startups face what
you end up with is the price that it's
worth today and that's the price at
which a venture capitalist would invest
in the company today so if that founder
just raised around at ten million
dollars and that company's only worth 1%
of what the founders arguing your
million-dollar package is actually worth
$10,000 so NPV calculations at a very
rough level you should be very
comfortable doing in your head what's a
mispriced externality you mentioned that
at some point during our podcast and
externalities when there is an
additional cost that is imposed by
whatever product is being produced or
consumed that is not accounted for in
the price of the product sometimes you
can fix that by putting the price back
into the product one of the most ardent
ways people attack capitalism these days
is that it's destroying the environment
and if you throw away capitalism because
destroying the environment then guess
what we're all headed back to
pre-industrial times there's not going
to be a good thing so rather there is an
externality because the environment is
finite the environment is precious and
we have to price it properly and fold it
back in if people are wasting water or
putting hydrocarbons in the atmosphere
or polluting things you want to charge
them what it costs to clean up that
pollution return it to a pristine State
perhaps that price has to be very very
very high if you raise that price high
enough you knock out pollution it's much
better than feel-good measures where
we're just gonna ban
plastic bags and we're gonna say don't
take showers and Saturdays and Sundays
when we're having a drought California
likes to run declarations and ads to
scare you into not taking showers and
times when there's a drought when it
would be just much better to raise the
price of fresh water your average
consumer might pay a few pennies more
for a shower
but then the almond farmers who consume
a lot of the water will cut back on
using fresh water and almond farming may
move to a part of the country where
water is more abundant properly pricing
externalities can save resources in a
tremendous way it's a good framework to
think about how to be effective when you
want to do things like save the
environment rather than feel-good things
it won't actually amount to anything one
of the most common questions we get from
people is how do I get the time to start
investing in myself I have a job they'll
take off the answer with one of the
tweets from the cutting room floor where
you said you will need to rent your time
to get started this is only acceptable
when you are learning and saving
preferably in a business for society
does not yet know how to train people
and apprenticeship is the only model
you're gonna have to work starting out
unless you happen to be born rich in
which case you probably won't have the
motivation to make money in the first
place if you're gonna do the work and
join a business where apprenticeship
matters you know Warren Buffett went and
tried to work for Benjamin Graham's
River School to learn how to be a value
investor and you offered to work for
free and Ben Graham said you're
overpriced it's true in that these
apprenticeship businesses you're
probably making a sacrifice in terms of
short term career work there but try to
learn something where people haven't
quite figured out how to teach it yet
and that can happen if you're working in
a field that is brand new and quickly
expanding so no one has figured it out
or it's a fuel that's very
circumstantial where the details really
matter and it's always moving
for example fund investments or
investing in general is one of those
skills entrepreneurship is one of those
skills one of the most coveted jobs
that's come up in Silicon Valley in the
last half decade or so is being a chief
of staff or an entrepreneur where the
brightest young kids will follow the CEO
or the entrepreneur around and do
whatever that person needs them to do
and many cases there
overqualified for the position you may
have someone who has two graduate
degrees who is essentially running the
CEOs laundry for that day because that's
the most important thing that needs to
be done but at the same time they're
also gonna be sitting in all the highest
end staff meetings they're gonna be
privy to all the venture fundraising
decks and all the stress and drama
theatrics innovation and knowledge that
can only come from being Mexican
entrepreneur because the entrepreneur is
willing to do anything and everything to
make their company successful and the
chief of staff was accompanying them and
learning now obviously this is very
Silicon Valley centric tech company
advice if you are currently stuck in a
normal job and you don't have the
opportunity to learn in an
apprenticeship model and you need to
make money then go ahead and do that job
but even within the context of that job
try to be innovative sign up to take on
new challenges new responsibilities find
the part of the job that has a steepest
learning curve what you're really trying
to avoid is repetitive drudgery
repetitive drudgery doesn't serve
anybody then you're essentially just
counting the time until your job is
automated it away even if you're a
barista at the coffee shop try to figure
out how to make connections with the
customers try to figure out how to
innovate on what you're offering them on
your basic service and delight the
customer and what will happen is
managers founders owners they notice the
hardest thing for any founder is to find
people who will work with them who have
founder mentality this is a fancy way of
saying they care enough and what most
people will say well I'm not the founder
I'm not being paid enough to care
actually you are the knowledge and the
skills that you gain by having founder
mentality set you up to be a founder
down the line and it pays you in that
sense you can get a lot out of almost
any position you just have to put a lot
into it if I'm working a job and I want
to figure out if I should get
accountability judgments specific
knowledge leverage it sounds like you're
saying the one thing to optimize for is
specific knowledge out of all those
things if you can judgment takes
experience takes a lot of time to build
up you have to put yourself in positions
where you can exercise judgment that
will come from taking on accountability
leverage is something that society gives
you much later once you've demonstrated
your judgment unless you learn a code or
you become good with media
these are permissionless leverage
leverage kind of comes later judgment
comes later accountability you can take
on immediately you can say hey I'll take
charge of this thing that nobody wants
to take charge Oh
so accountability is where you can step
up but then you're publicly putting your
neck on the chopping block so you have
to deliver specific knowledge gets built
up by taking on accountability for
things that other people don't know how
to do and that perhaps you enjoy doing
or you're naturally inclined towards
doing you can be working in a factory
and it may turn out that the hardest
thing in the factory is knowing how to
raise capital to keep the factory
running and that's what the owner of the
factory is always stressed out about and
if you notice this and you're like I'm
good at balancing my checkbook and a
good head for numbers and I'm good at
watching money but I haven't really
raised money before you offer your help
and become the owner sidekick in that
regard you help solve their biggest
problem you'll become the heir apparent
early on find things where you have any
interest and take on accountability
don't worry about short-term
compensation if you dive into the edge
of knowledge which nobody knows how to
solve and you solve the hard problems
taking accountability people will line
up behind you the leverage will come
there were a couple other related tweets
to this topic from the cutting room
floor that I'll read up first the
technology industry is a great place to
acquire specific knowledge the frontier
is always moving forward if you were
genuinely intellectually curious you
will acquire the knowledge ahead of
others breo technologies around us
everywhere the spoon was technology once
fireless technology once but once we've
figured out how to make it work it
disappeared in the background became
part of our everyday lives so technology
is by definition the intellectual
frontier it's taking the things that are
recent from science or from culture that
we have not yet figured out how to
mass-produce and it's pretty to know how
to commercialize it how to make it
available to everybody so technology
will always be where you can pick up
specific knowledge that is valuable
society that doesn't quite understand
you
for example if I become a world-class
expert in machine learning
just when machine learning is starting
to take off and I got there through my
genuine intellectual interest and I bet
my career on it I'm gonna do really well
but 20 years from now machine learning
may be second hat
there are also timeless forms of
specific knowledge for example if you're
good at persuading people it's probably
a skill that you picked up early on in
life it's always going to apply because
persuading people is always going to be
valuable this is one of those skills
that's generic it probably alone is not
enough to build a career on it needs to
be combined a skill stack you might
combine persuasion with accounting
combined with understanding for example
semiconductor production lines and now
all of a sudden you're the best
semiconductor sales person that becomes
the best semiconductor company CEO there
are timeless specific knowledge skills
those are skills I would say that can
pretty much never be taught and then
there are timely specific knowledge
skills which come and go but even those
tend to have fairly long shelf lives of
decade or two decades or three decades
so technology is a good place to find
those specific skillsets and if you can
bring in a more generic specialized
knowledge skill sets the other tweet
from the cutting room floor was related
to accountability in companies it said
companies don't know how to measure
output so they measure inputs instead
work in a way that your outputs are
visible and measurable if you don't have
accountability do something different
the entire structure of rewarding people
comes from the agricultural and
industrial age where your inputs and
your outputs matched up very closely the
amount of hours that you put into doing
something was a good rough proxy for
what kind of output you're going to get
today it's extremely nonlinear one good
investment decision can make a company
10 or 100 million dollars one good
product feature can be difference
between product market fit and complete
failure so judgment and accountability
matter much much more and you want the
accountability because sometimes the
best engineers or the best salespeople
are the ones who don't work very hard
but then they'll ship that one
critical product at just the right time
or they'll make that one huge sale or
that one huge deal that will make the
company or at least make the numbers for
the quarter it's very important that
people are able to tell that you had a
role in that that doesn't mean that you
stomp all over your team humans are
extremely sensitive to people who take
too much credit so you do want to be the
kind of person that is always giving out
credit but the smart people will know
who was responsible there are jobs where
you're not customer-facing enough where
you're kind of a cog in a machine and
you sacrifice accountability to some
degree an example is when you're a
consultant as a consultant often you're
giving the best ideas and the best
outcome but it's being delivered through
some person who's working within the
organization at that point you may not
have visibility to the top people in the
organizations and you may be hidden
behind a screen and that's just a
trade-off that you're making in exchange
for your independence and the consultant
because you're not willing to play the
corporate rat race or the corporate
ladder game realize that with
accountability you can get a lot more
credit when things go right of course
the downside is you get hurt a lot more
when things go wrong you stick your neck
out you have to be willing to be blamed
sacrifice and even attacked so if you're
the kind of person that thrives in a
high accountability environment you're
naturally also going to end up very
thick-skinned over time you're gonna get
hurt a lot people gonna attack you if
you fail if you're working a job I think
you can apply a lot of the principles of
the tweet storm inside the job like we
just discussed including other ones like
partnering with rational optimists you
can find people in the organization who
are optimistic and rational that have
energy integrity and intelligence and
the flip side of this is that if you
once you get some specific knowledge one
way to scale it is to start training
apprentices that you can then outsource
some of your tasks to for example I made
a bunch of good investments and I
figured out a little bit here and there
about the venture business and I could
keep doing that I could keep just
investing as an investor but instead I
co-founded this project called spearhead
where we train up-and-coming young
founders to also become angel and
venture
investors and we give them a checkbook
an apprenticeship model they come to us
with specific deals of the looking at
and we help them think through every
unique situation and we basically
apprentice them under us to learn the
venture business and it's much more
scalable we have classes and talks where
we have tell them what we know and then
there are office hours when they
actually bring in the deals and they
talk to us about specific deals and it
turns out the classes and talks are
largely worthless you can give all the
generic advice you need to give in about
an hour and then after that all the
additional advice is sore circumstantial
that essentially cancels to zero if you
try to give it in some top-down fashion
but the office hours are incredibly
useful it just reinforces that this is
one of those skills that can only be
learned on the job and when you find a
skill that can only be learned on the
job by doing it that is a good indicator
that you're dealing with specific
knowledge another good indicator with
you're doing specific knowledge is when
you ask the person doing it what do you
do every day and they can't give you a
straight answer or get something on
lines of what everyday is different
based on what's going on that's a good
indicator you're learning specific
knowledge the thing is so complicated
and it's so dependent upon circumstances
that it can't be boiled down into a
textbook form or communicated by a
makemoney consultant the Mafia figured
out this apprenticeship model a long
time ago the best way to end up running
one of the families was to become the
driver for the dawn of one of the
families there's a complicated business
Tony Soprano said I'm a businessman who
has to enforce my own contracts very
complicated business
