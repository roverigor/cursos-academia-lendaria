they're scientifically minded types it's
astonishing who say perhaps we won't be
able to understand the next set of laws
of physics perhaps we won't be able to
understand the aliens it's nothing but
the appeal to the supernatural it's
logically equivalent to
gods out there and you can't possibly
understand what god is god is this
infinite omniscient being that is beyond
us you can believe that if you like you
can believe the simulation hypothesis
you can believe any one of these things
they're all metaphysical claims about a
reality that we have no access to and
whether or not you want to introduce
aliens who will have ideas that we can't
comprehend it's all standing on the same
footing at least the god metaphysics you
could say okay that's in a different
universe that's outside of our laws of
physics but the aliens presumably would
be under the same laws of physics so i
don't even see what the basis for that
is
any species that is smart enough to get
off its home planet knows that the
limiting factor is ideas so the thing
that they should want the most from any
other species they encounter is new
ideas
and the trade that they should be making
is the trade of ideas there's this
malthusian philosophy in science fiction
now called the dark forest hypothesis
that every human species like bacteria
are going to run out of room no the
universe is infinite in size it's
expanding the multiverse is even more
infinite in size we are at the beginning
of infinity we're not running out of
resources everybody's craving ideas
smart alien civilizations trade ideas
and successful civilizations trade ideas
because those ideas take things that
were useless before and turn them into
resources and every alien civilization
can trade ideas with every other
civilization ideas because they're all
universal explainers they're capable of
maximal understanding in fact the
mind-blowing thing here is that your
mind cannot be blown
there's no idea out there that your mind
cannot absorb given the time and the
effort so if we encounter an alien
species we should probably rejoice they
probably don't want anything from our
planet other than our ideas and the best
way to trade ideas is to have a dynamic
abundant thriving civilization
because i grew up on road sci-fi i used
to be pessimistic about alien encounters
oh yeah if we encountered aliens they'll
just destroy us like in hitchhiker's
guide to the galaxy the vogons
thoughtlessly demolished the earth to
make room for a hyperspace bypass but
the reality of it is that any species
that finds us is going to immediately
give us all the knowledge that they have
and they're going to be craving new
knowledge that we have because they'll
realize that that would allow them to
light up the dark matter the dark energy
the unused resources in the universe to
have themselves thrive as well
