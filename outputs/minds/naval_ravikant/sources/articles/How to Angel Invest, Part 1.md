hey this is nivi you're listening to the
navall podcast we haven't published an
episode here in a while and that's
because we've been publishing on another
podcast called spearhead what we're
discussing on spearhead is how to be a
good angel investor I've collected the
first ten or twelve episodes of
spearhead into one long episode and
that's going to start here in about a
minute we decided to put this info into
a different podcast because we want to
stay focused on health wealth and
happiness on the navall podcast
spearhead is a project of ours where we
give founders million dollar funds to
invest into startups if you're
interested in applying for one of these
funds applications are open until
November 21st 2019 I'll put a link to
the application in the show notes here
we go with a sample of the spearhead
podcast if you like it you can find a
link to subscribe in the show notes
enjoy hey everybody it's in the Valen
nivi we're gonna be talking about
something very different than what we've
talked about in the past and the past we
did venture hacks which was all about
the game theory of venture capital and
it helped entrepreneurs raise money we
talked about how to get rich which was
general advice on wealth creation for
the average person who's starting a
business now we're going to talk about
angel investing this one is focusing a
much more narrow audience we expect this
podcast to resonate the most with people
who are in a technology hub and have
started investing but are not yet pros
at investing so brand new angels VCS and
founders were dabbling in it let's say
you're living in Silicon Valley or in
Shanghai or Beijing or even Bangalore or
you're in London or you're in New York
and you get access to a lot of
interesting tech companies you're in the
tech business you have some extra money
that you made along the way or you raise
some money how do you learn to be a good
investor this assumes that you have some
familiarity with investing it's not
gonna be a cold start there are some
resources we can point you to for the
cold start Paul Graham wrote a piece
called how to be an angel investor
there's how to be an angel investor part
2 on venture hacks there's a course
called future investor you can look at
all of those for the basics we're going
to focus on some more advanced topics in
this conversation we're talking
things like how to figure out what a
fair valuation is what are the pitfalls
a bridge rounds how Pro rodda's work
how can you squeeze into a round when
there VC is leading when a co investor
is providing a valuable signal versus
when they're just talking their own book
how to size up markets and startups
quickly should you specialize in single
vertical or should you diversify it into
multiple verticals this podcast is open
sourcing some of the knowledge that we
teach it's spearhead spearhead is a fund
that we built that trains the next
generation of angel investors it takes
founders gives them small checkbooks and
then teaches them the skill of investing
and mentorship for building something
that'll be valuable to them for their
entire lives now this is the Internet
and this is America so we gotta give you
some disclaimers angel investing is a
great way to lose your money there was
an old quip how do you become a
millionaire start as a billionaire and
start investing this is a good way to
lose money if you don't know what you're
doing or if your timing is bad or you're
just plain unlucky this is not
investment advice but if you're already
in the profession or in the hobby of
angel investing you may find this useful
there are tons of important exceptions
to everything we're gonna talk about
technology itself is changing very
rapidly as does the investment ecosystem
a decade ago
Y Combinator was brand-new AngelList
didn't even exist the first round
capital platform wasn't there andreessen
horowitz wasn't there you didn't have a
lot of late-stage investments by hedge
funds you still had companies going
public earlier so the market was very
very different this is really one unique
approach to angel investing the things
we're going to talk about might work for
us from time to time but other people
might take the exact opposite approach
or completely different strategies and
have similar or better results we're
very focused on early-stage technology
startups in the San Francisco and
Silicon Valley a lot of this may not
translate to other locales and it almost
definitely will not we'll also be
discussing startups and funds that we've
personally invested in and have a
financial interest in and we're
constantly changing our minds of
learning that's what intelligent people
do we hold contradictory and opposing
thoughts in our head at the same time we
have a multitude of opinions that often
contradict each other this is not math
or science or equations
and we're always changing her opinions
as Marc Andreessen says strong opinions
loosely held the best way to make money
in the technology industry like any
other industry is to be an owner of a
piece of a business you're not gonna get
rich renting out your time you must own
equity and peace of a business to gain
your financial freedom so how did you
gain substantial equity in a business
the classic models are your start a
company and you become successful this
works as a founder you own a big piece
it's high stress very grueling very few
companies succeed you may have to get
back up at the plate and take a few
rounds at bat let me take you a while a
second way is you can be an extremely
competent execution person who gets
recognized so that when the next
successful company is scaling whether
it's an uber or Dropbox then Travis or
drew call up their favorite investors
and say hey who are your 10 best
engineers that you're working with that
I can recruit right now or the 10 best
designers you've worked with it I can
recruit right now and someone who's done
a great job at other companies for
investors and entrepreneurs before will
get paid a fairly large amount of equity
for joining a company that's already
solved product market fit and it's a
rocket ship then finally you can do it
as an investor and as the hits become
bigger and bigger and the returns become
more and more nonlinear it makes more
and more sense to play as an investor
and a little bit less sense to play as a
founder the reason for this is because
the upside is nonlinear when you invest
in a start-up you could in theory make a
hundred X a thousand x of 5,000 x at
10,000 X return if you were in a
Facebook seed round for example and your
own company you may own a lot more of it
but you may only make a 10x or 100x
return the human brain is not wired to
understand nonlinearities but the people
who do people like Paul Graham and Peter
Thiel end up becoming billionaires as
investors rather than through companies
that they had themselves directly
started now being a founder is a lot
more fulfilling many of the investors
they wish that they were building
something because it does give you a
deeper sense of purpose there is that
sense of teamwork and really being
involved on the other hand it burns you
out and it ages you quickly being a
founder your entire life is a very tough
road to go and most people do not have
the Constitution for it angel investing
is something you can be doing when
you're 50 when you're 60 when you're 70
years old
it's some
you can do part-time it's something you
can do if you're partially retired or if
you're in maternity leave or paternity
leave it's something that you can get
better at even if you're not devoting
yourself completely to that field and
it's something that can make you money
when you're too tired or have too big of
a family or if some kind of a health
issue so you can't just be cranking as
an entrepreneur Warren Buffett is one of
the richest self-made people on the
planet because he's been compounding for
a long long time he started reading
annual reports when he was 10 11 12
years old and he's been going strong if
he'd started after college instead of
starting when he was 10 years old he
would be nowhere near the top 400 lists
on Forbes because the magic of
compounding wouldn't have worked there
was a famous line know something about
everything you know everything about
something so in that sense it's great to
have been a founder and then also to do
some investing we're living through a
very unique time when his entry since a
software is eating the world were
undergoing a phase shift where
technology rather than just being
adopted by knowledge workers is being
adopted by everybody
this transition that we're going through
means it is a gold rush era in
technology if you happen to be living in
one of the technology hub cities there's
only a handful of those and if you have
to ask if you're in one of them then you
probably aren't usually it's obvious
when you're living in one of them there
will be hundreds of startups at least
within that city there have been some
exits there have been some people who
got rich off of it if you're living in a
tech hub and you're in the tech industry
you're already halfway there that's half
the battle you were well-positioned to
angel invest and if you're in the tech
industry you're not living in the tech
hub then you should consider moving to a
tech hub unless there's strong lifestyle
reasons that keep you away such as
family or quality of life which often is
higher outside of the technology hubs so
getting into the tech hubs to do the
angel investing is half the battle you
can do it remotely but the odds are
stacked against you you don't have the
trust networks you don't see enough of
the deal float so then it's better to
work through a proxy like investing in a
trusted friends venture fund or going
through angel list or coming in for YC
demo day and so on you think this is
just for people in Silicon Valley or
does this apply in New York does it
apply and Seattle Austin China Bengaluru
I think it applies in probably about a
dozen two dozen cities around the world
the thing that's hard here is that some
of these cities are emerging and some
are not
Seattle is probably pretty stable Austin
is pretty stable you can probably find
good deals there but you really have to
see everything and you have to have
access to everything and realize that
maybe there's one or two great ones
that'll be created there every year
Silicon Valley is a little more
forgiving in that there's maybe twenty
or thirty great companies being created
every year and you just need to get
access to one of those from a larger
pool of course someplace like Bengaluru
or maybe even Kuala Lumpur these might
be up incoming cities but then timing is
hard is this when the city breaks
through is this when the tech industry
there breaks through you're in Australia
if you invested in canva great or if
invested Atlassian great but if not one
of those two then there's not as much
will pool so timing becomes a lot harder
but at the same time your returns can
potentially be a lot higher because
there's less competition the valuations
are lower the risks are higher but you
don't want to be doing is sitting in a
city that doesn't have a history of
producing good startups where you only
see one or two startups a year you
invest in half of them and you're paying
Silicon Valley prices because they're
looking at why Commodore demo day and
keying off of the valuations there it's
certainly much safer and easier to get
started in San Francisco or New York or
Beijing or Shanghai or Bengaluru if
you're a pro you can play in London
Austin Seattle Denver Boulder Chicago
etc anything below that and you better
know what you're doing we definitely
have seen this phenomenon on AngelList
where angel investors of investing
locally in a city that is not producing
good tech startups will basically
surrender and then start investing
through Angeles into Bay Area startups
and they just see the quality and the
returns are so much higher what's the
best indicator that a start-up hub is
working is it exits is it a thriving
community of other angel investors
unfortunately its exits the normal angel
investing dynamic starts with founders
start a company company does well
founders and all the employees get rich
in the IPO or the acquisition and then
they start investing money in their
friends and engineers and designers and
marketers who work with them at their
company
and they feel a lot more comfortable
doing this early investing because
that's how they made their money they
made their money through tech startup so
they want to put it back into tech
startups there's a lot of false starts
where you'll have a lot of angel
investors pop up in an area and they'll
invest in a bunch of companies but then
those companies get stranded because
there's no series a or series B VCS
there to invest in them or because it's
only one or two series a or series be
VCS when they come in they pay low
valuations they wipe out the early
investors they convert them to common
they cram them down they put warrants on
top so funding markets to some extent
develop and reverse the least risky
investments are mezzanine rounds right
before the company goes public the next
least risky investments were serious
Dee's and serious C's then more riskier
serious bees even more riskier serious
and the most riskier angel investing so
in a weird way angel investing is the
thing that should develop last that's
not always the case because if a company
can break out with just angel money then
later stage money will find it almost no
matter where it is or that company can
move to a later stage hub but now you
have a big gap between your investment
and then when the next investor is gonna
show up and that means the company has
to get really really far and very little
money
the returns in angel investing are kind
of interesting there's this meme that
goes around that angel investors lose
all their money and that VC is a
terrible business this is somewhat true
and somewhat not it's true if you start
aggregating VCS and angel investors from
all across the world but if you stay
focused in technology hubs it's largely
not true a competent angel investor in
Silicon Valley who's plugged into the
network and knows what they're doing and
has a broad portfolio can expect to make
summerween 3 to 10 times their money
over a decade that's quite a return
although there is a very high specific
knowledge and labor that goes into each
investment which is not being counted
also keep in mind that these are capital
gains which are usually taxed at lower
rates and income partially because it's
a secondary tax on corporate income it's
sort of been taxed once at the corporate
level and also there are tax breaks for
angel investors ranging from the
qualified small business stock exemption
in the u.s. to some very favorable tax
investing breaks in the UK and other
countries from a tax advantaged basis if
you're willing to tolerate the high risk
and the illiquid are-- it's very hard to
look at any other asset class where you
can make as much of a raw return on your
money as you can as a patient
diversified plug in angel investor one
way to think about it is the less
efficient the market and the more wealth
the underlying asset is creating the
better off you're going to do for
example art doesn't really create that
much wealth it's more of a tax haven
slash speculation instrument and same
with wine the asset itself is not that
wealth generating but the underlying
market is very inefficient so you can
make money more easily gambling is
wealth destructive it actually destroys
wealth so it's not a great asset class
to play and unless you're the casino
owner in which case you have an edge and
everybody else angel investing is odd
and that very few people can play in it
very people have to know how the
geographic access the capital and the
risk horizon and the patience but at the
same time the underlying assets that
you're investing in are changing the
world in a daily basis I see a lot of
people on Twitter who could be good
angel investors who are sitting in
Silicon Valley who have access to deal
flow who are in the tech industry and I
see them spending a lot of time thinking
about macroeconomics what if the feds
gonna cut interest rates what's gonna
happen to the trade
or in China or they're out shorting
stocks or they're investing in special
economic zones or they're buying and
selling real estate and flipping that or
you have a very good friend of mine
who's a great VC who's also running a
rental business on the side and I would
scratch my head a little bit you're
living inside the goldmine there are
people literally digging up gold next to
you the returns in this industry are
higher than anything else you understand
it so well you have specific knowledge
but there is this contempt that you have
for investing further into the industry
that just comes from your own
familiarity and if you're in the tech
industry you should be doubling down I
don't know of a better industry on the
planet or a better place on the planet
to be investing for today
the technology industry is becoming the
place where wealth gets originated and
then it can get spread out but
increasingly the Wall Street financiers
are coming to Silicon Valley to invest
in companies before they get to Wall
Street by the time a company goes public
you can pretty much bet that anybody who
had any connections who had any appetite
whether any capability got a bite at it
so if you're buying a tech company when
it goes public you are literally last in
line it's not to say you can't make
money but the odds are way down because
this fruit has been picked over many
many many times the last bunch of
Finance ears who were sitting in the
right place at the right time
we call them Wall Street these were the
people where you used to get capital for
your startup there was no other market
for fundraising until you had the
metrics to go public now Silicon
Valley's turning into the new Wall
Street except it's not as formalized and
organized and segmented as the
traditional Wall Street the JP Morgan's
haven't popped up and the Nasdaq seven
popped up yet this is gonna fly in the
face of conventional wisdom for the
average person you should be saving for
your retirement but I never set out to
save anything I reinvested everything in
economics there's the identity s equals
I savings equals investment so even if
you'd save into your 401k it's actually
just getting reinvested but it's getting
reinvested into some very quote unquote
safe but very unproductive parts of
society such as the government you're
investing in the DMV in the Defense
Department and their returns to date
have not been spectacular it's
essentially just whatever money they can
take a gunpoint from both taxpayers and
foreigners generally it's probably a
better bet if you're in the tech
industry to invest back in the tech
industry especially if you're young and
especially if we can get diversified
invest in the smartest and best and
brightest people that you know around
you as opposed to far away people in
faraway lands with faraway motives who
are frankly just not as motivated and
have trillions of dollars of capital
flowing into them $50,000 in your IRA
isn't gonna make much of a difference in
the US government when it gets put into
a t-bill but 50 grand invested into an
entrepreneur down the street is gonna
make a huge difference to their lives
and if you can find 10 20 30 50
investments like that at least one or
two of them will pay off assume
you listen to us and build up some
skills along the way most of my net
worth is a liquid and lying in start-up
companies but I sleep well at night
knowing that I literally have hundreds
of teams of brilliant entrepreneurs who
stayed at the top schools and are
leveraged through code because they have
engineering degrees great designers they
leveraged through capital because they
raised venture money after I invested
their leverage through products that
they're building that have no marginal
costs of reproduction and using the most
modern methods of distribution all of
them are working very hard to build
things that could be massive and change
the world and it's just going to take a
few than workout for the entire
portfolio to balance out if you have a
1000x return in your portfolio somewhere
which is not that unheard of in angel
investing you could have made a hundred
investments to get there and your
overall portfolio will still be a 10x
even if the other 99 go to zero the
three things it takes to get into the
investing business or deal flow judgment
and capital capital is the hard one
either you made some money before or
other people trust you enough to give
you capital many of the top VCS are
related to married two or come from
families that have an enormous amount of
capital sometimes you look at those
people you scratch your head and you say
how is this person in the venture
business well they had a lot of family
money or they married into money or they
were managing money for somebody else or
they were friends with a billionaire or
it or had access to some large fund and
that access to the capital is what got
them in the business if you joined
spearhead we actually give the spearhead
leads who were founders who were
training up to be investors we give them
million-dollar checkbooks and then we
help them raise more money from limited
partners later on so that is another way
to get capital you can always raise it
from friends and family but this is both
the hardest and the easiest depending on
who you are the second is judgment as
they say good judgment comes from
experience and experience comes from bad
judgment often it just takes time to
build up judgment can often be about
applying your highest standards and your
taste in the things you know the best to
other people very often as a founder you
have a very high bar for yourself you
only want to recruit the absolute best
you only want to do your best work
you're constantly into self-improvement
you're always the worst critic of your
own business and you
own product every little thing in your
product that's wrong bothers you but
then you meet somebody else and they're
raising money and you fall in love with
your idea and you ignore the fact the
person it doesn't seem that smart or
it's not someone that you'd actually
work for or even hire or their product
is only half-baked or have finished or
they're executing slowly just look past
all that you'll lower your judgment
because you start fantasizing about all
the things that can go right so it's
very important when you're investing in
other people that you keep a high bar
you have to have taste some of the best
investors that I know are incredibly
difficult people it's very hard to
please them and they see the problems
and everything in that sense a good
investor can often be a lot more cynical
or pessimistic than a good founder good
founder has to be a rational optimist
where it's a good investor sometimes
will bounce maniacally between being
optimistic enough to see the future and
get into the deal and being pessimistic
enough to see all the downsides and pass
on nine out of the ten that look at if
you're doing more than one out of every
ten deals that you look at you're
probably being too optimistic if you
keep stumbling into all the great deals
all the time that says more about you
than it does about your deal flow there
are always exceptions of course if
you're sitting in the latest YC batch
and you're getting to see everything
good that's going on early or if you're
running the Stanford entrepreneurship
Club and you've seen tons of deals go by
and you may have a unique advantage to
your network the last piece though the
deal flow and the access that's we're
gonna focus on which is how do you get
deal flow how do you get good access
deal flow and access are not the same
thing you can get deal flow by going on
Angel lists you can get deal flow by
going and sitting at Y Combinator demo
day you can get deal flow by going to
any technology conference bake-off you
can get deal flow by watching shark tank
but that doesn't mean you have access
into those deals it doesn't mean that
you have the ability to invest in those
deals when you want on the terms that
you want when the deals get really hot
and you get cut out that is assigned to
you that you're gonna perform poorly as
an angel investor you need to do
whatever it takes to up your access why
is it so important to get allocations
and the deals that you want to get into
what happens if you don't isn't there
just a lot of deal flow out there almost
every angel investor if you look at
their portfolio the majority of the
return
come from one deal and then if you look
at the remaining returns once you take
that top deal out the majority of those
returns come from the second deal so
it's extremely nonlinear if you were to
take the top two to three deals out of
every funds portfolio you'd basically
have a negative performing fund as
opposed to what would normally be four
five six 10x fund one company out of a
hundred or one company out of a thousand
accounts for all the returns every year
so it's all about adverse selection when
you get cut out of the deals that you
wanted to get into the odds of that
being one of those big winners goes from
let's say 100 to one in three or one in
five what'll often happen is you'll meet
a company you're taking your time
deciding and then all of a sudden the
top branded investor rolls in writes a
big check next thing you know everybody
piles in there's a strong signal and now
the entrepreneur says sorry the rounds
closed or only have 10k left for you
these are times when brand makes a
difference i partially started angel
list because i was cut out of some very
big deals early on that to this day I
have some farms over these are
career-defining deals if I had been in
that would have made tons of money but
my brand simply wasn't strong enough
even though you want to be non-consensus
right there does come a point at which
consensus has value when the Sequoias of
the world show up when the statistics
become more baked when the founders are
better known when there's more
information on the table and to some
extent Sequoia investing is a partially
self-fulfilling prophecy because it
takes away some future financing risk
and it gives the company they did a
stand out when it's recruiting or going
for PR this is why it's often better to
back another great angel investor and
pay them their carry that is to go and
try and be one of your own a lot of
people balk at this idea that oh I'm
gonna pay you a management fee or a
percentage the upside frankly an angel
investing is to steal the old
two-and-twenty model was put in place by
KKR which was a big private equity for
imagine billions of dollars the fact
that you can get someone who's managing
a million dollars to charge you the same
to in 20 when their labor as a
proportion of the invested capital is
far far higher it's dirt cheap go to YC
and tell them you would like them to
invest your money at the same time they
put in their own money at the beginning
for two-and-twenty and they'll
you out of the room we get into good
deals you need to build the brand
typically by adding value to the startup
in some unique way why don't we talk
about 101 different ways to build a
brand this is the meat of it this is the
heart of it we'll get into how to
develop good judgment we can get into
the ins and outs of raising capital
all of those are secondary the single
most important thing is having the
ability to get into a deal that you want
to get into and that is access and the
way to get access is to have a brand a
brand in this context is an authentic
reputation that you have with the
founders and other investors that tells
other people around the table
yes let's let this person invest in our
round even though it's scarce and
everybody wants to get in now the
signals are there so how do you build a
brand the classic brands in the venture
business have a reputation for having
made great investments Sequoia was built
this way and reason was partially built
this way where you pay up for deals and
later rounds on companies that already
have product market fit you associate
with their brand and then you used that
to get into earlier and earlier hotter
and hotter deals so the best way to
build a brand is almost a tautology
which is to invest in the winning
companies and then that gets you into
the winning companies okay but that
circular it doesn't help that much
another way to build a brand is to
provide something that's profounder that
the environment does not yet already
offer this could be a stance for example
in recent Horowitz is a famously founder
friendly stance they want to see the
founders run the company it could be
content I've built a brand through
Twitter
II let Gil build a brand pah-wraiths
with a high growth handbook that he
wrote Reid Hoffman has written some
books of course although he's had got
many other reasons to have a good brand
Paul Graham wrote amazing pieces that
attracted everybody to YC and hacker
news when he was getting started the
Fred Wilson still maintains the most
popular blog and venture capital at ABC
Brad Feld later a lot of mechanics of a
VC investing that allowed him to run a
find out of Boulder which is unusual so
you can definitely build a brand through
blogging David Hornick and Andrew anchor
and I started venture blog one of the
first venture related blogs back in the
day should have stuck with it a lot of
the great brands in
memory have been built by being
extremely founder friendly and by
providing either content or networks or
software or platforms or access for
entrepreneurs that did not exist before
number one was being a good investor to
begin with number two is by creating
content that helps entrepreneurs a third
one is you can build infrastructure a
platform that helps entrepreneurs Paul
Graham can get deals because of Y
Combinator maybe and I often can get
into deals because we started angel
lists and that helps entrepreneurs at
scale
Ryan Hoover can get into deals because
he saw a product hunt the first round
capital guys had the platform which
helps them win deals against other VCS
andreessen horowitz has its famous
platform of people who are helping out
companies left and right that's another
example of a way to build a brand by
helping founders you could also start a
conference jason Lemkin did this with a
sastra conference Tim O'Reilly and
O'Reilly Media ventures have both
publishing and conferences Stephen Lauri
is greater recruiting so he started team
builder ventures he put it right in his
brand name so now when he goes to
companies they know what he's good for
they know why to give him a piece of the
round and what he's going to help them
with there are nuances to this though a
lot of times VC will say we need to
build a brand therefore we need to have
a blog let's hire a content writer and
write a blog or man I better up my
Twitter game let me get over on Twitter
and start telling entrepreneurs what my
investment criteria are the truth is
you're not going to build a brand
because you want to build a brand the
brand is going to be an authentic
expression of who you are so whatever
your unique insight already is into the
technology ecosystem the venture
business investing in startups you have
to express that in the most authentic
way possible so if you're good at
Twitter get on Twitter if you're good at
blogging get on blogging if you're good
at writing books get on writing books if
you're good at speaking go to conference
distance P if you're good at talking do
a podcast but you're not gonna be
successful by aping somebody else it's
gonna have to be authentic to you
also the media airwaves are now crowded
so you have to create top quality
content need to have top quality
distribution the work that Navy and I do
in this podcast even though it's an
amateur effort we cut things up into
snippets we clean up the voices we
create transcripts we create highlights
which
leading edge of the curve sure other
people will copy us and catch up but by
then we'll be somewhere else we may be
off to writing a book or we may be doing
a road show or running an incubator or
building another software platform but
because we're always tinkering at the
edge and we enjoy that tinkering at the
edge it's easy for us to stay ahead of
the competition
whatever your brand is it has to be
clearly articulated it has to be message
it has to be authentic to who you are it
should be differentiated from what
everybody else is offering and it should
resonate with entrepreneurs the worst
strategy you can take is to take a lot
of coffee meetings or say oh yeah I'm a
good passive hands-off person I won't
bother you and I'm always available to
help student you can build a brand
through your advisers and limited
partners but if you have a small fund
and many of the investors and advisors
to your fund are let's say professors of
computer science at major universities
then entrepreneurs will want you as an
investor because you have access to
these people who can bring grad students
or help technology diligence or solve
hard algorithmic problems you may come
from the real estate industry so all the
real estate tech plays want you in
because you have a deep understanding of
real estate and your real estate
investors in your real estate contacts
need real estate properties you could be
the world's expert on helping the
startup raise its next round
you can build software for startups like
AngelList I think there's still five ten
a hundred different things in the world
of software to help startups that
haven't been done you can be an expert
on raising money from international
investors raising from China or Brazil
you can break into a new market by
backing the scientists and the
technologists in a new market you can be
a world's expert at scaling you could
build open-source tools for startups
there's extremely little innovation in
the venture capital business it's
actually quite easy to stand out you
just have to be willing to do something
that other people haven't done before in
other words you have to be willing to
take on accountability and the risk of
being wrong do you think someone will
try to build the brand around buying
common stock from entrepreneurs at some
point instead of purchasing preferred
stock some people have already done that
a little bit andreessen horowitz
starting to do that in the sense that
they became registered investment
advisors so they can do secondaries you
could argue that's actually a core part
of YC
is brand they buy at a very low
valuation in that first round but they
used to buy a common so they were
completely in the same boat as you
there is no branded firm or angel
investor who's writing large checks that
is by in common I think it's the very
clever strategy and something that we
may yet see happening and it does have
the problem where the company can shut
down and keep your money but there are
clever ways around that you could say
okay I'm buying preferred stock but
after two years it converts the common
stock so you're running your company for
a while when you burned through my cash
and you raise somebody else's cash at
that point I'm no longer sitting on top
of you in a liquidation preference
overhang but at the same time my money
has already been spent so it's not like
you can shut down the company and run
off with my money my original brand
started out strangely enough growth
hacking where I co built a Facebook app
that got 20 million installs pretty
quickly I used that as my calling card
when I was going and talking to
entrepreneurs this was back in the early
growth hacking days before growth
hacking had a bad name a friend told me
about Twitter and I tried it and I liked
the product at the time it was all text
message based this is a pre app I
tracked down Evan Williams and ever just
given back investors a bunch of money
for a failed podcasting venture called
audio he'd kept Twitter which was the
one thing out of a studio that looked
interesting but it's still very much a
toy I went to EV about investing at that
point his round was done he had a little
bit of allocation left and he basically
was posing the question of well why
should I let you invest I got up on the
whiteboard and I laid out what little I
knew at the time about growth hacking
this was before Andrew Chen blew it open
for the world he did that for about half
an hour while he and his deputy watched
at the end he said this sounds great
we're not gonna do any of it because
it's against her ethos and I respected
him for that but he was impressed enough
that I cared and I thought about it that
I got a chance to put into Twitter and
that was my first major angel investment
that worked out are there any new angel
investors that you think have done a
good job of building a brand recently I
don't know if they necessarily build a
brand to invest but I think they'll have
a brand through their natural activities
and then that will give them the ability
to invest the rest of it the judgment
and the capital and so on is still up to
them
I think Ryan Hoover has a great brand
his Twitter game is among the best I've
seen in the world
he's always community
on Twitter just by the side-effect of
breathing he's gonna have a good brand
as an angel investor especially into
consumerist things
another good brand is Patrick Freedman
he's basically investing in start-up
countries and sovereign individual
projects as a unique enough thesis and
unit of angle that all the libertarian
types and all the free state types are
gonna flock to him just by being the
first one to put down a stake in the
ground saying I'm gonna fund these kinds
of activities means you'll get to see
all of the limited deal flow in that
space and at the same time there are
lots of other projects especially in
crypto that aren't necessarily about
starting a free state but they overlap
and the people who start those companies
have sympathies towards free state
projects and are themselves sovereign
individuals these were people who sign
the petitions to free Ross Ulbricht and
Julian Assange and so on and I'm one of
them by the way so they're gonna be
naturally inclined towards letting him
invest there's probably some ways to
build a brand that are going to get you
stuck in ways that you don't want to be
for example you don't want to build a
brand around just a specific market
thesis right you don't want to have a
brand around the transition from X
technology to white technology because
when that transition is complete so is
your brand you also don't want to have
too narrow of a brand or a brand in a
space that doesn't materialize if you
have a clean tech brand that's focus
entirely on solar and solar doesn't
arrive on schedule then your entire area
of expertise is shot when you're first
starting out because of your expertise
in your network and because you want to
raise capital there's a pressure to
specialize but if you look at the top VC
firms they're actually rarely
specialists they're usually generalists
and even when they specialize they'll
specialize in being weird like founders
fund they specialize in a lot of deep
tech deals and weird deals but they
don't specialize further than that they
don't say we're sent by only or we're AI
and machine learning only you have to
resist that urge because very often
these trends don't materialize I'm old
enough to remember when clean tech was a
wave that cost kleiner perkins a lot of
money or when java was a wave that cost
investors a lot of money because those
never turned out to be massive markets
or took a lot longer than people
expected you could already in clean tech
if you've gotten Tesla SpaceX that
forgave everything but also means if you
didn't
to Tesla SpaceX if you weren't in the
Elon Musk mafia and you were in clean
tech you missed everything so you don't
want to be too narrow at the same time
if you're too broad then it's hard to
stand out then you're back to it I'm a
good person who does coffee well let me
invest it's better to build a brand
around your unique capabilities and your
unique platforms and assets but not
around verticals
the best deals tend to come out of your
network there tends to be people that
you've known and trusted for a long time
it's notoriously difficult to invest in
one of Ellen Musk's companies even in
very high-priced rounds trying to get
into a SpaceX or into a neural link is
nearly impossible because all the people
that Elon has made money for in the past
all swoop in get first rights and they
always take up the full allocation if
you're getting invited to one of Ellen's
rounds and you've never met him and
you've never made money with him before
you almost have to wonder if he's run
out of all the other friends that he had
the urge to go out and hunt for deals I
will actually lower your returns some of
the best angel investors make their
early wins by investing in people and
spaces that they know really well that
are tightly and closely within their
network and it's only when your network
is exhausted but now in exchange you
have a reputation and your more capital
because you've made some money and been
successful investing your network that
it makes sense to start branching out
because now your reputation capital and
know-how without those it's very
dangerous to start going investing in
spaces that you don't know in people
that you don't know and most dangerously
into deals you're invited in to by
strangers because you can bet that if
they're inviting a stranger they've
already exhausted their network of close
allies and comrades do you still think
there's an opportunity to build a brand
at the proceed stage before the
accelerators or simultaneous with
accelerators accelerators exist to give
advice on how to start a company and
scale the accelerator round isn't really
there because they're giving you the
capital they're not giving you that much
but they're giving you important
know-how how to put your company
together how to recruit how to Rev your
idea when is it ready for investors how
to get your MVP out there how to measure
customer growth how to approach the
first customers and all of that the
training wheels until you're ready to go
raise money and the truth is an angel
investor can do this they just have to
put in the time and actually them is the
best place to play because evaluations
at the so-called seed ranges or where a
round used to be if you want good
valuations and the best deal flow the
best ways to create yourself by a lying
with entrepreneurs early on becoming
their shadow business co-founder
technical entrepreneurs today builders
when they start out they often have to
give up
half or two-thirds of the company to a
seller to put the company together
before them and raise the money you can
be that shadow partner you could help
them put the company together you could
put in the first little bit of money you
might even be able to get common equity
in addition to your investment or a
favorable investment terms and then you
can help them recruit the seller later
on for five or ten percent of the
company as opposed to 50 percent of the
company
if you're investing at the proceed stage
you can back great teams you can set the
terms that you want and you can get
pro-rata rights pro-rata rights are the
ability to invest in later rounds let's
say that you own 5% of a company through
your original investment that means
every round they raise in the future
your pro rata right will give you the
right to invest another 5% of that round
even though you already owned a lot to
begin with and you may not care as much
about the dilution the cash on cash
returns for later investments tend to be
much better because the amount of money
you can put in might be thirty million
dollars instead of three thousand
dollars once the company's more proven
limited partners and big funds will
fight for pro rata rounds and pay you
carry and pay you management fees to
invest that pro rata for them and you're
not waiting ten years for the quiddity
the later rounds it might only be two
years away from the quiddity
so pro rata can be quite valuable it
also keeps you more plugged into the
company you keep a closer relationship
as a management team they have to let
you know what's going on and if there's
a down round or a washout round it lets
you have more senior stock that can at
least protect some of your holdings on a
wipe out scenario
