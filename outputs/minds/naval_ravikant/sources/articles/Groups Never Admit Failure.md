groups never admit failure a group would
rather keep living in a mythology of we
were oppressed than ever admit failure
individuals are the only ones who admit
failure even individuals don't like to
admit failure but eventually they can be
forced to a group will never admit they
were wrong a group will never admit we
made a mistake because a group that
tries to change its mind falls apart so
i'm hard pressed in history to find
examples of large groups where they've
said we thought a but the answer is
actually b
usually what happens in that case is a
schism where you go from catholic church
to protestant and so on there's a
divergence and usually a lot of
infighting this happens in crypto land
too where the coins fork bitcoin doesn't
suddenly say we should have had smart
contracts or eth doesn't suddenly say we
should have been immutable i was on the
board of a foundation that was charged
with giving out money for a cause
and i found it very disillusioning
because what i learned was that no
matter what the foundation did they
would declare victory they would give
money for a certain thing they would
support a certain project and every
project was victorious every project was
a success there was a lot of back
slapping there was a lot of high
sounding mission statements and vision
statements a lot of congratulations a
lot of nice dinners but nothing ever got
done and what i realized was because
there is no objective feedback because
there is no loss it's all social profit
they couldn't fail and because they
couldn't fail they misdirected resources
all day long and eventually of course
such groups run on money if you want to
change the world to a better place the
best way to do it as a for-profit
because for-profits have to take
feedback from reality ironically
for-profit entities are more sustainable
than non-profit entities they're
self-sustainable you're not out there
with a begging bowl all the time and of
course you lose the beautiful non-profit
status you have to pay your taxes and
also you can get corrupted by being
purely for-profit but i would argue that
the best businesses are the ones that
long-term are both for-profit
sustainable and ethical so you can
attract the best people
you can sustain it because it's a
mission it's not just about the money
because it's diminishing returns to
making money there's diminishing
marginal utility and money in your life
so i learned that if you want to change
the world you're probably better off
trying to do it with a for-profit
