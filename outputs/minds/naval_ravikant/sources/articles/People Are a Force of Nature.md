what does the transforming is knowledge
we can take some raw material that had
no particular use
and within that raw material we might
find uranium nuclei which then can be
used in a nuclear reactor to create
energy
or bombs we can find within something
that
for almost the entire geological
existence of the earth
sat there inert and would have done
nothing absent
people people are the entities within
the universe that create
explanations they're able to explain
what raw materials
might be transformed into now what are
they transforming these raw materials
into
civilization people creating knowledge
end up becoming literally a force of
nature if we seek to explain
something like the shape of a galaxy or
the shape of the star
any astrophysicist will give you a story
based upon
the known laws of physics about how
gravity will pull things into spheres
how the laws of thermodynamics will
cause certain kinds of gas to heat up
and expand all of the known laws of
physics
are sufficient to explain what we see
out there in the cosmos
but the laws of physics alone will not
be able to explain the
appearance of manhattan you have to
invoke things other than
merely the fundamental laws of physics
you need to invoke
the existence of people and their
capacity to explain the world
scientifically philosophically
politically
because it's all of those things that
will come together to explain why we
have certain structures like skyscrapers
in manhattan this is a profound idea
that's an idea that
seems to have been overlooked by
scientists many of whom have a
reductionist idea about
how to explain what we see in our
environment
they will seek to explain only the
natural phenomena that are in our
environment
of course everyone wants to know how the
laws of nature work
but if we want to understand how the
universe
from this point onwards whether it's
locally on our own planet
eventually the solar system eventually
the galaxy is going to evolve over time
we're going to have to talk about the
knowledge that people create
and the choices that they're going to
make into the future this is a different
vision
of the place of people in the universe
