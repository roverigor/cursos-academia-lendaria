there's a phrase that you're going to
hear both brett and i use over and over
again
and that phrase is good explanations
good explanations
is deutsche's improvement upon the
scientific method
at the same time it's beyond science
it's not just true in science but in all
of life
we navigate our way through life and we
do it successfully by
creating good explanations if you take
away nothing else
try and understand what a good
explanation is
a good explanation first and foremost is
testifiable
falsifiable you can run some experiment
in the real world
to see if it's true or not stepping back
from that it's a creative explanation
it looks at something that's going on in
the real world and says this is why it's
happening
it is a creative leap that says this is
the underlying
explanation for how the thing works for
example when i talk to my young kids and
we're out watching the sunset
i keep telling them is the sun setting
is the sun going somewhere is the sun
moving
or is it maybe we're moving and we're
moving in such a way that it looks like
the sun is setting
which is the proper explanation because
looking at it naively you would think
the sun is hurtling across the sky and
there goes the sun again going around
the earth
but that may not be the only explanation
there is a completely creative
explanation
that seems to fly in the face of the
obvious observation of the sun's
movement but could also fit the facts
but it requires some creativity
and that creative explanation is that
the earth is rotating good explanations
don't have to be obvious they're not
derived from just looking at what
happened in the past
but they are testable there are
experiments we can run to figure out
is it the sun that is growing around the
earth or is it the earth turning
