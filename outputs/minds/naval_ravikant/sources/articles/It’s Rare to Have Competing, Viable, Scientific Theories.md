edition that's similar to bayesianism
isn't it in both cases they're assuming
that you can enumerate all the possible
theories but you can't because that's
the creativity coming in
it's very rare in science to have more
than one viable theory
in physics we mentioned newtonian theory
of gravity and there was general
relativity that's one of the rare
occasions where you actually have these
two competing theories
it's almost unknown to have three
competing theories what confuses people
is that induction
and bayesianism work really well for
finite constrained
spaces that are already known they're
not good for new explanations
bayesianism is i got new information i
used to wait the previous probability
predictions that i had
now i've changed my probability based on
the new data
so i believe that something different is
going to happen for example
i don't know if you remember the monty
hall show monty hall calls you up and
there's three doors and there's treasure
behind one of them and then two of them
don't have anything and you pick
which door it's going to be door number
one two or three then he opens one of
the other two doors and shows you
there's nothing behind it
now do you want to change your vote the
understanding of knife probability says
no i wouldn't change my vote why should
it matter
that one of the ones he showed me
doesn't have something the probability
should not have changed but
bayesianism says you've got new
information you should revise
your guess and you should switch the
other door and the easier way to say
that is imagine there were 100 doors
and then you picked one at random then
he opens
98 of the remaining 99 shows you there's
nothing now do you switch and
of course you'd want to switch because
what are the odds that you picked one of
the 100 in the first place
now your odds are in one and two and
people discover this
and say of course now i'm a smart
bayesian i can update
my priors based on new information
that's what smart people do and
therefore i'm a bayesian
but it in no way helps you discover new
knowledge or new explanations
that's the uncontroversial use of
bayesianism which is a very powerful
tool it's used in
medicine of trying to figure out which
of these medicines might be
more effective than others so there are
whole areas of mathematics like
bayesianism
which can be applied in science without
controversy at all
it's where we say that bayesianism is
the way in which we can generate
new explanations or the way in which we
can judge one explanation against
another in fact the way in which we
generate new explanations is
creativity and the way in which we judge
one explanation against another is
either
experimental refutation or
straightforward criticism
of realising that one of those
explanations is just a bad explanation
