the beginning of infinity is not an easy
book to read
to some level deutsche could not but
write for other physicists
he has a certain peer group that he
respects and who respect him
and he has to meet them at their level
so he has to write for other physicists
and philosophers
part of what i wanted to do was i wanted
to understand these principles in the
book
verify confirm them for myself or not i
love the old motto from the royal
society which says
nelius and verba which says take no
one's word for it
in other words figure it out yourself
that's the only way you know anything
so i wanted to confirm the principles in
the beginning of infinity or to refute
them for myself
so to do that i was reading and
rereading the book i started reading
some blog posts on it
and then eventually i found a guy online
named brett hall
and i started listening to his podcast
which was called talk cast but tok
cast for the theory of knowledge cast
and brett i'm going to let you introduce
yourself but i would say that
listening to your podcast has helped me
clarify a lot of these principles
and i would love to have you talk with
me
so that we can both understand the depth
the clarity
the reach the importance of these ideas
and then hopefully someone else out
there can become smarter
by it hello naval and it's great to be
here
you've raised so many interesting
aspects of the beginning of infinity
which has become a real passion of mine
like many people who enter into science
when i was at school i thought well i
want to be an astronomer when i enter
university i want to
go and do a physics degree do an
astronomy degree and then become a
professional astronomer
it wasn't until one day i was in a
bookstore and i found
this book called the fabric of reality
by david deutsch
and i started reading it and the first
chapter
described what i was trying to achieve
in my life it was putting
into words what i felt my university
studies
what my general outlook on life was
about because
david deutsch says there the ancient
philosophers thought that they could get
an understanding
of the entire world and then later on as
time passed
modern science made it seem as though
this was an impossible project there's
no way you could understand
everything about reality there's too
much to know how could you possibly know
everything
