## Article Content

Naval provides critical guidance on one of the most important decisions for any startup founder.

### Core Principle

> "Picking a co-founder is your most important decision. It's more important than your product, market, and investors."

### The Power of Two - The Ideal Founding Team

The ideal founding team has two key characteristics:
- **Two people** with a "history of working together"
- **Similar age and financial standing**
- **Mutual respect**
- **One founder good at building products**
- **One founder good at selling products**

### Critical Selection Criteria

Naval emphasizes several crucial factors when selecting a co-founder:

#### 1. Intelligence, Energy, and Integrity
- Not about who you grew up with
- Not about who you like most
- About finding someone with exceptional qualities

#### 2. Aligned Motives
- Founders must have shared goals
- > "If one founder wants to build a cool product, another one wants to make money, and yet another wants to be famous, it won't work"

#### 3. Complementary Skills
- One technical (builds)
- One strategic (sells)

### Warning Signs

- Don't settle if something feels wrong
- Avoid "overly rational short-term thinkers"
- Look for people who are "irrationally ethical"

### Practical Advice

- **Build in founder vesting**
- Be prepared to potentially lose a friendship to save the partnership
- Take time to truly know your potential co-founder

### Final Recommendation

> "If it doesn't feel right, keep looking. If you're compromising, keep looking."

### The Long-Term Perspective

The co-founder relationship is critical because:
- You'll spend more time with this person than anyone else
- They'll have equal say in major decisions
- The partnership quality directly affects company success
- A bad co-founder can destroy the business
