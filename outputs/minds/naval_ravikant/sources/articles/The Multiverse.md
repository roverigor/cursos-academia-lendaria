so we have to come to a deeper
understanding of how to explain
what is going on in this double state
experiment because
if we fire either a photon or an
electron at that double-slit apparatus
and we put
a detector at either of those slits then
we will detect a particle so we can
detect that we fired a particle
we can detect that a particle is going
through those slits
and we can detect a particle at the
projection screen as well
when you do this experiment in the
laboratory using electrons you can see
the dots where the electrons strike
hitting the screen but you don't get a
simple pattern that you would expect if
you're firing
cannon balls at a wall where there are
two holes in the wall
through which the cannonballs can go you
would expect that all the cannonballs
are going to go through those two holes
and land
in one of two positions behind the wall
but with particles
at the quantum level that's not what
happens
something is going on and the only
explanation
is that when we fire a photon there's
the photon that we can see
in our universe but there's also photons
in other universes
passing through the apparatus that we
cannot see and these
photons are able to interact with the
photon
that we are able to detect this is where
the concept of
interference comes in interference is an
old concept in physics
it goes back to waves waves certainly
interfere
but we need to understand the way in
which particles can interfere one with
another
particles that we can observe and
particles that we can only assume to
observe
given these experiments and this is why
we are forced
into acknowledging the existence of
these other particles
and not only these other particles but
other universes in which these particles
exist
