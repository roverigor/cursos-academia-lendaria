## Article Content

Naval discusses how the venture capital industry is being "unbundled" - breaking down the traditional VC model into separate components.

### The Traditional VC Bundle

Historically, Venture Capital was a bundle of three things:
1. **Money**
2. **Control**
3. **Advice**

### Changes Driving Unbundling

Changes in the startup ecosystem have disrupted this model:
- Reduced capital requirements
- More information available online (Venture Hacks and others helped entrepreneurs understand the control layer)
- Rise of seed incubators and angel investors
- Y Combinator and other seed incubators helped standardize documents and reduce VC control

### Key Transformations

- **Angels** often invest without seeking control (bundling just Advice and Money)
- **Seed funds** and some larger funds are more entrepreneur-friendly
- Emergence of "Seed Combinators" and "Pure Money" investment approaches

### Core Quote

> "Venture Capital is slowly being un-bundled, as mature industries often are."

### The New Landscape

The article argues that:
- Reputation and control matter less now
- Advice and signaling becoming the primary value propositions for investors
- However, the unique perspective of an experienced investor with strong incentives cannot be fully replaced by the new unbundled model

### Related Concept: VC Bundling (2005)

Naval had earlier established (December 2005) that Silicon Valley Venture Capital bundles Advice, Control, and Money. He argued that smart entrepreneurs in times of plenty, serial entrepreneurs, and those with profitable businesses break apart these bundles. He used Google as an example of successful unbundling.
