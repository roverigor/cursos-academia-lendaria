desire is a contract you make with
yourself to be unhappy until you get
what you want you start becoming
disturbed because you want something and
then you work really hard to get that
thing and you're miserable in the mean
time and then when you get that thing
you actually revert to the state you
were in before you had that thing it's
not like you get to some blissful peak
level that you stay on there's a
delusion that there's something out
there that will make me happy and
fulfill forever that is a complete
delusion no one thing seems to do that
we can talk later about enlightenment
and that does seem to head in that
direction of a permanent solution but
we're not gonna explore that just yet
we're just talking about common-sense
happiness there's no single permanent
solution to it rather it is a process of
understanding it is a process of
self-discovery is a process of training
yourself and seeing certain truths
if obtaining things were to permanently
make us happy
then the cavemen would have been
miserable and we should all be
deliriously happy right now so obviously
net happiness per person is not going up
it might even be going down modernity
probably brings more unhappiness than
pastimes so happiness is returning to
that state where nothing is missing in
this moment
