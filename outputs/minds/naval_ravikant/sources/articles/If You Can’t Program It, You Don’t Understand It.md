these are all uncertain hypotheses but
we also have to keep in mind that
there's so much about evolution by
natural selection we don't know david
deutch has this little quip if you can't
program it you don't understand it which
means in the case of agi we can't
program agi that means we don't
understand what this idea of general
intelligence that we have is and the
same happens to be true of evolution by
natural selection there are these things
called evolutionary algorithms but this
is not programming evolution by natural
selection this is not being able to
create artificial entities inside of a
computer that when subject to actual
environmental pressures are able to
evolve towards this increasing
complexity
