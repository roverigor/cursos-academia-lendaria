the difference with the beginning of
infinity you're getting a world view
you're not being given the standard take
from physicists about how to understand
quantum theory you're not being given
the standard take
of how to understand knowledge from
philosophers and you're certainly not
being given the standard take of how to
understand mathematics from
mathematicians
deutsche is qualified in all these areas
he's expert in all these areas
so the world view itself what's at the
core of it deutsche's world view is that
reality is comprehensible problems are
soluble
it's a deeply rationally optimistic
worldview
it believes in good explanations good
scientific explanations and progress
progress is inevitable as long as we
have these good explanations
good explanations have tremendous reach
they are acts of creativity
humans are problem solvers and can solve
all problems
all sins and evil are due to a lack of
knowledge
one can be optimistic about constant
progress
that's what the title the beginning of
infinity refers to that we're the
beginning of an
infinite series of progress it's a very
optimistic take it believes that we are
at home in the universe the universe is
ours as a resource to
learn about and exploit that material
wealth is a set of physical
transformations that we can affect that
everything that is not forbidden by the
laws of physics
is eventually possible through knowledge
and knowledge creation
he also talks about how humans are
universal explainers
that anything that can be known and
understood can be known and understood
by human beings in the
computation power of a human system it's
all knowable
it's all noble by humans we're the
beginning of an
infinity of knowledge and as we
understand things
using good explanations and we create
new theories that are constantly being
destroyed and replaced by better ones
there's no end point in sight there's no
perfection every theory can be falsified
and improved that we are on our way to
being able to do
everything that is not forbidden by the
laws of physics
