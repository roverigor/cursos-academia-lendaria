there are two other scientific thinkers
that i like who are unrelated to david
deutsch
but come to very similar conclusions one
is nasim taleb who's popularized the
idea of the black swan
which is that no number of white swans
disproves the existence of a black swan
you can never conclusively say all swans
are white you can never
establish final truth all you can do is
work with the best explanation you have
today
which is still better than ignorance far
better but
at any time a black swan can show up and
disprove your theory
and then you have to go find a better
one the other fellow who i find
fascinating is
gregory chaitan he is a mathematician
who is very much in the curt girdle vein
where he tries to explore the limits and
boundaries of what is possible in
mathematics
one of the points that he makes is that
godel's incompleteness theorem
doesn't say that mathematics is junk
it's not a cause for
despair gordo's incompleteness theorem
says that no formal
system including mathematics it can be
both complete and correct
either there are statements that are
true that cannot be proven true in the
system or there will be a contradiction
somewhere inside the system
so this could be a cause of despair for
mathematicians who view
mathematics as this abstract perfect
fully self-contained thing but chetan
makes the argument that actually
it opens up for creativity in
mathematics it means that even in
mathematics
you are always one step away from
falsifying something and then finding a
better explanation for it
it puts humans and their creativity and
their ability to find good explanations
back at the core of it
at some deep level mathematics is still
an art there's very useful things that
come out of mathematics and you're still
building an edifice of knowledge
but there is no such thing as conclusive
settled truth there is no subtle science
there is no settled mathematics there
are good explanations that will be
replaced over time
with more good explanations that explain
more of the world
this is something that we inherit from
our schooling more than anything else
it's part of our academic culture
and breeds into the wider culture as
well people have this idea
that mathematics is this pristine area
of knowledge
where what has proved to be true is
certainly true
then you have science which doesn't give
you certain truth but you can be
highly confident in what you discover
you can use experiments to confirm
that what you're saying appears to be
correct but you might be wrong
and then of course there's philosophy
which is a mere matter of opinion
this is the hierarchy that some people
inherit from school
mathematics are certain science is
almost certain and the rest of it is
more or less a matter of opinion
this is what deutsch calls the
mathematician's misconception
is that mathematicians have this
intuitive way
of realizing that their proof their
theorem
that they've reached by this method of
proof is absolutely certainly true
in fact it's a confusion between
the subject matter and our knowledge of
the subject matter
