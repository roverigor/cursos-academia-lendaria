are there any other micro economic
concepts outside of zero marginal cost
of replication and scale economies that
you think are important for people to
understand
I think price discrimination is an
important thing to understand that what
it means is that you can charge people
different things based on their
propensity to pay now you're legally not
allowed charge different people
different things just because you don't
like them you have to offer them a
little something extra but it has to be
something that rich people care about
business class seats will routinely cost
five or ten times what an economy class
seat does but it probably cost the
airline just two maybe three acts to
provide that it's just the rich person
is more willing to pay so you have to
give them just the little things that
they need extra to either signal they're
rich or that little bit of comfort that
they want so price discrimination gets
to use a lot and enterprise software
where you have a freemium product the
free version will do almost everything
but then if you want the version that's
a little extra secure or hosted on your
site or has multi-user administration
purposes so the IT person can monitor
everything that's going on you're
suddenly find yourself paying 10 100 or
infinite times as much as you go from a
free product to a price product
