there are a lot of institutions in our
society today that are relying upon
credibility stamps they used to be how
you gain credibility in society so if
you were a journalist writing for the
new york times or washington post then
you had the masthead of the new york
times and washington post if you're a
professor at harvard you have
credibility because you're professor
harvard so of course those systems got
hacked a lot of social scientists who
have no business telling the world what
to do are now in there with their
nonsense political models masquerading
as economists or natural scientists or
you have people who are activists
writing under the mastheads of these
formerly great newspapers and burning up
the credibility capital that these
newspapers have built up over time the
internet is exposing them slowly but
steadily and we're going through a
transition phase where the masses still
believe in the institutions and we're
caught in this shelling point this
coordination point for the institutions
how do i know if i should hire you will
you have a diploma from harvard i know
it's not as good as it used to be i know
harvard humanities diploma is probably
nonsense at this point but i don't have
any other credibility metric to filter
you and i need to do it in an efficient
way what we're seeing is the transition
of power from institutions to
individuals but it's going to be messy
it's going to take a couple of
generations or at least a generation and
in the meantime the institutions are
fighting back we're in the empire
strikes back phase where they're trying
to take over the new platforms like
twitter facebook and patreon which
empower the individuals the university
in all of academia has a very big stick
in terms of being able to train their
own next generation of teachers who then
go on to teach the next generation of
primary and secondary school students
yeah it's a priesthood you're only
allowed to say what the priests have
approved and you can only say that if
you're yourself a priest and the priest
gets to decide who's a priest
