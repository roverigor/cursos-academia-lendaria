there are many scientists philosophers
who've talked about this concept of a
multiverse but this is a very strict
very sober understanding of what a
multiverse is all of these universes in
this multiverse
obey the same laws of physics we're not
talking about universes where there are
other laws of physics this should be no
more surprising than historically when
it used to be thought to be the universe
consisted of
our planet and around our planet orbited
everything else
other planets stars the sun the moon
orbited around us
existed on this tiny planet then our
vision of reality got expanded a little
bit we realized in fact we were not at
the center of the universe
the sun was at the center and these
other planets were in fact bigger
in some cases in the case of jupiter and
saturn and the gas giants
bigger than what our planet earth is the
sun was a lot bigger than what we are so
our universe became larger
then we realized that we were just one
star system among many in a huge galaxy
of
hundreds of billions of stars then later
we realized that this galaxy is one of
hundreds of billions of galaxies so the
history
of ideas and the history of science is a
history of
us broadening our vision of exactly how
large
physical reality is and this is another
step in that general trend
and we should expect it to continue it
shouldn't be that
hard for people to accept that this is
the way to understand things
do we know everything about quantum
theory and how this multiverse works
no we haven't united this multiverse
with general relativity we need a space
time or a geometry
of the multiverse which we don't have
yet
