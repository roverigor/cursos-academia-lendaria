in one of your tweets you listed out
some of the things you should study like
programming sales reading writing
arithmetic one of the items that ended
up on the cutting room floor was that
you should also study ethics I was
originally going to put that out there
as a concession to people who believe
that making money is evil and that the
only way to make it is evil but then I
realize Efex is not necessarily
something you study it's something you
think about and is something you do
every one of us has a personal moral
code and where you got that moral code
from is different for everybody it's not
like I can point you to a textbook sure
I could point to some Roman and Greek
texts but that's not gonna suddenly make
you ethical there's the golden rule
right do unto others as you would have
them do unto you or there's nothing
Talib silver rule which is don't do unto
others which you don't want them doing
unto you once you've been in business
long enough you will realize how much of
business is about trust and it's about
trust because you want a compound
interest you want to be able to work for
a long period of time with trustworthy
people without having to reevaluate
every discussion with that and we
rethink each time and without having to
constantly look over your shoulder and
so over time you gravitate towards
working with certain kinds of people and
similarly those people will gravitate
towards working with other ethical quote
unquote people so being ethical turns
out to be a selfish imperative you want
to be ethical because it attracts the
other long-term players in the network
and then they want to do business with
you and if you build a good enough
reputation for being ethical eventually
people will pay you just to do deals
through you because you're the one who
will validate and insure the deals by
your presence because you wouldn't be
involved with low-quality stuff so being
ethical actually pays off in the long
run but it's the very long run in the
short run being unethical pays off which
is why so many people go for it it's a
greedy algorithm but you can be ethical
simply because you're long-term greedy
and I can even outline a framework for
different parts of so-called ethics just
based on the idea of long term
selfishness for example you want to be
honest because it leaves you with a
clear mind you don't have two threads
running in your head one is the lies
that you told it to keep track of and
the other one is what you're saying
just have to think about one thing at a
time so you have more energy to think
about that things your clear thinker
also by being honest you're rejecting
the people who only want to hear the
pretty lies so you forced those people
out of your network and sometimes it's
painful like friends and family but
long-term you create room for the people
who like you exactly the way that you
are so that is a selfish reason to be
honest for example in negotiations if
you're the kind of person who always
tries to get the best deal for yourself
you will win a lot of very early deals
and it'll feel very good but on the
other hand there are a few people who
will recognize that you're always
scrabbling and not acting fairly and
they will tend to avoid you over time
those people end up being the deal
makers in the network because people go
to them for a fair shake or to figure
out what's fair and so if you are
cutting people fair deals you don't get
paid in the short term but in the long
term everybody wants to deal with you
and you end up being a market hub you
have more information you have trust you
have reputation and people end up doing
deals through you a lot of wisdom is
just realized in the long-term
consequences of your actions and so the
longer term you're willing to look the
wiser that you're going to seem to
everybody around you
