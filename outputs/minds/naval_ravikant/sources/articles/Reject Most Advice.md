regarding the guy that gets rich in five
years one of the tweets that you had on
the cutting room floor was avoid people
who got rich quickly they're just giving
you their winning lottery ticket numbers
this is generally true of advice anyway
which is it's back to Scott Adams
systems not goals if you ask a specific
person what works for them very often
it's just like they're reading out the
exact set of things that work for them
which may not be applicable for you
they're just reading your winning
lottery ticket numbers it's a little
glib there is something to be learned
from them but you can't just take their
exact circumstance and map it onto yours
the best founders I know they listen and
read to everyone but then they ignore
everybody and they make up their own
mind they have their own internal model
of how to apply things to their
situation and they do not hesitate to
discard information if you survey enough
people all the advice will cancel the
zero so you do have to have your own
point of view and when something is set
your way you have to very quickly decide
is that true is that true outside of the
context of what that person applied it
in is it true in my context and then do
I want to apply it you have to reject
most advice but you have to listen to
and read enough of it to know what to
reject and what to accept even in this
podcast you should examine everything if
something does not feel true to you put
it down set it aside if too many things
seem untrue delete this podcast I think
the most dangerous part of taking advice
is that the person that gave it to you
is not going to be around to tell you
when it doesn't apply any longer yet I
view the purpose of advice as a little
different than most people I just view
it as helping me have anecdotes and
Maxim's
that I can then later recall when I have
my own direct experience and say ah
that's what that person meant 90% of my
tweets are actually just Maxim's that I
carve for myself there are then little
mental hooks to remind me when I'm in
that situation again like oh I'm the one
who tweeted if you can't see yourself
working with someone for life then don't
work with them for a day so as soon as I
know that this person is not going to be
someone that I'm gonna be working with
10 years from now
I have to start extricating myself in
that relationship or just not investing
that much more effort into it so I use
my tweets and other people's tweets as
Maxim's that help compress my own
learnings and be able to recall them
because you know the brain space is
finite your finite neurons so you can
almost think of these as pointers
addresses mnemonics to help you remember
deep-seated principles where you have
the underlying experience to back it up
if you don't have the underlying
experience then it just reads a good
collection of quotes it's like it's cool
it's inspirational for a moment maybe
you make a nice poster out of it but
then you forget it and move on so all of
these are really just compact ways for
you to recall your own knowledge
