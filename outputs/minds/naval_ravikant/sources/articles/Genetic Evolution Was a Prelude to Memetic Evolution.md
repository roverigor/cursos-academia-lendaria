in fact i've got behind me poppa's book
called objective knowledge and it's
subtitled an evolutionary approach and
that's no accident at all either there's
symmetry between the theory of
epistemology and the theory of evolution
as we understand it before we understood
what is known as the darwinian theory of
evolution the only idea that people had
was these entities had to be created all
the plants and animals that you see
around you had to be created by a
creator there was no explanatory
mechanism some people came up with the
idea of gradual change over time lamarck
was one such the reason why giraffes
have long necks is because their
ancestors had slightly shorter necks so
they tried to stretch their necks to
reach the leaves they couldn't reach but
again there was no mechanism for this
beyond the fact that an individual goes
off to the gymnasium and works on their
biceps and their biceps get a little
bigger over time although you can work
out in the gym and increase the size of
your biceps that doesn't mean your
children are going to inherit those
characteristics so what darwin came up
with is a similar idea to what papa had
in knowledge it was error correction the
idea that an organism would trial itself
out in a particular environment and if
it wasn't as we say fit for that
environment then it would die off but if
it was fit in that environment then it
would survive so you have this encounter
with reality between
living organisms and the environment and
it's the environment that's giving you
feedback from reality and destroying
those organisms that aren't fit enough
to survive the neo-darwinist view is to
give us what the unit of selection is
it's not the group or the herd it's not
even the individual it's the gene it's
the selfish gene id which comes to us
from richard dawkins who says if any one
of those genes happens to be not fit for
the particular environment that could
cause the death of that organism but the
species might not go extinct the species
might survive but its entire dna will
ever so subtly change over time as the
environment changes and now we
have leveled that up we human beings are
the next step in that evolutionary
process where we can create explanatory
knowledge which does the same thing
deutsch likes to say genetic evolution
was merely a prelude what's coming next
is mimetic evolution the history of the
universe from here on out is going to be
the history of ideas undergoing the same
evolutionary process as what the genes
did previously
