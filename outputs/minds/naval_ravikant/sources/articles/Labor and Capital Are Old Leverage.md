so why don't we talk a little bit about
leverage the first tweet in the storm
was a famous quote from Archimedes which
was give me a lever long enough and a
place to stand and I will move the earth
the next tweet was fortunes require
leverage business leverage comes from
capital people and products with no
marginal costs of replication leverage
is critical the reason I stuck in
Archimedes quote in there is normally I
don't like putting other people's quotes
in my Twitter like that doesn't add any
value you can go look up those people's
quotes but this court I had to put in
there because it's just so fundamental I
read it when I was very very young and
it had a huge impression on me and we
all know what leverage is when we use a
seesaw or a lever we understand how that
works physically but I think what our
brains aren't really well evolved to
comprehend is how much leverage is
possible in modern society and what the
newest forms of leverage are and so the
oldest form of leverage is labor which
is people working for you so instead of
me lifting rocks I can have ten people
lift rocks then just by my guidance and
where the rock should go a lot more
rocks get moved and I could do myself
everybody understands this because we're
evolved to understand the laborer form
of leverage and so what happens is
society over values labor as a form of
leverage this is why your parents are
impressed when you get a promotion and
you have lots of people working
underneath you this is why when a lot of
naive people we tell them about your
company they'll say how many people work
there they'll use that as a way to
establish credibility they're trying to
measure how much leverage and impact you
actually have or when someone starts a
movement they'll say how many people
they have or how big the army is we just
automatically assume that more people is
better but I would argue that this is
the worst form of leverage that you
could possibly use managing other people
is incredibly messy it requires
tremendous leadership skills you're one
short hop from a mutiny or getting eaten
or torn apart by the mob it's incredibly
competed over entire civilizations have
been destroyed over this fight for
example communism Marxism is all about
the battle between capital and labor Das
Kapital on that's labor right so it's
kind of a trap so you really want to
stay out of labor based leverage you
want the minimum amount of people
working with
that are going to allow you to use the
other forms of leverage but achar you're
much more interesting the second type of
leverage is capital and this one's a
little less hardwired into us because
large amounts of money moving around and
being saved and being invested in money
markets these are inventions of human
beings the last few hundred to few
thousand years they're not evolved with
us from hundreds of thousands of years
so we understand them a little bit less
well they probably require more
intelligence to use correctly and the
ways in which we use them keep changing
management skills from 100 years ago
might still apply today but investing in
the stock market skills from 100 years
ago probably don't apply to the same
level today so capital is a trickier
form of leverage to use for modern it's
the one that people have used to get
fabulously wealthy in the last century
it's probably been the dominant form of
leverage in the last century and you can
see this by the richest people
it's bankers politicians and corrupt
countries who print money especially
people who move large amounts of money
around and if you look at the top of
very large companies outside of
technology companies in many many large
old companies the CEO job is really a
financial job they're really financial
asset managers now sometimes an asset
measuring can put a pleasant face on it
so you get a Warren Buffett type but
deep down I think we all dislike capital
as a form of leverage because it feels
unfair because it's this invisible thing
that can be accumulated and passed
across generations and suddenly seems to
result in people having gargantuan
amounts of money with nobody else kind
of around them or necessarily sharing in
it that said Capital is a powerful form
of leverage it can be converted to
labour it can be converted to other
things
it's very surgical very analytical if
you are a brilliant investor and give a
billion dollars and you can make a 30
percent return with it where anybody
else can only make a 20 percent return
you're gonna get all the money and
you're gonna get paid very handsomely
for it it scales very very well if you
get good at managing capital you can
manage more and more capital much more
easy they can manage more and more
people so it is a good form of leverage
but the hard part of capital is how do
you obtain it and that's why I talked
about specific knowledge and
accountability first if you have
specific knowledge in a domain and if
your account
and you have a good name in that domain
then people are going to give you
capital as a form of leverage that you
can use to then go get more capital so
the capital also is fairly well
understood and I think a lot of the
knocks against capitalism come because
of the accumulation of capital
