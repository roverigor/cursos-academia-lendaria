you summarized this entire tweet storm
with two words productize yourself
productize and yourself yourself has
uniqueness productize has leverage
yourself has accountability productize
has specific knowledge yourself also has
specific knowledge in there so all of
these pieces you can combine them into
these two words whenever you're doing
anything in business if you're looking
towards a long term of getting wealthy
you should ask yourself is this
authentic to me is it myself that I am
projecting and then am i productizing it
am i scaling it am i scaling with labor
or with capital or with code or with
media so it's a very handy simple
mnemonic I mean what is this podcast
this is a podcast called nevah land
literally productizing myself with a
podcast you want to figure out what
you're uniquely good at or what you
uniquely are and apply as much leverage
as possible so making money isn't even
something you do it's not a skill it's
who you are
stamped out a million times making money
should be a function of your identity
and what you like to do another tweet
that I really liked was this was not
mine somebody else put this up they said
find three hobbies one that makes you
money one that keeps you fit and one
that makes you creative I would change
that slightly so I would say one that
makes you money one that makes you fit
and one that makes you smarter so in my
case my hobbies would be reading making
money I love working with startups
either investing in them brainstorming
them starting them I just love that
ideation and initial creation phase
around startups and then on the hobby
that keeps you fit I don't really have
one closest thing I have is yoga but
that's where I sort of fell apart and I
think people who early in life discover
something like surfing or swimming or
tennis or some kind of a sport that they
continue doing throughout most of their
life are very lucky because they found a
hobby that'll make them fit
