now that's one argument and we have to
be humble in the face of uncertainty
here no one knows but i want to give an
argument that rarely gets any air time
the argument is that we are alone and
the argument has nothing to do with
astronomy it has everything to do with
biology the argument goes like this
look at planet earth and look at the
number of species not only that exist
right now
millions of them but the number of
species that have ever existed on planet
earth
hundreds of millions
when life arose
something like three and a half billion
years ago
for about
two and a half billion years for most of
the history of life on earth there was
nothing but bacteria
so life apparently doesn't have much
impetus to evolve quickly beyond
bacteria it just remains as simple as
possible
a lot of people have this misconceived
idea
that darwin really did away with the
idea that evolution has a direction in
mind
you see these pictures of evolution that
appear in high school textbooks of the
monkey that's hobbling around on all
fours and he's hunched over and then
eventually he's standing up and holding
a briefcase as if this is what evolution
had in mind it only seems to be what
evolution had in mind in retrospect by
looking backwards this american academic
his name is charlie lineweaver and he
calls this the planet of the apes
hypothesis as if if you removed the
humans from a planet the apes would
naturally
evolve to fill the intelligence niche
and he said you could imagine another
situation where you're an elephant that
is able to think about themselves and
they reflect on the length of their
trunk and they look back through
biological evolution and they see that
trunks get ever shorter so what they
conclude is ah evolution has been
geared towards making ever longer trunks
that's what evolution is all about of
course we can see that that's ridiculous
it just happens to be the case that this
creature called the elephant has evolved
and it's got this long trunk but length
of trunk doesn't appear to be a
convergent feature of evolution so we
say
a convergent feature of evolution is a
feature that exists within
biological entities which has arisen
again and again independently
wings is my favorite example
fish have wings of certain kind there's
flying fish butterflies have wings so
we've got them in insects they arose in
mammals as well with flying foxes and
certain kinds of possums and of course
birds and dinosaurs had wings as well so
independently in all these species the
wings keep on arising so do eyes so do
organs for sound
but now let's think about the capacity
to do mathematics or to build radio
telescopes in other words to be an
intelligent creative species how many
times has that arisen on geological
history of the earth in one species and
one species alone
can we conclude on that basis that
therefore it's inevitable that
intelligent species will arise if you
were to repeat the experiment by
sprinkling a little bit of bacteria
around all the
bio-friendly planets that exist
throughout the universe would you be
guaranteed to get a entity like us
