i was very pleasantly surprised a couple
of years back
that i reopened an old book which i had
read or i thought i'd read about a
decade ago called the beginning of
infinity
by david deutsch sometimes you read a
book
and it makes a difference right away
sometimes you read a book and you don't
understand it then you read it later at
the right time and it makes a difference
this time when i reopened this book and
i went through it much more carefully
than i had in the past
meticulously rather than reading it to
read it and to say i was done reading it
i read it to understand the concepts and
the topics and stopped at every point
where something was new
it completely started reforming my
worldview
it changed the way that i think and i
would credit this book as being
probably the only book in the last
decade except maybe a few of nasim
teleb's works and
maybe one or two other scatter books
that i feel
made me smarter they literally expanded
the way that i think they expanded not
just the repertoire of my knowledge but
the repertoire of my
reasoning people throw around words like
mental models a lot
and i find most mental models not worth
reading or thinking about or listening
to
because i find them trivial however the
mental models that came out of the
beginning of infinity are
transformational
because they very convincingly
completely change the way that you look
at what is true and what is not
karl popper laid out the theory of what
is scientific and what is not
what is a good explanation what is not
and what deutsch does is he
expands on that dramatically in the
beginning of infinity but even that is
to do it a disservice
the wide-ranging nature of what he
covers in the beginning of infinity
is incredible he goes from the theory of
knowledge which goes by the fancy word
epistemology
all the way to quantum mechanics and
physics and multiverse theory
to infinity and mathematics to the reach
of what is noble and what is not
knowable
universal explanations the theory of
computation what is beauty what systems
of politics works better
how to raise your children these are all
encompassing
long-range philosophical ideas
