there is a video on youtube which has
deutsch explain the famous quantum
double slit experiment
which is about particle wave duality is
light a particle or a wave
you pass it through a slit depending on
whether there's observer and
interference or not it ends up in a wave
pattern ends up as individual photons
and this is the famous experiment which
has baffled people for a long time and
caused them to revise their world view
the one that led einstein's who say god
does not play dice with the universe
correct einstein was a realist at the
time when the founders of quantum theory
were trying to develop a
good explanation of what precisely was
going on
with these experiments in quantum theory
einstein
rejected all of them on the basis that
they weren't realistic and he was right
to do so
because none of them made any sense and
to this day none of the other
alternatives make any sense now einstein
didn't know about
the multiverse we had to wait until hugh
everett in the 1950s
was able to devise a simple realistic
way of understanding
quantum theory but if i go back to this
idea of the double state experiment
it is often claimed that particles have
a duality to them sometimes their
particles and sometimes their waves the
electron for example
given certain experiments will behave
like a particle and in other experiments
it behaves
like a wave people who hear this think
well okay that kind of explains
what's going on for example in the
photoelectric effect you shine a light
at electrons which literally means
you're firing a photon a particle of
light
at an electron and you can knock the
electron out of the atom
this is supposed to be proof positive
that light in the form of photons
and electricity in the form of electrons
are both particles
because they're bouncing off one another
and this is what particles do waves
don't do that
you watch water waves at the beach
you'll see they pass through each other
they don't bounce off one another
waves will bounce off particles but they
won't bounce off each other
prior to young's twin slit experiment we
actually relied upon
newton's ideas of light and newton's
idea was that
light was corpuscular as he said which
means made of particles
and then young came along and he shone a
light through
two slits cut into a piece of paper and
what you
find when you project that light onto
another sheet of paper
is not just two beams of light
you find what's called an interference
pattern where the light has interfered
with itself in the same way that when
waves pass through small apertures
natural geological gaps
they will interfere with one another
they produce crests in some places and
troughs in others
they can cancel each other out this was
supposed to be proof
to some of the early physicists that
light in fact was a wave
and now we get to quantum theory and we
find that things
we thought were certainly particles like
electrons when we do the same experiment
with them
they interfere with one another so it
appears as though we've got
particles acting like waves and waves
acting like particles
the resolution to this is not to admit
nonsense so this is what often is
explained in quantum theory lectures
in undergraduate level is that you have
to accept that something like a photon
is born as a particle it lives
as a wave and then it dies again as a
particle which
is nonsense and the reason it's nonsense
is because the photon doesn't know that
it's alive and it's dead it doesn't know
what experiment it's participating in
