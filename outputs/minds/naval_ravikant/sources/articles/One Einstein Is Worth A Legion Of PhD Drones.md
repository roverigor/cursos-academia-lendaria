china keeps on graduating more bachelor
of science and bachelor of engineers
than anywhere else in the world we're
lagging behind china because their
universities are pumping out more
science graduates they're not pumping
out more innovators it's not like the
students that are coming out of those
universities in china with their science
degrees are going off and doing phds and
doing innovative stuff quite the
opposite because they've been trained in
a particular way because they've been
trained to memorize this textbook
respond to this exam and they actually
can't think outside of the box they've
been trained that this is what's true
this is the unquestioned correct way of
thinking about science and that might be
good for being able to imitate as we see
but it's not going to be the thing that
enables you to push forward the frontier
in technology let alone fundamental
physics or anywhere else so i don't care
what the statistics are on how many
science graduates they've got that makes
no difference give me
10 innovative creative young physics
graduates over 50 000 physics graduates
that all are able to pass the exam with
a hundred percent efficiency any day
yeah one einstein is worth a legion of
drones with phds in physics
it doesn't matter creativity by its
nature goes zero to one and no amount of
throwing bodies at the problem will get
you there that's just the nature of
mimetic evolution and it's just the
nature of creativity
