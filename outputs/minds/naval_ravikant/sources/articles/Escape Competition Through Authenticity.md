this reminds me of your tweet about
escaping competition through
authenticity it sounds like part of this
is a search for who you are it's both a
search and a recognition because
sometimes when we search our egos we
want to be something that we aren't and
our friends and family are better at
telling us actually who we are or
looking back at what we've done is a
better indicator of who we are Peter
teal talks a lot about how competition
is besides the point it's
counterproductive we're highly mimetic
creatures we copy what everybody else is
doing around us we copy our desires from
them everyone around me is a great
artist I want to be an artist if
everyone around me is a great business
person I want to be a business person
everybody around me as a social
activists I want to be a social activist
that's where my self-esteem will come
from you have to be a little careful
when you get caught up into these status
games that you end up competing over
things that aren't worth competing over
so Peter Thiel talks about how he was
gonna be a law clerk because he was in
law school everybody around him wanted
to be a law clerk for a Supreme Court
justice or some famous judge and he got
rejected and that's what made him go
into business so it helped him break out
of a lesser game into a greater game so
sometimes you just get trapped in the
wrong game because you're competing and
the best way to escape competition to
get away from the specter of competition
which is not just stressful and
nerve-wracking but will often Drive you
to just the wrong answer the way to
escape competition is to just be
authentic to yourself if you are
fundamentally building and marketing
something that is just an extension of
who you are no one can compete with you
on that
who's gonna compete with Joe Rogan or
Scott Adams it's impossible it's
somebody else gonna come along and write
a better Dilbert no it's someone going
to compete with Bill Watterson and
create a better Calvin and Hobbes no
there being authentic this is easiest to
see in art artists are by definition all
naturally authentic but even
entrepreneurs are authentic who's gonna
be Elon Musk who's gonna be Jack Dorsey
these people are authentic and the
businesses and products they create are
authentic to their desires and their
means if somebody else came along and
started launching rockets I don't think
would phase Elon one bit he's still
gonna get to Mars because that's his
mission you know insane as it seems
that's the one he set for himself and
he's gonna accomplish it so authenticity
naturally gets you away from competition
it doesn't mean that you necessarily
want to be authentic to the point where
there's no product market fit it may
turn out you're the best juggler on the
unicycle but maybe there just isn't that
much of a market for that even with
YouTube videos so you gotta adjust that
somehow until you find product market
fit but at least lean towards
authenticity towards getting away from
competition and competition
automatically leads towards copycatting
and often towards just playing
completely the wrong game especially an
entrepreneurship the masses are never
right if you see a lot of people
tweeting about what a great market to
enter is or you see journalists talking
about a company is terrible they don't
know anything if the masses knew how to
build great things and create great
wealth we'd already be done we'd already
be rich by now so in a sense when you
see a lot of competition sometimes that
indicates to you that the masses are
already here so it's already competed
over too much and there's nothing here
or it's in the wrong trend to begin with
on the other hand if it's completely
empty if the whole market is empty and
no one's there that can also be a
warning indicator that you've gone too
authentic and not enough on the product
market fit part of founder product
market fit so there's a balance you have
to find it but generally most people
will make the mistake of paying too much
attention to the competition and being
too much like the competition and not
being authentic enough and the great
founders tend to be authentic
iconoclasts I hate to bring up the scott
adams skill stack one more time but I'll
still bring it up do you think one way
of getting to authenticity is not
necessarily like adding some random
skills that you think might be important
but just really finding like five or six
various skills that you already
authentically do and just stacking them
on top of each other and not even in any
purposeful way if you are expressing who
you are you're going to be expressing
all these little five or six different
skills anyway that's really where life
is going to lead you anyway long term if
you are good and successful at what you
do you will find that whatever your
hobbies were you're almost doing them
for a living as Robert Frost said you
know combine your vocation and your ab
what you love to do in what you do do so
I think you'll find yourself there
anyway and you're right about the skill
stack and that everyone's got multiple
skills we aren't all one-dimensional
creatures even though that's how we have
to portray ourselves and our online
profiles to get employed you meet
somebody and they say I'm a banker or
I'm a bartender or I'm a barber or what
have you all the B's but people are
multivariate they have a lot of skills
one banker might be going to finance
another one might be good sales the
third one might be just good at
macroeconomic trends and have a feel for
the markets another one might be really
good at picking individual stocks you
know another one might just be good at
maintaining relationships rather than
selling new relationships so everyone's
gonna have their various niches and you
can have multiple niche it's not gonna
be just one so over time you will find
as you go through your career both you
will gravitate towards the things that
you're good at which by definition are
almost the things you enjoyed doing
otherwise you wouldn't be good at them
you wouldn't have put in the time and
other people will push you towards the
things that you're good at because
you're smart bosses and you're smart
co-workers and you're smart investors
will realize okay you're really
world-class and this thing we can
recruit somebody else for that other
thing so ideally you want to end up
specializing in being you
