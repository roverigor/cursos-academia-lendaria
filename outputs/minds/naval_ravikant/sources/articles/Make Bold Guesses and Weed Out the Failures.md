going even further it's not just science
when we look at innovation
and technology and building for example
everything that thomas edison did and
nikola tesla did
these were from trial and error which is
creative guesses and trying things out
if you look at how evolution works
through variation and then natural
selection where it tries a lot of random
mutations and it filters out the ones
that didn't work
so this seems to be a general model
through which all complex systems
improve themselves over time
they make bold guesses and then they
weed out the things that didn't work
things like a beautiful symmetry to it
across all knowledge creation
it's ultimately an act of creativity we
don't know where it comes from and it's
not just a mechanical extrapolation of
observations
the most famous example on this we
mentioned black swans we talked about
boiling water
but the fun and easy one is the turkey
you could have a turkey that's being fed
very well every single day and fattened
up and it thinks that it belongs and
lives in a benevolent household
where the farmer comes and feeds it
every day until thanksgiving arrives and
then it's in for a very rude
awakening or i should say an ending that
shows you the limits of induction
precisely the theories have to be
guessed and
all of our great scientists have always
made noises
similar to this it's only the
philosophers or certain mathematicians
who think that this is the way that
science happens that it's this inductive
trend seeking way of extrapolating from
past observations into the future
einstein said that he wasn't necessarily
brighter than most other people it's
that he was
passionately interested in particular
problems and he had a
curiosity and an imagination imagination
was key for him
he needed to imagine what could possibly
explain these things he wasn't looking
at
past phenomena in order to come up with
general relativity he was
seeking to explain certain problems that
existed in physics
induction wasn't a part of it good
explanations
rely on creativity these good
explanations testable and falsifiable of
course but they are hard to vary
and they make risky and narrow
predictions that's a good guiding point
for anybody who is listening to this
podcast and trying to figure out
how they can incorporate this in their
everyday life your best theories are
going
to be creative guesses not simple
extrapolations
