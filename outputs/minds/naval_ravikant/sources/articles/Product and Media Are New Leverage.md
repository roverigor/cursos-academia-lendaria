the most interesting and the most
important form of leverage is this idea
of products that have no marginal cost
of replication this is the new form of
leverage this was only invented in the
last few hundred years it got started
with the printing press and accelerated
broadcast media and now it's really
blown up with the internet and with code
so now you can multiply your efforts
without having to involve other humans
and without needing money from other
humans this podcast is a form of
leverage long ago I would have had to
sit in a lecture hall and lecture each
of you personally and I would have maybe
reached a few hundred people and that
would have been that 30 years ago I
would have to be lucky to get on TV
which is somebody else's leverage they
would have distorted the message that
would taken the economics out of it or
charged me for it they would have
muddled the message and I would have
been lucky to get that form of leverage
but today thanks to the internet I can
buy a cheap microphone hook it up to a
laptop or an iPad and there you are all
listening
so this newest form of leverage is where
all the new fortunes were made so all
the new billionaires the last generation
fortunes were made by capital that was a
warren buffett's of the world but the
new generation fortunes are all made
through code or media Joe Rogan making
50 to 100 million bucks a year from his
podcast PewDiePie I don't know how much
money he's rolling in but he's bigger
than the news right the fortnight
players of course Jeff Bezos and Mark
Zuckerberg and Larry Page and Sergey
Brin and Bill Gates and Steve Jobs that
is all code based leverage now the
beauty is when you combine all of these
three that's where tech startups really
excel where you take just the minimum
but highest output labor that you can
get which are engineers and designers
product developers and then you add in
capital use that for marketing
advertising scaling and you add in lots
of code and media and podcasts and
content to get it all out there that is
a magic combination and that's why you
see technology startups explode out of
nowhere use massive leverage and just
make huge outside returns if you want to
talk a little bit about permissioned
versus permissionless probably the most
interesting thing to keep in mind about
the new forms of leverage is their
permission
they don't require somebody else's
permission for you to use them or
succeed for labor leverage somebody has
to decide to follow you for capital
leverage somebody has to give you money
to invest or to turn into a product but
coding writing books recording podcasts
tweeting youtubing these kinds of things
these are permissionless
you don't need anyone's permission to do
that and that's why they're very
egalitarian they're great equalizers of
leverage and as much as particular may
rail on Facebook and YouTube
they're not gonna stop using it because
this permissionless leverage where
everyone can be a broadcaster it's just
too good the same way you know you can
rail up on Apple for having a slightly
closed ecosystem in the iPhone but
everyone's writing apps for it and so as
long as you can write apps for it you
can get rich or reach users doing that
why not I think of all the forms of
leverage the best one in modern society
and people that have this glib this is a
little overused but and this is why I
tell people learn to code right it's
that we have this idea that in the
future there's gonna be these robots and
they're gonna be doing everything and
that may be true but I would say the
majority the robot revolution has
already happened
the robots are already here and there
are way more robots than they're humans
it's just that we packed them in data
centers for heat and efficiency reasons
we put them in servers they're inside
the computers all the circuits it's a
robot mind inside that's doing all the
work and so every great software
developer for example now has an army of
robots working for him at nighttime
while he or she sleeps after they've
written the code and it's just cranking
away so the robots army is already here
the robot revolution has already
happened we're about halfway through it
we're just adding in much more of the
hardware component these days as we get
more familiar we get more comfortable
with the idea of autonomous vehicles and
autonomous airplanes an autonomous ships
and maybe autonomous trucks and you know
their delivery BOTS and Boston Dynamics
robots and all that but robots who are
doing web searching for you for example
are already here you know the ones who
are like cleaning up your video and
audio and transmitting it around the
world are already here the ones who are
answering many customer service queries
things that you would have had to call
human for already here so an army of
robots is already here it's very cheaply
available and the bottleneck is just
figuring out intelligent and interesting
things to do to them and essentially you
can
this army of robots around just the
commands have to be issued in a computer
language in the language that they
understand so these robots aren't very
smart they have to be told very
precisely what to do and how to do it so
coding is such a great superpower
because now you can speak the language
of the robot armies and you can tell
them what to do and I think at this
point actually people are not only
commanding the army of robots within
servers through code they're actually
manipulating the movement of trucks of
other people just ordering a package on
Amazon you're manipulating the movement
of many people and many robots they get
a package delivered to you people are
doing the same things to build
businesses now so there's the army of
robots within servers and then there's
also an army of people and robots of
actual robots and people that are being
manipulated through software
