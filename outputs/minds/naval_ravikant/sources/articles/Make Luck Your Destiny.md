I think it's pretty interesting that the
first three kinds of luck that you
described there are very common cliches
for them that everybody knows and then
for that last kind of luck that comes to
you out of the unique way that you act
there's no real cliche for it so for the
first three kinds there is dumb luck or
blind luck that's the first kind of luck
the second kind of luck does the cliche
that fortune favors the bold that's a
person who gets lucky just by stirring
the pot and acting the third kind of
luck people say that chance favors the
prepared mind but for the fourth kind of
luck there is not really a common cliche
out there that matches the unique
character of your action which i think
is interesting and perhaps an
opportunity and it also just shows that
people aren't necessarily taking
advantage of that kind of luck the way
they should be I think also at that
point it starts becoming so
deterministic that it stops being luck
so the definition starts fading from
luck to more destiny so I would
characterize that fourth one is you
build your character in a certain way
and then your character becomes your
destiny one of the things I think that
is important to making money when you
want the kind of reputation that makes
people do deals through you you know I
use the example of like if you're a
great diver then treasure hunters will
come and give you a pieces of treasure
for your diving skills if you're a
trusted reliable high integrity
long-term thinking deal maker then when
other people want to do deals but they
don't know how to do them in a
trustworthy manner with strangers they
will literally approach you and give you
a cut of the deal or offer you a unique
deal just because of the integrity and
reputation that you've built up Warren
Buffett he gets offered deals and he
gets to buy companies and he gets to
file warrants and bail out banks and do
things that other people can't do
because of his reputation but of course
that's fragile
it has accountability on the line it has
a strong brand on the line and as we
will talk about later that comes with
accountability attached but I would say
your character your reputation these are
things that you can build that then will
let you take out advantages of
opportunities that other
we'll make characterizes lucky but you
know that it wasn't luck you said that
this fourth kind of luck is more or less
a destiny
there's a quote from that original book
that was in Mark's blog post from
Benjamin Disraeli who I think was the
former prime minister of the UK the
quote to describe this kind of luck was
we make our fortunes and we call them
fate there were a couple other
interesting things about this kind of
luck that were mentioned in the blog
post I think it'll be good for the
listeners to hear about is that this
fourth kind of luck can almost come out
of eccentric ways that you do your
things and that eccentricity is not
necessarily a bad thing in this case in
fact it's a good thing yeah absolutely
because the world is a very efficient
place so everyone has dug through all
the obvious places to dig and so to find
something that's new and novel and
uncovered it helps to be operating on a
frontier where right there you have to
be a little eccentric to be out on the
frontier by yourself and then you just
have to be willing to dig deeper than
other people do deeper than seems
irrational just because you're
interested yeah the two quotes that I've
seen that expressed this kind of luck in
addition to that Benjamin Disraeli one
are this one from Sam Altman where he
said extreme people get extreme results
I think that's pretty nice and then
there's this other one from Jeffrey
Pfeffer who is a professor at Stanford
that you can't be normal and expect
abnormal returns
I've always enjoyed that one too yeah
and one quote that I like which is the
exact opposite of that is play stupid
games win stupid prizes all right a lot
of people spend a lot of their time
playing social games like on Twitter
where you're just trying to improve your
social standing and you basically win
stupid social prizes which are worthless
I guess the last thing that I have from
this blog post is just the idea that by
pursuing these kinds of luck especially
the last one basically everything but
dumb luck by pursuing them you
essentially run out of unlock so if you
just keep stirring the pot and stirring
the pot that alone you will run out of
unlock
yeah or it could just be reversion to
the mean right so then you at least
neutralize luck so that it's your own
talents that come into play
