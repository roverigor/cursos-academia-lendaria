welcome to the eponymous novel podcast
the main topic that we started out on
was timeless principles of wealth
creation and then we've been touching a
little bit on internal happiness and
peace and well-being
but i am first and foremost a student of
science and failed physicist if you will
i loved physics i wanted to pursue it
but i never felt i was going to be great
at it and i was pulled into more
technology which is applied science
nevertheless i've remained a student of
science i remain fascinated by it and
all of my real heroes are scientists
because i believe that
science is the engine that pulls
humanity forward
i've been lucky to live in an age where
scientific progress and technological
progress
seem not likely but inevitable so we've
gotten used to this idea that life
always gets better despite all the
complaining that goes on
about how productivity growth is
stagnant the reality is anyone who owns
a smartphone or drives a car
or even lives in a house has seen
technology improve their quality of life
over and over again we take this
progress for granted
and it's thanks to science so i continue
to
be fascinated by science and to me
science is also the study of truth
what do we know to be true how do we
know something to be true and as i get
older i find myself incapable
of having attention span for anything
which is not steeped in truth
so the background on this particular
podcast series
is i thought i knew a lot about science
and there was a lot about science that i
took for granted such as what scientific
theory is and
how scientific theories are formed most
of us have a vague idea of it
and it can range from some people think
science is what scientists do
which has a definitional problem as in
what is a scientist
and other people think well science is
making falsifiable or testable
predictions and maybe that's closer to
it
and then sometimes people say what's the
scientific method and what is the
scientific method
and then they start describing their
junior high school chemistry experiment
and
lose the trail after that especially in
these days where we're told to
quote unquote believe in science which
is an oxymoron
people respect science but they don't
understand what science is
the idea of what science is is getting
hijacked sometimes by well-meaning
people who want to convince you of the
science and sometimes by not so
well-meaning people who just want to
influence the way that you think and
feel and act
i was very pleasantly surprised a couple
of years back that i reopened an old
book which i had read or i thought i'd
read about a decade ago called the
beginning of infinity
by david deutsch sometimes you read a
book
and it makes a difference right away
sometimes you read a book and you don't
understand it then you read it later at
the right time and it makes a difference
this time when i reopened this book and
i went through it much more carefully
than i had in the past
meticulously rather than reading it to
read it and to say i was done reading it
i read it to understand the concepts and
the topics and stopped at every point
where something was new
it completely started reforming my
worldview it changed the way that i
think
and i would credit this book as being
probably the only book
in the last decade except maybe a few of
nasim teleb's works and
maybe one or two other scatter books
that i feel made me smarter
they literally expanded the way that i
think they expanded not just the
repertoire of my knowledge but the
repertoire of my reasoning
people throw around words like mental
models a lot and i find most
mental models not worth reading or
thinking about or listening to
because i find them trivial however the
mental models that came out of the
beginning of infinity are
transformational
because they very convincingly
completely change the way that you look
at what is true and what is not
karl popper laid out the theory of what
is scientific and what is
not what is a good explanation what is
not and what deutsch does is he
expands on that dramatically in the
beginning of infinity but even that is
to do it a disservice
the wide-ranging nature of what he
covers in the beginning of infinity
is incredible he goes from the theory of
knowledge which goes by the fancy word
epistemology
all the way to quantum mechanics and
physics and multiverse theory
to infinity and mathematics to the reach
of what is noble and what is not noble
universal explanations the theory of
computation what is beauty what systems
of politics works better
how to raise your children these are all
encompassing
long-range philosophical ideas the
beginning of infinity is not an easy
book to
read to some level deutsche could not
but write for other physicists
he has a certain peer group that he
respects and who respect him
and he has to meet them at their level
so he has to write for other physicists
and philosophers
part of what i wanted to do was i wanted
to understand these principles in the
book
verify confirm them for myself or not i
love the old motto from the royal
society which says
nullius and verba which says take no
one's word for it
in other words figure it out yourself
that's the only way you know anything
so i wanted to confirm the principles in
the beginning of infinity or to refute
them for myself
so to do that i was reading and
rereading the book i started reading
some blog posts on it
and then eventually i found a guy online
named brett hall
and i started listening to his podcast
which was called talk cast but tok cast
for the theory of knowledge cast and
brett i'm going to let you introduce
yourself but i would say that listening
to your podcast has helped me
clarify a lot of these principles and i
would love to have you
talk with me so that we can both
understand the depth
the clarity the reach the importance of
these ideas
and then hopefully someone else out
there can become smarter
by it hello naval and it's great to be
here
you've raised so many interesting
aspects of the beginning of infinity
which has become a real passion of mine
like many people who enter into science
when i was at school i thought well i
want to be an astronomer when i enter
university i want to
go and do a physics degree do an
astronomy degree and then become a
professional astronomer
it wasn't until one day i was in a
bookstore and i found
this book called the fabric of reality
by david deutsch
and i started reading it and the first
chapter
described what i was trying to achieve
in my life it was putting into words
what
i felt my university studies what my
general outlook on life was about
because david deutsch says there the
ancient philosophers thought that they
could get an
understanding of the entire world and
then
later on as time passed modern science
made it seem as though
this was an impossible project there's
no way you could understand everything
about reality
there's too much to know how could you
possibly know everything
david deutsch presents at the beginning
of the fabric of reality
this idea that you don't need to know
absolutely every single fact
that needs to be known in order to
understand fundamentally
everything that can be understood he was
presenting this vision there are
certain fundamental theories in science
and outside of science
and his four theories that he had were
quantum theory the theory of computation
the theory of epistemology
and evolution by natural selection that
these together
formed a world view a lens through which
you could
understand anything that could be
understood
i saw a beautiful video with him on
youtube where he was making the same
points where he was saying
you don't have to memorize and know
every fact
you don't have to know where every
particle moved but if you understand the
deep underlying theories
behind everything then you know at a
high level how
everything works and this can all be
understood by a single person
a single brain a single human being it's
accessible to anybody
and that is a jaw-droppingly powerful
idea
we can have explanations that can reach
the entire universe
and it's worth going through the four
that you'd mentioned
quantum theory is one of them theory of
computation
is another one of them the theory of
evolution
is another one of them and then the
theory of knowledge
or epistemology is the fourth that's the
way he presented it in fabric of reality
is it interesting that relativity is not
in there he regards
quantum theory as being deeper than the
theory of relativity
at some point most physicists expect
that we're going to have a unification
of quantum theory and relativity it's
not to say that in that world view
that we're dismissing relativity but his
guess is that quantum theory will be
more foundational than what the theory
of relativity is
there'll be a space time of the
multiverse that's why
relativity doesn't appear amongst them
the beginning of infinity reminds me the
most of godalesherbach as a book in that
it's very wide-ranging
it stitches together ideas from many
different disciplines it's very
difficult to understand and follow
completely
everyone claims to have read it but as
far as i can tell very few people
understand it
i had this experience in college where i
first found go to lescherbach
and i remember that i put on my
bookshelf and i started reading it and
started reading it started reading it
about a year
later i was probably about halfway
through it and then i just ran out of
time and other things going on
and i remember that i would approach my
other friends in college and i would say
either this is a great book you should
read it or i would say have you read it
and they'd all say yeah yeah that's
great
and a week later they'd roll back and
say yeah red go to leicester buck it was
great and i felt like the stupidest
person in college
and it was only years later that i
realized nobody has read it
as you get older you get more confident
in those confessionals where you either
say either i didn't
read it or i read it at a constant pace
and when i encountered something i
didn't understand i kept going
i went back much later and i still
confess to this day i have not read all
of god lescherbach
but at least at this point i went
through and i found the parts that were
most interesting to me
which were the godel parts and skipped
the ones that were not as interesting to
me which were the bach parts
and i did read those and i did try and
understand them the beginning of
infinity is similar
everybody has it on their bookshelf in
my social circle many claim to have read
it
but very few have gotten it i do go back
to this point
that was first eloquently stated on
twitter by a character named illa
certain
where he said i don't want to read all
the books i just want to read the best
100 over and over again
and i would say that i'm currently stuck
in a loop where at least in science i am
only going to read the beginning of
infinity and the fabric of reality
over and over again until i understand
them fully if i had read them 20 years
ago
i would know a lot more because then i
would have chosen the right books and
the right authors to read subsequently
it's going to be a hard book to follow
you should buy a hardcover and
electronics so you have both
and the audio get in every way possible
if you can get through it on the first
sitting and understand all the points at
a deep level then congratulations
but we're hoping to break it down for
you the difference
with the beginning of infinity you're
getting a world view you're not being
given the standard take
from physicists about how to understand
quantum theory you're not being given
the standard take of how to understand
knowledge from philosophers
and you're certainly not being given the
standard take of how to understand
mathematics for mathematicians
deutsche is qualified in all these areas
he's expert in all these areas
so the world view itself what's at the
core of it deutsche's world view is that
reality is comprehensible problems are
soluble
it's a deeply rationally optimistic
worldview
it believes in good explanations good
scientific explanations and progress
progress is inevitable as long as we
have these good explanations
good explanations have tremendous reach
they are acts of creativity
humans are problem solvers and can solve
all problems
all sins and evil are due to a lack of
knowledge
one can be optimistic about constant
progress
that's what the title the beginning of
infinity refers to that we're the
beginning of an infinite series of
progress
it's a very optimistic take it believes
that we are at home in the universe the
universe is ours as a resource to
learn about and exploit that material
wealth is a set of physical
transformations that we can affect
that everything that is not forbidden by
the laws of physics is eventually
possible
through knowledge and knowledge creation
he also
talks about how humans are universal
explainers that anything that can be
known and understood
can be known and understood by human
beings in the computation power of a
human system
it's all noble it's all noble by humans
we're the beginning
of an infinity of knowledge and as we
understand
things using good explanations and we
create new theories that are constantly
being destroyed and replaced by better
ones
there's no end point in sight there's no
perfection every theory can be falsified
and improved that we are on our way to
being able to do
everything that is not forbidden by the
laws of physics
what does the transforming is knowledge
we can take some raw material that had
no particular use
and within that raw material we might
find uranium nuclei which then can be
used in a nuclear reactor to create
energy
or bombs we can find within something
that
for almost the entire geological
existence of the earth
sat there inert and would have done
nothing absent
people people are the entities within
the universe that create
explanations they're able to explain
what raw materials
might be transformed into now what are
they transforming these raw materials
into
civilization people creating knowledge
end up becoming literally a force of
nature if we
seek to explain something like the shape
of a galaxy or the shape of the star
any astrophysicist will give you a story
based upon
the known laws of physics about how
gravity will pull things into spheres
how the laws of thermodynamics will
cause certain kinds of gas to heat up
and expand all of the known laws of
physics
are sufficient to explain what we see
out there in the cosmos
but the laws of physics alone will not
be able to explain the appearance
of manhattan you have to invoke things
other than
merely the fundamental laws of physics
you need to invoke
the existence of people and their
capacity to explain the world
scientifically philosophically
politically
because it's all of those things that
will come together to explain why we
have certain structures like skyscrapers
in manhattan this is a profound idea
it's an idea that
seems to have been overlooked by
scientists many of whom have a
reductionist idea about
how to explain what we see in our
environment
they will seek to explain only the
natural phenomena that are in our
environment
of course everyone wants to know how the
laws of nature work
but if we want to understand how the
universe
from this point onwards whether it's
locally on our own planet
eventually the solar system eventually
the galaxy is going to evolve over time
we're going to have to talk about the
knowledge that people create
and the choices that they're going to
make into the future this is a different
vision
of the place of people in the universe
stephen hawking famously said people are
nothing special
people in chemical scum on a very
typical planet
orbiting an average star in the outer
suburbs a very typical galaxy which is
one
among hundreds of billions of galaxies
in the universe
this vision of what people are and of
what the planet earth is
it's true in a trivial sense but it
misses the point
that in people are a hub of a kind
we are so far as we know the sole place
in the universe which is creating
knowledge an
open-ended stream of knowledge that
could
transform the rest of reality in the
same way that
gravity is able to pull that galaxy into
a particular shape
knowledge in the future will be able to
shape the course of
the planet the solar system eventually
the galaxy
we will have this profound impact upon
everything that we can see around us and
there's nothing that the laws of physics
the laws of chemistry or even the laws
of biology
can predict what is going to happen in
the future the
attempt to predict the future growth of
knowledge
is impossible that's the nature of
knowledge because
knowledge creation is genuinely an act
of creation
it is bringing something into existence
that wasn't there prior
if you could predict it you would have
invented it already a lot of our deeply
pessimistic world views come from
a straight line linear extrapolation of
negative trends
while ignoring positive trends and
positive trends mostly come through
creativity and knowledge creation
and it's inherently unpredictable so
every generation has this doomsayers and
cassandras
the modern malthusians who say on this
trajectory we're all gonna die
they're very popular for the same reason
that zombie movies and vampire movies
are popular
but the reality is that they cannot
predict what we're going to do in the
future that is going to improve our
quality of life
and save us from inevitable ruin the
value is in the knowledge
and the knowledge is inside the observer
and the creator in other words the human
it's not inside the thing itself for
example oil is useless unless you know
how to refine it burn it and use it for
combustion
information is useless unless there's a
brand there to receive it
there could be a signal broadcasting
english into outer space but if there
isn't a creature capable of
understanding
what that language is how it works and
who's conveying it then it's just
modulated electromagnetic frequencies
that don't mean anything so a lot of the
information
and a lot of the value is within a
particular knowledge bearing entity
as science grows its reach we've gotten
to a very reductive science where we
break things down to smaller and smaller
pieces
and then we try and explain things on
the basis of that and there is a counter
trend in science which is
complexity theory where we talk about
emergent properties and higher level
systems where we're starting to now look
at systems
as they operate chaotically and
unpredictably at a micro level but at a
macro level we can make certain
statements about them that do have
explanatory power
so humans are unique in our capability
to understand things
there's a phrase that you're going to
hear both brett and i use over and over
again
and that phrase has good explanations
good explanations
is deutsche's improvement upon the
scientific method
at the same time it's beyond science
it's not just true in science but in all
of life we navigate our way through life
and we do it successfully
by creating good explanations if you
take away nothing else
try and understand what a good
explanation is
a good explanation first and foremost is
testifiable
falsifiable you can run some experiment
in the real world
to see if it's true or not stepping back
from that it's a creative explanation
it looks at something that's going on in
the real world and says this is why it's
happening
it is a creative leap that says this is
the underlying
explanation for how the thing works for
example when i talk to my young kids and
we're out watching the sunset
i keep telling them is the sun setting
is the sun going somewhere is the sun
moving
or is it maybe we're moving and we're
moving in such a way that it looks like
the sun is setting
which is the proper explanation because
looking at it naively
you would think the sun is hurtling
across the sky and there goes the sun
again going around the earth
but that may not be the only explanation
there is a completely creative
explanation
that seems to fly in the face of the
obvious observation of the sun's
movement but could also fit the facts
but it requires some creativity
and that creative explanation is that
the earth is rotating good explanations
don't have to be obvious they're not
derived from just looking at what
happened in the past
but they are testable there are
experiments we can run to figure out
is it the sun that is growing around the
earth or is it the earth turning
brett would you say that a scientific
theory is a subset of a good explanation
yes they're the testable kinds of good
explanations
falsifiable theories are actually a dime
a dozen
this doesn't tell you anything about the
quality of the explanation you're being
given
the example that's used in the fabric of
reality is the grass cure for the common
cold
if someone comes along to you and says
if you eat 1.0
kilograms of grass it will cure your
common cold
they have a testable theory the problem
is that no one should test it
why because they haven't given you an
explanation as to what the mechanism is
that would enable grass to cure the
common cold
and if you do eat the 1.0 kilograms of
grass
and it doesn't cure your cold they can
turn around and say
1.1 kilograms might do it right or you
need a different kind of grass
or you need to always do it on a
different day it's always testable
but you're not getting anywhere you're
not making any progress so i think the
second piece of good explanation is hard
to vary it has to be very
precise and there's a good reason for
the precision the famous example he used
in the beginning of infinity is the
why do we have seasons on the earth and
there was the old greek explanation well
it's driven by persephone the goddess of
spring that's when she can leave
hades and there's this whole theory
involving gods and goddesses
not only was that not easily testable it
was very easy to vary persephone could
have been nike
and hades could have been jupiter or
zeus it's very easy to vary that
explanation
without the predictions changing whereas
if you look at the axis tilt theory of
saying the earth is angled at 23 degrees
relative to the sun and
therefore would expect the sun to rise
here in the winter and over there in the
summer
the facts on that are very hard to vary
it makes risky and narrow predictions
they can predict the exact length of
summer and winter at different
latitudes and you can test that very
precisely so
beyond it being a creative theory that
is testable and falsifiable
it should be hard to vary the pieces of
that theory without essentially
destroying that theory and you certainly
don't want to vary it after the fact
like your grass example oh it was one
kilogram now it's 1.1 now it's 1.2
finally the predictions that it makes
should be very narrow and precise and
they should be risky
for example i believe in relativity was
it eddington who did the experiment and
showed that star light gets bent around
an eclipse
and that was a prediction that einstein
had made in relativity which turned out
to be true
that was a risky prediction that took a
long time to confirm
that's an excellent example of what's
called a crucial test which is sort of
the pinnacle of what science is all
about
if we do a test and it doesn't agree
with a particular theory that we have
that's problematic but that doesn't mean
that it refutes the theory because
if you were to refute the only theory
that you have
where do you jump to you don't have any
alternative if we were to do a
scientific test tomorrow
and it was inconsistent with the theory
of general relativity
then what there is no alternative to
general relativity
in fact when there have been experiments
over the years that seem to have been
inconsistent with general relativity
guess what they've all turned out to be
faulty if you had to choose between
whether or not general relativity has
been refuted by your test
or your test is flawed go with the fact
that your test is being flawed
in the case of eddington's experiment we
had two
viable theories for what gravity was we
had newton's theory of universal
gravitation on the one hand
and we had einstein's general theory of
relativity on the other this experiment
that you described
of how much the light was bent during a
solar eclipse
the correct way of describing what
happened is not that
we showed that general relativity was
correct in some final sense but rather
we refuted newton's theory of
gravitation
newton's theory was ruled out because it
was inconsistent with the test
while general relativity was consistent
with the test this doesn't mean that
general relativity is the final word
in science it means it is the best
theory we have for now and there's a
whole bunch of reasons
that we might think general relativity
ultimately has to turn out false
we never have the final word and that's
a good thing that's a really positive
optimistic thing because it means we can
keep on improving we can keep on making
progress
and we keep on discovering new things
there is no end of science
the long thought about idea that so many
have feared that one day progress will
come to a halt that science will end
in fact we are at the beginning of
infinity and we will always
be at the beginning of infinity
precisely because we can improve
our ideas because we're fallible human
beings so none of our theories are
perfect because
we aren't and our process by which we
create knowledge isn't perfect either
it's error-prone there are two other
scientific thinkers that i like who are
unrelated to david deutsch
but come to very similar conclusions one
is nasim taleb who's popularized the
idea of the black swan
which is that no number of white swans
disproves the existence of a black swan
you can never conclusively say all swans
are white you can never
establish final truth all you can do is
work with the best explanation you have
today
which is still better than ignorance far
better but
at any time a black swan can show up and
disprove your theory and then you have
to go find a better one
the other fellow who i find fascinating
is gregory chaitan
he is a mathematician who is very much
in the curt girdle
vein where he tries to explore the
limits and boundaries of what is
possible in mathematics
one of the points that he makes is that
godel's incompleteness theorem
doesn't say that mathematics is junk
it's not a cause for
despair gordo's incompleteness theorem
says that no formal
system including mathematics it can be
both complete and correct
either there are statements that are
true that cannot be proven true in the
system or there will be a contradiction
somewhere inside the system
so this could be a cause of despair for
mathematicians who view
mathematics as this abstract perfect
fully self-contained thing but chetan
makes the argument that actually
it opens up for creativity in
mathematics it means that even in
mathematics
you are always one step away from
falsifying something and then finding a
better explanation for it
it puts humans and their creativity and
their ability to find good explanations
back at the core of it
at some deep level mathematics is still
an art there's very useful things that
come out of mathematics and you're still
building an edifice of knowledge
but there is no such thing as conclusive
settled truth there is no subtle science
there is no settled mathematics there
are good explanations that will be
replaced over time
with more good explanations that explain
more of the world
this is something that we inherit from
our schooling more than anything else
it's part of our academic culture
and breeds into the wider culture as
well people have this idea
that mathematics is this pristine area
of knowledge
where what has proved to be true is
certainly true
then you have science which doesn't give
you certain truth but you can be
highly confident in what you discover
you can use experiments to confirm
that what you're saying appears to be
correct but you might be wrong
and then of course there's philosophy
which is a mere matter of opinion
this is the hierarchy that some people
inherit from school
mathematics are certain science is
almost certain and the rest of it is
more or less a matter of opinion
this is what deutsch calls the
mathematician's misconception
is that mathematicians have this
intuitive way
of realizing that their proof their
theorem
that they've reached by this method of
proof is absolutely certainly true
in fact it's a confusion between
the subject matter and our knowledge of
the subject matter
if i quickly compare it to physics we
have this domain called particle physics
and the
deepest theory we have in particle
physics is called the standard model
which describes all of the different
fundamental particles that there are
and the interactions between these
fundamental particles the forces that
exist between them
and the gauge bosons which mediate the
force between
particles like electrons protons and
neutrons now
what is matter made of we would say
matter is made of these particles the
particles described by the standard
model of physics
but does that rule out the fact that
these
fundamental particles might themselves
consist of even smaller particles
we have this idea of string theory so
our knowledge of what
the most fundamental particles are and
what in reality the most fundamental
particles are
is different so too in mathematics
deutsche explains that
mathematics is a field where what we're
trying to uncover is necessary truth
the subject matter of mathematics is
necessary truth
in the same way that the subject matter
of particle physics are the fundamental
particles
but because the subject matter of
fundamental particle physics are the
fundamental particles that doesn't mean
you actually find the fundamental
particles
all it means is that you have found the
smallest particles that your biggest
particle accelerators are able to
resolve
but if you had an even bigger particle
accelerator you might find particles
within those particles this has been the
history of particle physics by the way
we used to think that atoms were
fundamental then of course we found that
they contain nuclei
and electrons in the nuclei we found out
there were protons and neutrons
inside the protons and neutrons we found
out they were made up of quarks and
that's where we're at right now
we're at the point where we say that the
quarks are fundamental and the electrons
are fundamental
but that doesn't mean that we're going
to end particle physics right now
what we need are further theories about
what
might be inside of those really small
particles
comparing that to mathematics if
necessary truth is the subject matter of
mathematics
our knowledge of that necessary truth is
what mathematicians
are engaged in they're engaged in
creating knowledge about
necessary truth and because a
mathematician
has a brain which is a physical object
and all physical objects are subject to
making errors of degradation via the
second law of thermodynamics or simply
just
the usual mental mistakes and errors
that any human being makes a
mathematician is just as fallible as
anyone else
then what they end up proving could
be an error so if i understand this
point even mathematics is capable of
error
because mathematics is a creative act
we're never quite done
there could have been a mistake in your
axiom somewhere ultimately even
mathematics is a creative act and can
have error within it all knowledge
is conjectural it's always being
guessed it's our best understanding at
any given time
you're right to say that the axioms
might be incorrect
how do we know that an axiom is
incorrect traditionally the answer has
been because
it's clearly and obviously the case how
can you prove that
x plus 0 must equal x well you just have
to accept that it's true
but if we consider something like
euclid's elements
for example draw two points on a piece
of paper
now through those two points a unique
straight line can be drawn this was
accepted as true
for centuries when anyone listening
might want to try the experiment for
themselves
take a piece of paper take a pen draw
two dots on the piece of paper
now how many unique straight lines can
you draw
through those two dots it should be
fairly obvious to you that only one such
line can be drawn
however we now know that's false
i just want you to reflect as you're
staring at the piece of paper
through which only one straight line is
being drawn you have the
feeling of certainty you are absolutely
sure
that you're not wrong this feeling is
something we should always be skeptical
of
because when people have been absolutely
certain
even in a domain as apparently
full of certainty as mathematics they've
been shown to be wrong so how can we
show it wrong
here's what you do and you might think
that i'm cheating but then again you
have to reflect on did you understand
what i was saying
when i first told you to draw a unique
straight line through these two points
here's what i want you to do
bend the piece of paper think in three
dimensions
wrap the piece of paper around a
basketball if you have one
now consider the ways in which you could
draw a straight line through those two
points
you could punch a hole through one of
those dots with your pen
and push it out through the other side
through the other hole and now you have
a different straight line you have the
straight line
that is drawn with your pen and you have
a straight line that is literally your
pen that has been pushed through these
two dots
so your initial feeling of absolute
certainty that only a unique line
could be drawn through these two dots is
false and you might be thinking
that's unfair that's cheating you were
thinking in two dimensions no you were
thinking in two dimensions i wasn't
i was thinking of more dimensions than
that karl popper has this wonderful
saying it is impossible
to speak in such a way that you cannot
be misunderstood
this is always the case so even in
mathematics where we try and be as
precise as possible
it's possible for people to make errors
to think
false premises about what the argument
is that they're trying to make
and by the way this particular example
of euclidean geometry because geometry
was traditionally always done in two
dimensions on a piece of paper
was resolved by various people and led
to geometry in
curved space which led to einstein
coming up with
general theory of relativity so it is
questioning
these deepest assumptions that we have
where we think
there's no possible way we could be
mistaken that leads to true progress to
genuine fundamental change in the
sciences and everywhere else
you said that we went from atoms in
the time of democritus down to nuclei
and from there to protons and neutrons
and then to quarks
it's particles all the way down to
paraphrase feynman we can keep going
forever but it's not quite forever right
at some point you run it into the planck
length
there's the planck time there's the
plank length there's even the plank mass
which is actually quite a large mass
these things don't have any physical
significance
it's not like the planck time is the
shortest possible time
and it's not like the plank length is
the shortest possible length
the reason for that is because these
planck
things are part of quantum theory but
length is not described by quantum
theory
it's described by the general theory of
relativity and in that theory
space is infinitely divisible there is
no smallest possible
length or time this illuminates an
ancient
tension between the discrete and the
continuous
because quantum theory seems to suggest
that things are discrete
for example there's a smallest possible
particle of gold
the gold atom there's a smallest
possible particle of
electricity the electron there's a
smallest possible particle of
light the photon in quantum theory we
have this idea of discreteness that
there is a smallest possible thing
from which everything else is built but
in general relativity
the idea is the opposite it says things
can continuously vary
and if the mathematics requires that
things be continuously variable so they
can be differentiated and so on
the idea there is that you can keep on
dividing up space and you can keep on
dividing up time
so physicists understand that there is
this contradiction
at the deepest level of our most
foundational
explanations in physics and it's one of
the reasons why
there are these attempts to try and
unify quantum theory and general
relativity because
what is the fundamental nature of
reality is it that
things can be infinitely divisible or is
it that
we must stop somewhere or other because
if it's infinitely divisible then
quantum theory might have to be
subservient to general relativity but we
just don't know
there goes my solution for zeno's
paradox which is before you can get all
the way somewhere you have to get
halfway there and before you can get
halfway there you have to get a quarter
of the way there and therefore you'll
never get there
one way to get past that is say even a
series of infinite
things can have a finite sum just run
the infinite series and sum it
and we learned pretty early on that
converges but another thought i had was
that
you have to cover a minimum distance a
plank length and therefore you will get
there it's a finite series of steps but
you're saying we just don't know
yes so if the laws of physics say that
we can cover one meter in a certain time
period then that's exactly what we'll do
and our current understanding of the
laws of physics say precisely that so
zeno's paradox is resolved simply by
saying that
we can cover this space in this amount
of time it's silent on whether or not
space is
infinitely divisible when someone asks
you is space
infinitely divisible then i would say
yes it is and they might turn around and
say how do you know and i would say
general relativity
how do i know that's true well i don't
know that it's true however
it is the best explanation that we
presently have
of space time and then they might get
into a discussion about well if it's
infinitely divisible then you're
presented with xenos paradox all over
again
and i would say no you refute that by a
simple experiment so we don't know how
it is
that we can travel through all of these
infinite points if in fact there are
infinite points
xeno's paradox is about the domain of
pure mathematics but we don't live in a
world of pure mathematics we live in a
world of
physics and if the physics says that we
can transverse an infinite number of
points in a finite amount of time
then that's what we'll do regardless of
what the mathematics is
every mathematical theory is held inside
a physical substrate of a brain or a
computer
you're always bound by the laws of
physics and these pure abstract domains
may have no mapping to reality the
overwhelming majority of
theorems in mathematics are theorems
that we cannot possibly prove
this is girdle's theorem and it also
comes out of turing's
proof of what is and is not computable
these things that are not computable
vastly outnumber the things that are
computable and
what is computable depends entirely upon
what computers we can make in this
physical universe the computers that we
can make must obey our laws of physics
if the laws of physics were different
then we'd be able to prove
different sorts of mathematics and this
is another part of the
mathematician's misconception they think
they can get outside of the laws of
physics
however their brain is just a physical
computer their brain must obey the laws
of physics
if they existed in a universe with
different laws of physics then they
could prove different theorems
but we exist in the universe that we're
in and so we're bound by a whole bunch
of things not least of which is the
finite speed of light
so there could be certain things out
there in abstract space
which we would be able to come to a more
full understanding of
if we could get outside of the
restrictions of the laws of physics here
happily none of those theorems that we
cannot prove at the moment
are inherently interesting some things
can be inherently boring
namely all of these theorems which we
cannot possibly prove as true or false
those theorems can't have any bearing in
our physical universe they have nothing
to do with our physical universe
and this is why we say they're
inherently uninteresting and there's a
lot of inherently uninteresting things
does probability actually exist in the
physical universe
or is it a function of our ignorance if
i'm rolling a dice i don't know which
way it's going to land
so therefore i put in a probability but
does that mean that there's an actual
probabilistic
unknowable thing in the universe is the
universe flipping a coin somewhere
or is it always deterministic all
probability
is actually subjective uncertainty and
randomness
are subjective if you don't know what
the outcome's going to be so you roll a
dice
that's because you individually do not
know
it's not because there is uncertainty
there deeply in the universe
what we know about quantum theory is
that
all physically possible things occur
this leads to the concept of the
multiverse
and rather than refute all of the failed
ways of trying to understand quantum
theory we're just going to take
seriously
what the equations of quantum theory say
what we are compelled
to think about quantum theory given the
experiments is that
every single possible thing that can
happen does happen
this means that there is no inherent
uncertainty in the universe because
everything that can happen actually will
happen it's not like some things
will happen and won't happen everything
happens now you
occupy a single universe and in that
universe when you roll the dice
it comes up a two but we know somewhere
else in physical reality it comes up a
one
somewhere else three a four a five and a
six if i'm rolling two dice
then the universe in which they sum up
to two
is less than the number of universes in
which we roll a seven because that can
be three or four or five and a two and
so on
so the number of universes still does
correspond
to what we calculate as the probability
yes this leads to what deutsch calls the
decision theoretic way of understanding
probability within quantum theory
decision theoretic means you assume this
proportionality between the universe is
this way of splitting things up
so if you're rolling two different dice
then the
universes proportion themselves into
measures
and what a measure is is it's a way of
talking about infinities
there is a video on youtube which has
deutsche explained the famous quantum
double slit experiment
which is about particle wave duality is
light a particle or a wave
you pass it through a slit depending on
whether there's observer and
interference or not it ends up in a wave
pattern ends up as individual photons
and this is the famous experiment which
has baffled people for a long time and
caused them to revise their world view
the one that led einstein to say god
does not play dice with the universe
correct einstein was a realist at the
time when the founders of quantum theory
were trying to develop a
good explanation of what precisely was
going on
with these experiments in quantum theory
einstein
rejected all of them on the basis that
they weren't realistic and he was right
to do so
because none of them made any sense and
to this day none of the other
alternatives make any sense now einstein
didn't know about
the multiverse we had to wait until hugh
everett in the 1950s
was able to devise a simple realistic
way of understanding
quantum theory but if i go back to this
idea of the double state experiment
it is often claimed that particles have
a duality to them sometimes they're
particles and sometimes they're waves
the electron for example
given certain experiments will behave
like a particle and in other experiments
it behaves like a wave
people who hear this think well okay
that kind of explains what's going on
for example
in the photoelectric effect you shine a
light at
electrons which literally means you're
firing a photon a particle of light
at an electron and you can knock the
electron out of the atom
this is supposed to be proof positive
that light in the form of photons
and electricity in the form of electrons
are both particles
because they're bouncing off one another
and this is what particles do waves
don't do that
you watch water waves at the beach
you'll see they pass through each other
they don't bounce off one another
waves will bounce off particles but they
won't bounce off each other
prior to young's twin slit experiment we
actually relied upon
newton's ideas of light and newton's
idea was that
light was corpuscular as he said which
means made of particles
and then young came along and he shone a
light through
two slits cut into a piece of paper and
what you find when you project
that light onto another sheet of paper
is not just
two beams of light you find what's
called an interference pattern
where the light has interfered with
itself in the same way that when
waves pass through small apertures
natural geological gaps
they will interfere with one another
they produce crests in some places and
troughs in others
they can cancel each other out this was
supposed to be proof
to some of the early physicists that
light in fact was a wave
and now we get to quantum theory and we
find that things
we thought were certainly particles like
electrons when we do the same experiment
with them
they interfere with one another so it
appears as though we've got
particles acting like waves and waves
acting like particles
the resolution to this is not to admit
nonsense so this is what often is
explained in quantum theory lectures
in undergraduate level is that you have
to accept that something like a photon
is born as a particle it lives
as a wave and then it dies again as a
particle which
is nonsense and the reason it's nonsense
is because the photon doesn't know that
it's alive and it's dead it doesn't know
what experiment it's participating in so
we have to come to a deeper
understanding of how to explain
what is going on in this double-slit
experiment because
if we fire either a photon or an
electron at that double slit apparatus
and we put
a detector at either of those slits then
we will detect a particle
so we can detect that we fired a
particle we can detect that a particle
is going
through those slits and we can detect a
particle at
the projection screen as well when you
do this experiment in the laboratory
using electrons you can see the dots
where the electrons strike
hitting the screen but you don't get a
simple pattern that you would expect if
you're firing cannon balls
at a wall where there are two holes in
the wall through which the cannonballs
can go
you would expect that all the
cannonballs are going to go through
those two holes and land in
one of two positions behind the wall but
with particles
at the quantum level that's not what
happens
something is going on and the only
explanation
is that when we fire a photon there's
the photon that we can see
in our universe but there's also photons
in other universes
passing through the apparatus that we
cannot see and these
photons are able to interact with the
photon
that we are able to detect this is where
the concept of interference comes in
interference is an old concept in
physics it goes back to waves waves
certainly interfere
but we need to understand the way in
which particles can interfere one with
another
particles that we can observe and
particles that we can only assume to
observe
given these experiments and this is why
we are forced
into acknowledging the existence of
these other particles
and not only these other particles but
other universes in which these particles
exist
now people might object at this point
and go how dare you invoke in science
things that cannot be seen things that
cannot be observed this is completely
antagonistic towards the scientific
method surely
and i'll say to anyone who's thinking
that right now almost everything of
interest
that you know about science is about the
unobserved
let's consider dinosaurs dinosaurs are
unobserved
you say oh hold on i've been to the
museum i've seen a dinosaur now you have
seen a fossil
and a fossil isn't even a bone it's an
ossified bone it has been metamorphised
into rock
so no one has ever seen a dinosaur we
have seen things that look like
dinosaurs and interpreted them
to be huge reptilian bird-like creatures
that when we assemble their skeletons we
make up a story
about what this thing was that walked
the earth
tens or hundreds of millions of years
ago in the same way
no one has ever seen the core of the sun
and no one will ever observe
the core of the sun but we know about
stellar fusion we know
that hydrogen nuclei are being crushed
together there to form helium in the
process producing heat
we don't see the big bang we don't see
the movement of continents almost
everything of interest in science
we do not observe even many of the
things that we say we have seen we've
actually just seen instruments detect
those things so we're watching the
effects
through instruments and then theorizing
that there are other universes out there
where the photons are interacting with
the photons that we can see
there are many scientists philosophers
have talked about this concept of a
multiverse but this
is a very strict very sober
understanding of what a multiverse is
all of these universes in this
multiverse
obey the same laws of physics we're not
talking about universes where there are
other laws of physics this should be no
more surprising than historically
when it used to be thought to be the
universe consisted of our planet
and around our planet orbited everything
else other planets
stars the sun the moon orbited around us
existed on this tiny planet
then our vision of reality got expanded
a little bit
we realized in fact we were not at the
center of the universe
the sun was at the center and these
other planets were in fact
bigger in some cases in the case of
jupiter and saturn and the gas giants
bigger than what our planet of earth is
the sun was a lot bigger than what we
are
so our universe became larger then we
realized that we were just
one star system among many in a huge
galaxy of hundreds of billions of stars
then later we realized that this galaxy
is one of hundreds of billions of
galaxies so the history
of ideas and the history of science is a
history of
us broadening our vision of exactly how
large
physical reality is and this is another
step in that general trend
and we should expect it to continue it
shouldn't be that
hard for people to accept that this is
the way to understand things
do we know everything about quantum
theory and how this multiverse works
no we haven't united this multiverse
with general relativity we need a space
time or a geometry of the multiverse
which we don't have yet
so getting back to good explanations
where do these explanations come from
there's currently an obsession with
induction induction being the idea
that you can predict the future from the
past you can say
i saw one then two then three then four
then five so therefore next must be six
seven eight nine
there's a belief that this is how new
knowledge is created this is how
scientific theories are formed
and this is how we can make good
explanations about the universe
what's wrong with induction and where
does new knowledge
come from you did mention the black swan
earlier and i'd like to go back to that
the black swan
is an example that various people have
used over the years
in order to illustrate this idea that
repeatedly observing the same phenomena
over and again
should not make you confident that it
will continue in the future
in europe we have white swan so any
biologist
who's interested in birds be observing
white swan after white swan
and apparently concluding on that basis
that therefore all swans are white
then someone travels to western
australia and there you notice that
there are swans that otherwise look
identical to the ones in europe
but they're black let's consider another
example of induction
ever since the beginning of your life
you have observed
that the sun has risen does this mean
that scientifically you should conclude
the sun will rise tomorrow
and rise every day after that this is
not what science is about
science is not about cataloging a
history of events that have occurred in
the past
and presuming they're going to occur
again in the future science is an
explanatory
framework it's an error correcting
mechanism it's not
ever of the form the sun always rose in
the past therefore arise in the future
there's all sorts of ways in which we
can imagine the sun won't rise tomorrow
all you need to do is to take a trip to
antarctica and there for some months of
the year the sun doesn't rise at all
if you go to the international space
station you won't see the sun rise once
per day and set once per day
it will rise and set repeatedly over the
course of your very fast journey around
the earth
there's another example from science
like this on a heat source
put a beaker of water then put a
thermometer into that water and turn on
your heat source
then record as the time passes what the
temperature of the water
is you will notice that the temperature
of the water will increase you can do
this with a saucepan at home
so long as the heat source is relatively
constant the temperature
rise will be relatively constant as well
so after one minute
the temperature might go from 20 degrees
celsius to 30 degrees celsius
imagine every minute it climbs by
another 10 degrees celsius but at some
point it's going to stall when it hits
the boiling point
precisely now if you're a thoroughgoing
inductivist
or even a bayesian reasoner and you
don't know anything about the boiling
temperature and what phenomena happens
at that temperature
you can join all of those lovely lines
into a perfectly diagonal straight line
and extrapolate off into infinity after
two hours
according to your bayesian reasoning
according to your induction
we should assume that the temperature of
that water will be a thousand degrees
celsius
but of course this is completely false
what actually happens is once it starts
boiling
it stays at its boiling temperature we
get a plateau
and this plateau of temperature about
100 degrees celsius
remains there until all the water boils
away now there's no possible way of
knowing this
without first doing the experiment or
having
already guessed via some explanatory
means what was going to happen no method
of recording all of these data points
and extrapolating off into the future
could ever have given you the correct
answer the correct answer can only come
from
creativity and notice that science is
not about
predicting where the trend starts and
where the trend goes
in fact if we want to explain what's
going on with the water
we refer to the particles and how as the
temperature increases the kinetic energy
of the particles
starts to increase which means the
velocity of the particle starts to
increase
eventually those particles in the liquid
state achieve escape velocity
from the rest of the liquid at this
point we have boiling but that escape
velocity the technical term is latent
heat
requires energy and for this reason we
can have heating
of something like water without any
temperature increase
that's what science is that whole
complicated story about how the
particles are moving faster
this invocation of the term latent heat
it's not about trends and predictions
it's about
explanation only once we have the
explanation can we in fact make the
prediction
going even further it's not just science
when we look at innovation
and technology and building for example
everything that thomas edison did and
nikola tesla did
these were from trial and error which is
creative guesses and trying things out
if you look at how evolution works
through variation and then natural
selection
where it tries a lot of random mutations
and it filters out the ones that didn't
work
so this seems to be a general model
through which all complex systems
improve themselves over time
they make bold guesses and then they
weed out the things that didn't work
things like a beautiful symmetry to it
across all knowledge creation
it's ultimately an act of creativity we
don't know where it comes from and it's
not just a mechanical extrapolation of
observations
the most famous example on this we
mentioned black swans we talked about
boiling water
but the fun and easy one is the turkey
you could have a turkey that's being fed
very well every single day and fattened
up and it thinks that it belongs and
lives in a benevolent household
where the farmer comes and feeds it
every day until thanksgiving arrives and
then it's in for a very rude
awakening or i should say an ending that
shows you the limits of induction
precisely the theories have to be
guessed and
all of our great scientists have always
made noises similar to this it's only
the philosophers or certain
mathematicians who think that this is
the way that science happens that it's
this inductive
trend seeking way of extrapolating from
past observations into the future
einstein said that he wasn't necessarily
brighter than most other people it's
that he was
passionately interested in particular
problems and he had a
curiosity and an imagination imagination
was key for him
he needed to imagine what could possibly
explain
these things he wasn't looking at past
phenomena in order to come up with
general relativity
he was seeking to explain certain
problems that existed
in physics induction wasn't a part of it
good explanations
rely on creativity these good
explanations testable and falsifiable of
course but they are hard to vary
and they make risky and narrow
predictions that's a good guiding point
for anybody who is listening to this
podcast and trying to figure out
how they can incorporate this in their
everyday life your best theories are
going to be
creative guesses not simple
extrapolations
i had a bunch of asides that i wanted to
dive into like finding path
integrals because it seems to me that
there's some kind of a deep symmetry
between multiverse theory and finding
path integrals
you're absolutely right he believed in
multiple histories but to the extent
that he thought that these were
actually physically real things or
merely
mathematical objects is open to question
he was relatively silent on the matter
he was certainly a realist but he made
one of the worst quips and's an absolute
genius probably
next to einstein second greatest
physicists of the 20th century
but he said if you think you understand
quantum theory you don't understand
quantum theory
which is nonsense whoever it understood
quantum theory david deutsch understands
quantum theory so
that was one of the few occasions where
feynman fell into irrationality and
pessimism
i think was a plank who said science
advances one funeral at a time
yeah unfortunately even the best gets
stuck behind i see this in my own field
where
you have some of the greatest investors
of our time like warren buffett and
charlie munger who are just absolute
geniuses
but they cannot wrap their minds around
cryptocurrencies the idea that there's
going to be an extra sovereign money
that is native to the internet is
programmable as foreign to them because
to them money is always something that
has been provided by the government and
controlled by the government
and they just cannot imagine it any
other way so it's just the nature of
people
there's also the theory of solomon of
induction i'm going to mangle the
description but it says
if you want to find a theory that
explains why something is happening
and now a theory here is something
that's encoded as a binary string
then the correct theory is actually
going to be
a probability weighted theory that takes
into account
all the possible theories but weighs
them based on their complexity
so the simpler ones are more likely to
be true and the more complex ones are
less likely to be true
and you sum them all together and that's
how you figure out the correct
probability distribution function for
your explanation
that's similar to bayesianism isn't it
in both cases they're assuming
that you can enumerate all the possible
theories but you can't because that's
the creativity coming in
it's very rare in science to have more
than one viable theory in physics we
mentioned
newtonian theory of gravity and there
was general relativity that's one of the
rare occasions where you actually have
these two competing theories
it's almost unknown to have three
competing theories what confuses people
is that
induction and bayesianism work really
well for
finite constrained spaces that are
already known
they're not good for new explanations
bayesianism
is i got new information i used to wait
the previous probability predictions
that i had
now i've changed my probability based on
the new data
so i believe that something different is
going to happen for example
i don't know if you remember the monty
hall show monty hall calls you up and
there's three doors and there's treasure
behind one of them and then two of them
don't have anything
and you pick which door it's going to be
door number one two or three
then he opens one of the other two doors
and shows you there's nothing behind it
now do you want to change your vote the
understanding of knife probability says
no i wouldn't change my vote why should
it matter
that one of the ones he showed me
doesn't have something the probability
should not have changed but
bayesianism says you've got new
information you should revise your guess
and you should switch the other door
and the easier way to say that is
imagine there were 100 doors
and then you picked one at random then
he opens 98 of the remaining 99 shows
you there's nothing now do you switch
and
of course you'd want to switch because
what are the odds that you picked one of
the 100 in the first place
now your odds are 99 out of 100. and
people discover this
and say of course now i'm a smart
bayesian i can update
my priors based on new information
that's what smart people do and
therefore i'm a bayesian
but it in no way helps you discover new
knowledge or new explanations
that's the uncontroversial use of
bayesianism which is a very powerful
tool it's used in
medicine of trying to figure out which
of these medicines might be
more effective than others so there are
whole areas of mathematics like
bayesianism which can be applied in
science without
controversy at all it's where we say
that bayesianism is the way in which we
can generate
new explanations or the way in which we
can judge one explanation against
another
in fact the way in which we generate new
explanations is creativity in the way in
which we judge one explanation against
another is either
experimental refutation or
straightforward criticism of realizing
that one of those explanations
is just a bad explanation induction also
says that prediction is the main
reason for the existence of science but
it's not it's explanation you want an
explanation of what's going on
even if you can't necessarily predict
with any certainty what's going to
happen next
in fact knowing what's going to happen
next with some degree of certainty can
be deflating
and the unknown can be far more fun than
having absolute certitude about what
tomorrow will bring
this brings us to the related point the
science has never settled we should
always be free to have new creativity a
new conjecture
you never know where the best ideas are
going to come from and you have to take
everything that's made in good faith
seriously and so this
idea that the science is settled or the
science is closed is nonsense
and it implies that we can all agree
upon the process with which we come up
with new theories
rather through creativity and conjecture
and the door is always open for new
people with new ideas to come in and do
that
as popper said we're all equal in our
infinite ignorance so even if someone
claims expertise
they might even be valid in their claim
to expertise there's an infinite number
of things they do not know and those
infinite number of things they do not
know could affect the things they
do know so the child who is coming
through school who
is not expert in anything can still come
up with an idea
that can challenge the foundations of
the greatest expert because the expert
like the child is ignorant about a whole
bunch of things
they could have error that does not
preclude someone else
who lacks that fine-tuned knowledge from
being able to point out
there's an error and here's a better
idea a lot of the theories as to why
we're imminently going to create an agi
are based on a naive extrapolation
of computational power it's almost we'll
do the induction of more and more
computational power
and ai has already gotten good at vision
and beating us at chess
and at video games so therefore it's
going to start thinking soon another
offshoot that i want to discuss is this
idea that
humans are this resource consumers on
the earth and we're eating up all the
earth's resources
so having more humans on the earth is a
bad idea whereas if you believe
that knowledge comes from creativity
then any child born tomorrow could be
the next einstein
or the next findman and discover
something that will change the world
forever
with creativity that has non-linear
outputs and effects
but at the moment we're very concerned
about the pollution or the loss of
certain species and these are legitimate
concerns for some people but it should
never be
at the expense of the long-term vision
that perhaps we can solve all of those
problems and far more if only we could
have progress at a faster rate
by using the resources that we have
available to us
there's in question why the world always
seems to be full of more pessimistic
than optimists especially when we still
live
with mostly enlightenment your values
and such tremendous innovation
there are probably multiple reasons for
that but it's just easier to be a
pessimist than an optimist
it's harder to guess how life is going
to improve it's easier to
linearly extrapolate how it's going to
get worse you could also argue that the
risk of ruin is so large that you can't
come back from it
that maybe we're hardwired to be
pessimists because if you're correct
when you're optimistic then you have a
small gain
but if you're wrong when you're
optimistic and you get eaten by a tiger
it goes to zero so maybe we're hardwired
to be pessimistic in that sense
if you're an academic of some kind then
being able to explain
all of the problems that are out there
and how dangerous these problems are and
why you need
funding in order to look at these
problems in more depth
that appears to be the intellectually
serious position someone who claims that
we can solve this it sounds a little bit
kumbaya even though it's quite right
that in fact collaboration cooperation
and resource exploitation will actually
be the thing that's going to drive this
the knowledge economy forward so that we
can solve with these problems it always
seems more intellectually serious if you
can stand up there with a frown on your
face in front of a ted talk audience and
say these are all the ways in which
we're going to fail and which we're
going to come to ruin
i'm guilty of having recorded one of
these doomsayer podcasts about enders
blowing up the earth
that was the one podcast that i
regretted the most we had a great
conversation but
i don't fundamentally agree with any of
the conclusions that might come out of
that which say the world is going to end
so we should slow down the only way out
is through progress
and subsequently i haven't promoted as
much as i promoted my other podcast and
upon reading deutsche i realized why
it's because it's easy to be a pessimist
it's an easy trap to fall into
but it implies that humans are not
creative it doesn't acknowledge
all the ways that we have innovated our
way out of previous traps and
fundamentally
entrepreneurs are inherently optimistic
because they get rewarded for being
optimistic
as you're saying intellectuals get
rewarded for being pessimistic
so there is always a lot of incentive
bias here
as an academic you may be incented to be
pessimistic as an entrepreneur you may
be incented to be optimistic
if you're a pessimist you get your
feedback from other people
it's a social act you're convincing
other people of your pessimism
and so far most of their pessimistic
predictions have turned out to be false
if you look at any timelines on which
the world was supposed to end
or environmental catastrophes were
supposed to happen they've been quite
wrong
but if you look at the optimistic
entrepreneurs
they are rated by feedback from nature
and free markets which i believe
are much more realistic feedback
mechanisms
in general professions in which you get
your feedback from
other members of that profession tend to
get corrupted when you see a journalist
writing articles to impress other
journalists
or a restauranteur running a restaurant
that's designed to
impress other foodies and other
restaurateurs those end up not being
practical and high quality
they may receive accolades and prizes
within certain elite circles
but they're not reflecting reality where
someone who is getting feedback from
either mother nature like a scientist or
an experimentalist
or from free markets where other people
are voting with their money and their
time
those are going to be much better
predictors the people who are operating
in the real world
and are getting paid for it tend to be
optimist the people who are operating
ivory towers
are incented to be pessimists to be an
entrepreneur you need to be optimistic
about the fact that
you're creating something that other
people are going to find value in
and people who have a pessimistic
philosophy tend to have a pessimistic
psychology as well
if you're constantly thinking about all
the ways in which the world is going to
rack and ruin
then this has a day-to-day impact upon
your
outlook on the rest of society and on
your family on your friends
on everything because you think that
this world is condemned
so you're going to feel that weight upon
your shoulders
and it's going to come through in the
way in which you present yourself to the
rest of the world
we see a lot of this on social media
right now entrepreneurs are typically
too busy to spend a whole lot of time on
social media but you do get
scientists academic journalists who are
depressed with life because they have a
pessimistic view of reality and that's
got to have an impact
upon their subjective experience of the
world unlike people who are creating
trying to bring something new into
existence unfortunately the pessimism is
self-fulfilling
all evils are due to lack of knowledge
rational optimism
is the way out the data supports it
history supports it
and we can always come up with good
explanations through creativity
to improve our lives and everybody
else's lives so stay optimistic
