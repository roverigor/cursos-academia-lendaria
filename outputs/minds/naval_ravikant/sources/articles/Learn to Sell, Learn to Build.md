talking about combining skills you said
that you should learn to sell learn to
build if you can do both you will be
unstoppable you know this is a very
broad category now but it's two broad
categories one is building the product
which is hard and it's a multivariate
that can include design that can include
development that can include
manufacturing logistics procurement
it could even be designing and operating
a service it has many many definitions
but in every industry there is a
definition of the Builder in our tech
industry that's the CTOs the programmer
is the software engineer a hardware
engineer but you know even in like a
laundry business it could be the person
who's building the laundry service who
is making the trains run on time who's
making sure all the clothes end up in
the right place the right time and so on
then the other side of it is the sales
side again selling has a very broad
definition selling doesn't necessary
just mean selling individual customers
but it could mean marketing it could
mean communicating it could mean
recruiting it could mean raising money
it could mean inspiring people it could
be doing PR so it's a broad umbrella
category so generally the Silicon Valley
startup model tends to work fast it's
not the only way but it is probably the
most common way when you have two
founders one of whom is a world-class at
sales and one of whom is world-class at
building an example this course Steve
Jobs and Steve Wozniak with Apple Gates
and Alan probably had similar
responsibilities early on with Microsoft
Larry and Sergey you know probably broke
down along those lines although it's a
little different there because that was
a very technical product delivered to
end-users through a simple interface but
generally you will see this pattern
repeated over and over there's a builder
and there's a seller there's a CEO and
CTO combo and adventure and Technology
investors are almost trained to look for
this combo whenever possible it's sort
of the magic combination the ultimate is
when one individual can do both that's
when you get true superpowers that's
when you get people who can create the
entire industries the living example is
Elon Musk he may not necessarily
building the Rockets himself but he
understands enough that he actually
makes technical contributions he
understands the technology well enough
that no one's gonna snow
I'm on it and he's not running around
making claims that he doesn't think he
can eventually deliver he may be
optimistic at the timelines but he
thinks it's within reasonableness of
delivery even Steve Jobs develop enough
product skills and was involved enough
from the product that he also operated
in both of these domains Larry Ellison
started as a programmer and I think
wrote the first version of Oracle arosa
actually heavily involved in it Marc
Andreessen was also in this domain he
may not have had enough confidence in
the sales skills but he was the
programmer who wrote Netscape Navigator
a big chunk of it so I think the real
Giants in any field are the people who
can both build and sell and usually the
building is the thing that like a
salesperson can't pick up building later
in life it requires too much focused
time but a builder can pickup selling a
little bit later especially if they were
already sort of in Italy wired to be a
good communicator
Bill Gates famously paraphrase this as I
would rather teach an engineer marketing
than the market or engineering I think
if you start out with a building
mentality and you have building skills
and still early enough in your life or
you have enough focused time that you
think you can learn selling and you have
some natural characteristics for your
good sales person then you can double
down on those now your sales skills
could be in a different than traditional
domain so for example let's say you're a
really good engineer and then people are
saying well now you need to be good at
sales well you may not be good at
hand-to-hand sales but you may be a
really good writer and writing is a
skill that can be learned much more
easily than say in personal selling and
so you may just cultivate writing skills
until you become a good online
communicator and then use that for your
sales on the other hand it could just be
that you're a good builder and you're
bad at writing and you don't like
communicate to mass audiences but you're
good one-on-one so then you might use
your sales skills for recruiting or for
fundraising which are more one-on-one
kinds of endeavors this is sort of
pointing out that if you're at the
intersection of these two don't despair
because you're not going to be the best
technologist and you're not going to be
the best salesperson but in a weird way
that combination back the scott adams
skill stack that combination of two is
unstoppable long term people who
understand the underlying product and
how to build it
can sell it these are catnip to
investors these people can break down
walls if they have enough energy and
they can get almost anything done if you
could only pick one to be good at which
one would you pick when you're trying to
stand out from the noise building is
actually better because there's so many
hustlers and salespeople who have
nothing to back them up when you're
starting out when you're trying to be
recognized building is better but much
later down the line building gets
exhausting because it is a focused job
and it's hard to stay current because
there's always new people new products
coming up who have newer tools and
frankly more time because it's very
intense is very focused task so sales
skills actually scale better over time
like for example if you have a
reputation for building a great product
that's good but when you ship your new
product I'm gonna evaluate a base in the
product but if you have a reputation for
being a good person to do business with
and you're persuasive and communicative
then that reputation almost become
self-fulfilling so I think if you only
had to pick one you kind of start with
building and then transition to selling
this is a cop-out answer but I think
that is actually the right answer
