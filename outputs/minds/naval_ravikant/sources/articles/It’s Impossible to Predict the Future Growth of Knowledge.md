stephen hawking famously said people are
nothing special
people are chemical scum on a very
typical planet
orbiting an average star in the outer
suburbs a very typical galaxy which is
one among
hundreds of billions of galaxies in the
universe this vision
of what people are and of what the
planet earth is
it's true in a trivial sense but it
misses the point
that people are a hub of a kind we are
so far as we know the sole place in the
universe which is
creating knowledge an open-ended stream
of knowledge that
could transform the rest of reality
in the same way that gravity is able to
pull that galaxy
into a particular shape knowledge in the
future
we'll be able to shape the course of the
planet
the solar system eventually the galaxy
we will have this profound
impact upon everything that we can see
around us
and there's nothing that the laws of
physics the laws of chemistry
or even the laws of biology can predict
what is going to happen in the future
the attempt to predict
the future growth of knowledge is
impossible that's the nature of
knowledge because
knowledge creation is genuinely an act
of creation
it is bringing something into existence
that wasn't there prior
if you could predict it you would have
invented it already a lot of our deeply
pessimistic worldviews come from
a straight-line linear extrapolation of
negative trends
while ignoring positive trends and
positive trends mostly come through
creativity and knowledge creation
and it's inherently unpredictable so
every generation has this doomsayers and
cassandras the modern malthusians
who say on this trajectory we're all
going to die they're very popular for
the same reason that zombie movies and
vampire movies are popular
but the reality is that they cannot
predict what we're going to do in the
future that is going to improve our
quality of life
and save us from inevitable ruin thank
you to aidsleep for supporting the naval
podcast
