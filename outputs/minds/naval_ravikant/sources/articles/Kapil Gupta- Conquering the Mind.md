what's interesting about talking to you
couple is that
you're not for everybody in fact it's
quite the opposite
the things you think about and the way
you speak
really only applies to a very small set
of people this discussion is going to be
unique in
multiple ways and one of those is that
it's just not going to make sense for
most people
it doesn't mean that you should try and
have it make sense to you it's not
something to aspire to it's not some
graduate level course
it just doesn't have interest for most
people but again it's not advanced it's
just different
another way in which this differs is
that i'm nervous to have this
conversation
and normally i'm not that nervous about
podcasts or conversations in fact i'm
very confident about them
in this case i'm a little nervous
because all the questions that i want to
ask you and all the things that i want
to discuss with you are intensely
personal
if i'm not genuinely interested in the
answer
then i'm not really asking the proper
question i'm just
showing off for the audience i've been
working with you couple for years now
i forget how long actually it's been
quite a while and i'm not proud of that
it's actually a failure right because
whatever i need to figure out i should
have figured out by now why do we still
have to keep going over the same old
ground
but the territory that you're walking or
the things that you're interested in and
your take on them is so unique
that it takes time to even just
understand the vocabulary
and the grammar of how you speak and how
you think and how you behave and how you
view the world
there are a couple of key words we can
start with i'm going to start
with the hardest one it's hard because
it's the most unique
it's a word that you use over and over
and i don't think other people really
understand what you're saying even i
still barely understand what you're
saying i have some concept of it
but it's a mental shift that is so
important that i think it's really
important to understand and to examine
carefully
what you mean before we get into the
rest and that word is prescriptions
let's talk about prescriptions
prescriptions are how-to's
they are hacks and they are
techniques and methods various
methodologies
to get somewhere when you talk about
something from the standpoint of a
mechanical behavior
turning on a computer riding a bicycle
prescriptions are useful the problem is
that whenever you
venture into the realm of art in any
form be it in business or sports
or even in the setting of
finding peace in your life or freedom or
arriving
at enlightenment or all of these
so-called spiritual pursuits
those things cannot be prescriptionized
if you attempt to prescriptionize them
what happens is the prescription becomes
the new god
you begin to try to live up to the
prescription
in the beginning you had a place to go i
want to go to
x then you introduce an intermediary the
prescription this is how you get to x
then what will happen is that your mind
will begin to focus upon
the intermediary and it will enter into
a deal
which it never signed up for that deal
is that for the rest of your life you
will attempt to satisfy the intermediary
in all domains you have many people who
do great
things the buddha attained enlightenment
you have
michael jordan and tiger woods doing
amazing things in golf and
elon musk and various individuals who do
great things in business and even
yourself
if you take what those people did and
you write a book and said that these
people did
x if you follow that
you will not become them you will not
i've found business biographies to be
useless for building a great business
they're good for inspiration
i can read steve jobs bio and be
inspired but i can't be steve jobs
and if i want to be amazing at something
then i have to find my own way there
for mechanical things how to's work but
when you're trying to operate at the top
of a field or when you're trying to do
something creative
how to's don't work beyond the most
extreme basics
when you're first starting something it
is actually a mechanical endeavor
you're just figuring out how to drive a
car but when you're trying to figure out
how to race around a track faster than
anyone else
then all coaches and techniques and
prescriptions have to fall by the
wayside
and you are at the edge of the art
that's correct
now the problem is conditioning when
there's only been one loudspeaker
in a person's ear for his entire life
then that is his norm
and that is the only language that he
knows that paradigm of how to
is so embedded inside the culture it is
so deeply embedded inside the cortex of
the human brain
that the idea of omitting it
or the idea of even challenging its
existence
is completely off the wall
it is so otherworldly and antithetical
that it takes years to even get to the
point where
the idea of prescriptions being a
impediment to whatever you seek
begins to dawn people consider you to be
a spiritual guy on twitter and in my
understanding
you're not like that at all spirituality
is a pointless word
it's about utility is something useful
does it get you where you want to go
you're always talking about extreme
performance
and that's why your brand is say the
performance it's a seeking performance
essentially
and seeking the truth that gets you to
the highest performance in all things
whether it's business or sports or peace
of mind
this drive towards utility reality
truth performance they somehow wander
into spirituality
people interpret them in spiritual ways
but it feels like spirituality is so
cluttered with nonsense
that it gets lost your model makes sense
if one realizes that it's designed to go
after extreme performance if you want to
be the best in the world at anything
you cannot follow prescription if you
want to be okay at it then sure you can
follow a prescription
if you want to learn how to lose a pound
a month and get in decent shape then you
can follow a calorie counting worksheet
but if you want to be a shredded
bodybuilder or an olympic athlete
you're not going to get there through
how-to's you're going to have to create
and forge your own path that is unique
to you
would that be a good way of putting it
well what i will add to that is
that one does not have to want to become
the greatest in the world if you look at
the lives of human beings there is
intense struggle
the guy who works three jobs doesn't
want to work three jobs
he may not want to become tiger woods
but
he wants to be beyond being forced to
work three jobs
what keeps him working three jobs is
prescriptions
the futility of prescriptions does not
just
harm one who wants to become world class
it gravely harms the one who simply
doesn't want to struggle
the way i think about it in the business
world is that hard work has very little
to do
with effectiveness the grocery store
owner
or the person working at a restaurant
might work 60 80 hours a week
and that might be all elon musk is
working but elon's making a lot more
money
because of his specific knowledge
knowledge that cannot be taught
but can be learned on the job if you
have a strong enough desire
because elon is doing the right things
he is far more effective in earning
power
and the right things at least in
business can't be taught because it's a
moving target
it can only give very vague principles
that inspire people
to head in the right direction but i
can't teach you how to make money
or trade the stock market it's like when
people ask you for stock tips
no one who's any good at stock trading
gives actionable investment advice in a
public forum
because all the details are too hard to
convey i can always tell people who ask
for stock tips
they're not really serious about
investing people who ask for book
recommendations aren't really serious
about reading
people who ask what business should i
build aren't really serious about
entrepreneurship people who say what
career
path should i take they're not really
serious about their career
when someone's asking for a how-to and
anything they aren't actually
that serious about it if they were truly
serious about it
they would figure it out but then that
leaves the
paradoxical question well how do i
figure it out
take the person who quote made it and
became world class in whatever he did
if he went back and retraced his steps
and did everything again
the same way but this time he did it by
mimicking himself
he would fail even he wouldn't be able
to do it
what has to be understood is that where
greatness comes from
it's a very murky affair it is
non-linear
it is unpredictable perhaps nature and
the universe set it up this way
that you have to jump in and once you
jump in the soup
and you're being bombarded through all
sides and you live in confusion
and you have no idea which way is up
if the obsession is there then what
happens is through
some messy process
you find a way you see light at the end
of the tunnel
you forge a path through the jungle that
was not done according to a how you were
flailing the entire time
so there was no how to flail when you
come out through the tunnel
and someone asks you how you did it you
have no idea
the thing that's almost laughable is
when you ask a great athlete
can you show me how you did that they
won't come on and say i have no idea
they will provide you with some
semblance of an answer which is a
non-answer
and what they will do is because there's
a gun point to their head and their
backs against a wall
they will create the highlights when the
human being who watches that
follows the highlights he misses and the
reason that he misses is because it's
all the small things i can't watch roger
federer play tennis and swing the rocket
the same way
nor will any description from him on how
to swing the rocket get me to swing it
the right way
then we go to intellectual efforts we
start asking warren buffett why he
invests in a company
and there he can try and create a mental
construct as to how he thinks and how he
invests in the company
but there are just as many details to
warren buffett's activities
when he decides what to invest in and
how he lives his life and how he thinks
as there are to roger federer's body
running around a tennis court hitting a
ball
the details are not transmissible
they're not copyable
you can be inspired to try it yourself
but without that sincerity that
obsession
you won't get there not only are the
details not transmissible
the details are not even knowable ah so
warren and roger don't even know it
themselves
absolutely not no great artist knows the
things that you do
greatest are the things that you know
not how you do them
i would argue that you're not even there
when you do them you're not consciously
thinking about it
i find that when i'm speaking i do best
when i'm not thinking about what i'm
going to say and i don't even hear what
i'm going to say
until it comes out of my mouth you
become as surprised as
the audience as to what you're going to
say that is just pure
what does pure mean pure is not morality
and pure is not good there's not good
and bad
that's a whole other topic itself that's
actually the next topic i want to get
into
that's another set of assumptions that
everybody has that
to understand you have to be left by the
wayside
what we're doing here is we're trying to
focus on what is true
and that means we're going to speak as
honestly as possible which means we're
going to be vulnerable
which means we're going to say things
that are socially unacceptable
and we're going to say things that are
potentially surprising and it's very
difficult to speak
truth in a public forum and why is that
because there's an internal dialogue
which says that a person
wants the audience to understand there's
definitely that there's also a piece of
it that
society is a set of collective lies that
we all believe in so we can get along
it allows us to establish lowest common
denominator consensus so we don't all
kill each other
and we can cooperate but there are these
shared fictions that we have to maintain
for that society to function which is
fine there's a cost to that
and the cost is borne by the individual
it all comes back to dna
not genetic dna dna in one's
sensibilities the way that he is
wired and for some people's dna what
society thinks
is almost an insult if we don't discuss
truth here
then what's the point of having a
conversation if there's any compulsion
that the audience should understand and
it doesn't mean that i go out of my way
to try to be arcane
and abstract but it isn't about anyone
understanding
it's about speaking the truth now that
we've established that
prescriptions don't work and that we're
here to discover the truth
and we're looking past good and bad and
right or wrong
and we're just trying to figure out the
answer let's pick the first
thing that we're going to dive into
freedom what does freedom
mean to you freedom is freedom from the
mind
the only reason that any human being is
not free
is because of his mind it is the mind
which creates his tortures
it is the mind which creates his
anxieties it is the mind which creates
his conflicts
it is the mind which creates his rules
all that he is confined by
all that he is imprisoned by is the mind
not anything else
when i was young i wanted freedom but i
wanted freedom in the sense of i didn't
want to be trapped in the house i wanted
to be able to live where i wanted
i wanted to be able to make money i
wanted to have a girlfriend
i wanted to go to a place where i could
do whatever i wanted whenever i
wanted that's what i wanted in my mind
freedom was just getting away from
physical constraints
material constraints i got all that
stuff
i traveled with the whole world i ate
all the food i made all the money
i got all the things that i wanted in
life
yet the quality of my life did not
change that much the quality of my
moment-to-moment experience didn't
change that much
that's because i hadn't changed that
much my internal experience was still
very much the same
every time i got something i wanted the
next thing and wanted the next thing and
one of the next thing
all the same pains and tortures and
miseries were still there maybe some
were better
obviously it's better to be rich than to
be poor it's better to be healthy than
to be sick
but beyond a certain point my baseline
level
of peace had not changed that much
then i started making the transition to
what you're talking about realizing that
a lot of these traps were in my mind
but you're just jumped all the way
you're saying no it's all from the mind
from the very beginning
yes any freedom that leads to the desire
for more freedom
is not freedom if there's a bleed
you don't clean the tributary vessels
you want to look at the source of the
bleed
even if it took someone 30 years to
learn the source of the bleed
to learn the truth about what freedom
really was it would be far more
effective
to begin that journey at this very
second
as opposed to doing it piecemeal because
that'll take
900 years it is not abstract to say that
freedom comes from the mind
what it is is revelatory the belief is
that anxiety and fears and pain
arise from circumstance that they arise
from other people
as long as that belief is invested
inside of someone
he will spend his life trying to change
circumstance
and that will be a monumental waste of
life and you only get
one so quite frankly there isn't enough
time to go piecemeal
it is far better to not understand than
it is
to go piecemeal because then you're
going down a tributary
and that tributary leads to other
tributaries very soon you're way off
course
what we're really talking about here is
that all of the problems that we
struggle with
we tend to externalize we tend to solve
them in the external world
and there are certain ones that are
practical in the external world do i
have food do i have shelter
those kinds of things but beyond a
certain basic
level a lot of the problems we're trying
to solve in the external world
are actually internal problems and even
if we manage to solve
the current manifestation in the
external world the new problem will just
pop up tomorrow in the external world
everyone's looking for truth whether
they profess to look for truth or not
and the evidence for that is that
everyone is looking for a way out of
their problems
if they weren't then there wouldn't be
14 000 prescriptions on every single
corner
from spirituality to self-help the very
fact that those things exist
and the very fact that they are
populated by millions
means that there's an enormous appetite
for
relief from problems this relates back
to prescriptions
no human being actually wants to be told
what to do
there's something within a human being
which rejects the idea of being told
what to do
quite frankly even when you do give
prescriptions
most don't follow it and they will beg
you for years to get the prescription
and when you give it they won't do it
people look at that and say see
you've been given the prescription you
didn't follow it that's your fault no
it's not
the fault is believing that that's what
they really wanted
it's not no one wants prescriptions
freedom really is what everyone is
looking for
it is just that they've been sold many
lines
they've been sold many lies that it's
about
meditating and it's about practicing
mindfulness and it's about doing all
these things
and none of those things are wrong it's
all about the question
if your question is i like to feel
better for 20 minutes a day it gives me
a sense of peace what can i do
there's nothing wrong with that if the
question is
i really want to have peace in my life i
don't want to have
problems every single day my entire life
is spent putting out fires i don't want
that anymore
that's a different question then those
prescriptions are invalid
for that so what is the most important
question
i would begin with the one that's most
acute for a given individual
now broadly speaking everyone's problem
is
problems anxiety fear concern
worry conflict confusion
this persistent non-specific anxiety is
probably the single
most common human condition that most
people are trying to get away from
yeah and the naive version is i have
anxiety because i don't have
enough money so i need to go make more
money then the slightly more
sophisticated version is
boy i wish i could just get over the
anxiety of feeling like i don't have
enough because
practically speaking i have enough but
at some reason i'm still anxious
so i'd love to get rid of that anxiety
what's the next level after that
it's a more fundamental level the next
level is zero
the idea that someone should get rid of
anxiety is the problem
the problem is not how do i get rid of
anxiety the way
is actually to learn where anxiety comes
from the people who have conquered
anxiety
are the ones who had a clear
understanding of what it is and where it
came from
the solution to a problem is never the
solution it's always the problem
the solution to any problem lies
squarely deep within the problem
there are not two things there's only
one everyone is taught to look for
solutions
and they believe that the solution is
independent of the problem
but ingeniously nature has hidden the
problem
inside the solution and maybe it did it
because it wanted human beings to look
inside the problem the definition of the
problem
is the key can we go through a specific
example
absolutely so in the case of anxiety a
person asks how do i get rid of anxiety
their problem isn't that they have
anxiety the problem is that their
anxiety will never end as long as they
look for a solution to it
well if i don't find a solution then i'm
always going to have anxiety that's
correct
the solution is to go backwards is to
look what actually
is this anxiety put a name on it when
does it arise
what part of your body does it arise in
in what situations does it arise
know the face of anxiety not run from it
like a boogie man
this is something that's been solved on
an individual basis there's no solving
it is simply the understanding the
solution to any problem
lies diving deep into the problem the
answer lies
in the anxiety every single thing that i
say is fraught
with peril because the prescription
givers have hijacked the english
language
they've already attached an image to
every single word that i use
when i say that you have to look into
the anxiety
where that will go is thanks to the
spiritual jargon
what they'll say is i must face my
anxiety no
no you don't oh that means that i must
watch my thoughts
no no you don't why because
if you do that you'll be doing so
prescriptively
you'll simply become an automaton who
sits there and watches his thoughts
and then you will say i've watched my
thoughts nothing changed
i went into the anxiety i faced it and
nothing changed
the prescription is so subtle that any
attempt to follow it
removes you from the solution even as
you're listening to my words it isn't
about finding out what i'm telling you
to do
it is about understanding and through
understanding
you can take your destiny in your own
hands
and even when i say that i don't mean to
motivate you
by telling you that you can take your
destiny into your own hands forgive me
a thousand apologies i have no interest
in motivating you because if i motivate
you
then you will get raw raw and say yes i
too will do that now and you'll fail
it is about very quiet very serious
examination of what
actually is being said never just listen
to the words
people send me all these messages saying
what is we mean no prescriptions you see
that's a prescription don't follow
prescriptions it's not about
prescriptions
go into the source of why it was being
said for yourself
it is never about the words it's where
they come from
this is what makes these conversations
so difficult even
inspiring other people is hard because
if they're inspired
inspiration doesn't last it fades it's
like reading inspirational quotes or
motivational posters you spike up and
then you crash back down
there are times where i've actually
inspired people to go and start a
business and i regret it
because if they're not inspired
naturally they're not going to sustain
it for a long period of time without me
around
well it isn't about them i would say
that the only real problem would not be
whether their
inspiration is sustained the real
problem would be
if there's a desire to inspire them
that's the non-starter
i desire in my part to inspire them
that's right there is no other
that's another one i can't say two words
without it being a whole other thing
but let's get into it there is no other
i've said life is a single player game
you're just competing against yourself
but you're mostly arguing
having conflict with admiring looking at
yourself
you're born alone you die alone how you
interpret things as purely through you
how you view the world is purely through
you
that's what i mean by it perhaps you
mean something deeper than that
there is no other means that there's no
problem outside of yourself
and that all conflict is self-conflict
these things in which pain arises from a
circumstance
aren't really caused by the circumstance
the circumstance does not cause pain it
reveals it
if someone's intention is that i wanted
to inspire him
that's a problem if the intention is
that i didn't care to inspire him or not
then that's not a problem the problem
arises
in the individual because if he tried to
inspire
then that came from a place of ego ego
isn't bad
but if a person tries to inspire someone
they're really
trying to attain significance in their
own mind
that isn't bad either the problem is it
creates problems that's the quote
madness if you did not care whether you
inspired or not
then you'd be free and freedom isn't
good either it's just that freedom
does not create problems so a simple
example
if i'm on twitter and i send out a tweet
and i do it
to get compliments i get a whole bunch
of compliments i like those i go and i
click like on all the compliments
then i get a few insults and the insults
sting and i feel bad
it only takes one insult to cancel out
dozens of compliments
mood wise just the way the human mind is
built
after you've done this for a long enough
time you realize that it's because i'm
liking the compliments
that the insults hit me they're hitting
some deep fear that they might be true
if someone calls me a hippopotamus i
don't care it's not real
but if someone says oh you're trying to
play fake guru that might hurt because
sometimes i am trying to do that
and so if it reveals something about me
some conflict and some pain that already
existed
then it hurts just by understanding how
compliments puff me up i can realize
that insults bring me back down
and the freedom comes from realizing
that it's not good or bad i can continue
to make that trade
but at least now i'm aware why i feel
bad when i see an insult
all of that would circle back to do you
really want to know
are you the type of individual who
really wants to know and understand
where these things come from because you
have a longing for getting over that for
good
one doesn't necessarily have to go
through the understanding it's helpful
to have these kinds of illusions because
that's how we function society you could
argue society conditioned us that way so
that we could be functional in
normal society but as you understand
more of these things
one of the interesting things i've
noticed is as you peel the onion
it has to be done genuinely otherwise
it's not real otherwise just another
pleasure chase
even genuine isn't a rule there's no
need to be genuine
that isn't good like humility it isn't
good to be humble
nothing is good yeah if i'm engaging in
self-improvement and i'm feeling good
about it
then my mind will eventually be occupied
with this new image of being the guy
who's good at self-improvement
and i've just created another trap for
myself it's all a shell game that's
exactly right
one thing i've noticed is that one of
the ways in which i know that i am
finding truths out is that problem is
solved for good
that's exactly right i don't have to
revisit that same problem again
because that problem is solved for good
both my internal state and my external
state
quote unquote improve they change
improve is a big word so
the more they change internally i'm
quieter and externally my life is less
complicated
you have brought up a seminal point
which is it is not about the journey
it absolutely is about the destination
you want to get to the point where you
don't have it anymore
you aren't looking for treatments you're
looking for a cure there is a
destination
it isn't about spending the next 90
years
getting assaulted and then feeling
better getting assaulted
and putting tiger bomb on it it is about
wanting to get over it destinations and
journeys
that's another lie it's not about
journeys it's about destinations now
destinations require journeys
but everything that you do in your life
is defined by the destination
the moment that you leave your house
every single day you have a destination
and the destination creates the avenue
this is one of those social lies where
everyone says about the journey the
journey is the reward yeah the journey
is
the thing that you're actually on that's
where you are right now
but if you don't get to a destination
you sort of wasted your time
well if there was no destination no one
would begin any journey
if there was no compulsion to arrive
anywhere then nobody wouldn't begin any
kind of journey
at all it is just that most people's
destination
is the prescription wearing the orange
colored robe and then
sitting in front of the incense and
having the self-image that i'm a yogi
and that
i am meditating and i am doing all the
spiritual things and that becomes a
destination in itself
that i have achieved that self-image
where i view myself that way
so what is a worthy destination oh there
is no worthy
it is not about enforcing rules
there are no rules rules are to be
avoided at all costs if one is sincere
because wherever there's a rule there's
insincerity it's like stoicism it's a
rule it can't go anywhere
it's more self-image creation everything
begins with the truth what is the truth
the truth is that in a human being's
life he has problems that's the truth
in a human being's life he has specific
problems
some problems that are more acute for
him
than for his neighbor his most acute
problems are his living reality they're
not abstract
they're not spiritual they are in his
face and he lives in that every single
day
that is where to begin so one begins
very concretely with one's own problems
there are real problems that everybody
faces and if you have a genuine
desire to solve these problems once and
for all
the way to do them is not to follow some
routine or build up some image of the
person who solves problems
it's to examine them for the truth no
matter how
unpopular or how untransmissible or
unexplainable it might be
and if you look for the truth and you
find it you'll know you've found it when
you've solved the problem
and if we go back to zero for a second
zero
is the understanding that problems
can be solved forever society believes
in journeys
society believes in endless treatments
forever
practice practice practice practice
practice forever when the whole game
has been set up to practice forever then
there is no conclusion
there is no arrival of anything there's
a way for people to see that
if you look at how we think about
spirituality and solving problems
internally it is considered to be oh i'm
just going to
work on it forever i'm going to go see a
therapist forever
i'm going to meditate forever i'm going
to read forever
i'm going to talk to a counselor or to a
coach forever i'm going to work on it
i'm on the path i'm on the journey
but if you go into very practical things
like making money
nobody says i'm going to work forever no
they're like i want to make a pile of
money
right if i'm starting a company i want
the company to be successful
i want the company to go public or to
get acquired or generate so much cash
flow
that while i'm still alive i can spend
that cash
in the money making contacts we're
extremely practical we want to make that
money while we're still young enough
and alive enough to spend it but in the
internal context we get all
spiritual and start talking about maybe
the next life maybe in heaven or in hell
or in my reincarnated life or
i'm just going to keep doing my
self-work and my self-improvement until
the day i die
and it's considered acceptable to never
arrive at destination
there's a very simple truth as to how to
arrive
at getting over your problems without
having to lift a finger
you got my ears it's all about exposure
if a person sat on his
couch for the next 50 years
his internal environment from his mind
to his brain everything within him
is a direct resonance it's like a tuning
fork
it responds to the inputs same as a
microphone
if that human is exposed to
truth on a regular basis
his ears don't even have to hear it
consciously
something inside of him will internalize
that truth
and that will become his new norm a
human being becomes his environment and
that is why it's
absolutely critical to savagely and
surgically
arrange one's environment in a way
that is in accordance with where he
wants to go
no one does that if a person is exposed
to truth on a regular basis
not prescription it's got to be straight
truth
then that becomes his norm that becomes
the way that he thinks
his brain begins to rewire itself
there isn't a single amount of work that
needs to be done
there isn't a single amount of
psychotherapy that needs to be done no
medications the human body
treats itself it all depends upon the
input
it is all about one thing and one thing
only
exposure you become that
which you are most consistently exposed
to
in a modern context the people who are
very interested
in truth and in conquering the mind and
internal freedom tend to coalesce
on reading the same books thinking about
the same things
listen the same podcast talking the same
people and even though
prescriptions don't work and no book is
going to make you
conquer the mind and listening to any
podcast is not going to give you
internal freedom
eventually at some point it does soak in
you're attracted to what you want to be
and as you immerse yourself in it you
have no choice but to become that over
time
it's like in wealth creation if you want
to start a company you go to silicon
valley or you go to a pool of
entrepreneurs you spend enough time
around them
you hang around the tech business long
enough and you'll be in the tech
business you hang around a bunch of
techies you'll be talking tech all day
so we're naturally drawn to certain
things and if we can immerse ourselves
in them
it creates inevitability to the future
and to take it to the next level it's
about titrating that environment
because any environment from silicon
valley to anywhere else while it has
the benefits it will also have the
detriments
it's about titrating out all that is not
wanted
and titrating in all that is it can very
much
be fine-tuned like a buffet i want to
talk to you about a specific issue i've
noticed with myself i've known this for
a while but it's just really bad
i don't fully understand why it persists
even though i see it
every time i am figuring something
out for myself and i'm going down a good
path of figuring it out as an example i
was reading something recently
it was resonating with me and every time
i read a sentence then i would get into
thought about
what that meant how that applied i would
have my own interpretation
it was going well naturally i found
myself
in my mind's eye lecturing it to other
people
teaching it to other people this
invariably happens with me as soon as i
start figuring something out or
understanding it i start turning it into
a tweet
or a podcast or some lecture tell other
people
and i see this over and over again in my
mind
why is it that i keep converting
everything into an
instruction for somebody else why does
it not feel real
unless i'm teaching someone else why
does that matter
so there's two things that are wrong
with that one is of course a social
thing which is you should be humble and
figure things out for yourself and why
are you trying to tell everybody what to
do
that's the societal inflicted one i care
less about that
the one i care more about is you can't
give
society the raw truth on almost anything
the moment you have to turn it into
something
in your mind that is being taught to
others you're actually weakening it
you're introducing falsehoods and
caveats
you're not facing the raw truth
necessarily but that doesn't matter
because the greatest desire always wins
and if the desire to share it and to
turn it into a teaching
is there it's there if you genuinely
want to get over that
then the quickest way there is guess
what to allow yourself to teach it
because any suppression is regression
it's just more self-conflict it's
another should
and it's slowing things down yeah so
just go right through it
don't even go through it just understand
that if you do
then you do the very fact that you
caught yourself doing it is enough
there's no need to do any more when fire
burns
as long as it's allowed to burn it'll
eventually burn out
i do not want to engage in self-conflict
i'm now very
aware of that when two parts of my mind
start fighting each other there is this
tendency that we all have to
favor one versus the other oh this is
the good part this is the bad part this
is the angel and this is the devil
the shoulds and the shouldn'ts are pure
poison
never try to reel your mind in give it
free reign
your greatest weapon is the
understanding and the awareness
of where it's going not watching your
thoughts
like a mechanical automaton it is just
the understanding
that you know where the mind is going
and that you do see yourself doing this
that sight itself has already poked a
hole
in that behavior let's talk about using
the mind to understand the mind because
this is where
spirituality gets very confusing some
people believe
that you're failing if your mind is even
running
they're trying to suppress the mind
others believe that
there's a right way the mind should work
in a wrong way the mind should work
the right mind should suppress the wrong
mind that's a classic
call it the christian or muslim or
jewish view which is
these are good thoughts and those are
bad thoughts then there's the
self-inquiry nature which is i think a
little bit what you're saying which is
the mind can be used to understand the
mind
but not necessarily interfere with it it
all depends upon
where do you want to go without that
there is no conversation
and the reason why all these
philosophies exist
is because that question hasn't been
asked right they're trying to accomplish
different things
everyone dives into the prescription
everyone's impetus
for entering the game is the should and
the good and the bad
and the should not that's the impetus
the impetus
has to be where do you want to go
because the answer to that question
will create the path so let's say i
choose freedom
okay if someone truly wants freedom
then the truth behind that is freedom
from the mind
the idea of trying to understand the
mind with the mind that's intellectual
it's irrelevant
that's just a mind-created phenomenon
understanding is at a certain place and
we're not going to label it with any
anatomy
we're not going to call it mine there is
a capacity to understand
and whether that's one part mind or two
parts mind or zero parts mind it's
irrelevant
that'll just take you on another path
forget it the understanding will come
from a certain place
it's almost like sincerity and
genuineness and seriousness creates its
own organ
so freedom comes from the understanding
of where things come from
not the conscious attempt to end them
at least for me the problem is oh i'm
more free than i used to be so i'm
making progress
looking for progress is essentially
looking for pleasure
it is the pleasure of self-image which
says i'm in a better place now than i
was before
and that's why i get excited when i get
some progress
it is not about prescriptionizing and
turning it into a rule that pleasure is
bad
that isn't truth truth is the
understanding
that the pursuit of all things in a
human being's life
are motivated by pleasure there's
nothing wrong with that
nothing wrong with it at all it's a
motivator but is it effective
if you're trying to get to freedom no
it's a different path
and it isn't a wrong one pleasure you
will always be on the lookout for when
the ship will come in
as long as one is always on the lookout
for when the ship will come in
his attention will necessarily be on the
horizon
so it's hard for me to have freedom when
i'm recording little gains
and i'm creating this image around this
person who is recording
gains and getting better that traps me
that image i'm always thinking about
that i'm always experiencing that
pleasure
then there are setbacks so if i suddenly
get angry or unhappy or i don't have my
freedom for a moment or i think i'm not
don't have my freedom
that pleasure gets withdrawn and i'm
truly unfree i'm trapped again
yes that is the game of the mind you're
back in the mind that's why freedom
really is
beyond the mind it is freedom from the
mind what you have just described is a
game of the mind
you know whatever game that is whether
it's a spiritual game or a materialistic
game doesn't matter
as long as the mind has you captured
playing a certain game it's fine
it rests in harmony knowing that it's
got you a friend of mine
said that no technique of the mind will
free you from the mind
but at the same time we're talking about
approaching this through truth and
understanding
isn't that just the mind again that's
doing the understanding or it's
something beyond the mind that is
understanding
where there is sincerity and where there
is seriousness
that is its own instrument
of examination
