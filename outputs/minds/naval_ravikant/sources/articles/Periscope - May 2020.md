hey everybody
how's the audio it's not going to be
great
because well i'm not in a good recording
location but
it is what it is all right it'll give
people a chance to come in you can't
hear me
you gotta be able to hear me if you
can't hear me this ain't gonna work
all right most of you can hear me i'm
gonna speak softly
carry a big stick and all that i'm good
circumstances considered hope you are
all well
i don't really have an agenda this is
just for those of us who are bored on
saturday evening
i've actually been doing a couple of
these but i've been doing them sneakily
i have not been posting them to twitter
and then i've been deleting the
periscope afterwards so this one's a
little less sneaky
i did post it to twitter so we'll just
let people keep coming in
for a bit good evening
all right should we wait till we hit 2
thousand
boy i'm a little uh a little
disappointed scott adams tends to have
so many more people
maybe i'm just not as popular not
sipping tea
someone guessed it last time
hold on with the questions please we're
not going to start just yet we're going
to let the numbers build up
i'd like to get to 2 000. you thought i
was a woman
that's first yeah it's either a float
tank or a bathtub
or a hot tub or a sink or a bucket
all right we're at the magic 2k we're
gonna get started
let's just keep it casual and fun you
know don't don't need to
get all super serious about every little
detail so
all right let's get going
now i'll take a few questions or topics
or whatever you guys want to talk about
i have no agenda i don't care about
anything
so i'm all good bad times would be a lot
more people early yeah who cares about
people whatever i see 2k it's good
enough for me
i need a coffee or something like that
you know scott does that as a hypnosis
ritual
he kind of pavlovian trains you said
every time you drink coffee you think
about scott adams
it's pretty clever and even though you
know what he's doing it still works
it's great branding because everyone
drinks coffee every day so now they
drink
coffee with scott every day and every
time they think about scott they think
about coffee
and of course it's a drug that's got
caffeine and sometimes sugar in it
so he's also basically tying into other
people's drug addiction
i will say scott simultaneously sip is
one of the most clever
mass hypnosis techniques i've ever seen
words of wisdom i don't know desire
suffering there's your wisdom
berry is fine barry is doing quite well
i think we're locking down for too long
if anything bears done among the best in
the country just because the
it locked down a little early but i
don't think that was it i think the main
reasons it did well are because the
entire tech community was quite paranoid
and can very easily work from home and
started doing that even weeks before the
official lockdown
what do you think of buffett's recent
annual meeting i haven't seen it you
know i
would say it's a good question i i
didn't pay attention to it
the whole point of being invested beyond
warren buffett is you don't have to pay
attention to what they do
day to day or month to month or year to
year although i wouldn't be surprised if
he was pessimistic
i i mean i love those guys they're great
but they are getting old
and the world is evolving i mean look at
how late they were into apple
i just read jed mckenna and my mind is
blown yes jed mckenna is a mind blower
when do i think the world goes back to
normal uh
normal-ish when we have a vaccine or
immunity and
you know at the current rate will
probably hurt immunity end of the year
or early next year
after the current winter but it never
quite goes back to fully normal maybe
we're in a cold war with china
globalization supply chains collapse and
a lot of essential
manufacturing gets pulled back in you
know we have very different views on
borders and immigration
and universal health care and gun
ownership after this so i expect it will
be a very different world
after this ap just reported shots fired
across the dmz
thought that would suck you talking
about the north korean south korean dmz
that'd be that would not be good news
that is one of the worst borders in the
world
sorry i made some background noise
kids are going to bed what does it feel
like to be a billionaire
i wouldn't know i'm not one i'm not even
close i don't know why people think that
i was an early investor out of small
funding to some hit companies
and i've made good money here and there
i don't have to work anymore i'm
probably neither of my kids but i'm not
a billionaire nor do i want to be you
know there's a point at which
you get so much money that other people
start insisting they know what to do
with it and you know they start asking
for things or demanding things and
you feel obligated to do things and i'm
at the perfect level i'm at the level
where i don't have to worry
but nobody else can really bother me
because i can't really
materially change lives for huge numbers
of other people
just using money
too many messages why would elon tweet
about his stock high i think he's just
being honest he doesn't want to stock
too low or too high because either one
causes problems
if people buy too high then they put too
much pressure on him it's unrealistic
and if they buy you know it crashes down
low then his current show holders are
not happy
i think elon is fantastic i think he has
guts
and i think he's also just incredibly
capable he's just doing a lot for the
world
elon musk is the one person who makes me
question if i'm you know
doing anything interesting or if i'm
doing things interesting enough with my
life
name a good mckenna book uh judd mckenna
you obviously
start with the same one it's uh
spiritual enlightenment
is the damnedest thing i believe is this
first book of the first trilogy
really really worthwhile
peter zahan yeah really interesting guy
i haven't read the books i read his blog
post about geopolitical shifts i think
most of it makes sense
maybe he overemphasized the navy a
little bit because i think in this day
and age of
drones and bioweapons navies just aren't
that
great anymore but what have you learned
about yourself in the past year
i've actually become much more of an
introvert
in the last year or not become i've
embraced my inner introvertedness so i'm
much less social i even tweet less
believe it or not i talk less i hang out
with people less i see people less
obviously covet accelerated that
but i've just become very comfortable
just being
you know at home i like it like even if
there was no pandemic i'm still
let's put it this way the pandemic
really didn't change my life much at all
there were obviously changes around the
edges and some paranoia and some
having to you know control who you see
but my daily routine is still very
similar
one must rant about selling off
possessions what is he up to well elon's
a multi-billionaire i mean he's always
got unlimited
cash in the bank credit cards you know
and like people following him around
briefcases full of cash and helicopters
and bodyguards and stuff so
it's not like he ever has to worry about
getting anything so he doesn't need
possessions
look i i didn't even own a house until
quite recently so you could almost put
me in the same camp
certainly if i were like him and you
know i was kind of had a girlfriend but
not like a family that i was living with
then i would probably choose the same
lifestyle
but i'm a very happily married family
man with a very good life
any real threat to this food supply no
that's just overblown that's just the
media
click baiting oh all of the
comments just vanished one moment people
uh let me figure out how to get the
comments going again here
come on periscope make comments go
hmm i can't see any of your comments
that is not good
i'm going to fumble around with this
hoping to see your comments and
let's see no periscope
is this is not this is not the best
designed app in the world
i'm going to try something once again
test
okay there we go because i said
something now the comments are back
so here they go do i consider myself to
be cool i mean cool is not a judgment
you can make about yourself other people
think you're cool
cool is to me what cool is is someone
who
almost breaks the rules or breaks the
rules and gets away with it
right that's the definition of cool so
what i've been doing during the
quarantine
too much twitter and
that was bad a lot more work than i
thought i would be doing
working quite a lot because a lot of my
companies have going through various
situations obviously
so too much work but i've consistently
been doing meditation and
exercise and spending time with kids and
reading
best book by krishnamurti i started with
think on these things
i think it's an interesting read it can
be very confusing
none of his stuff is simple
unfortunately i think the book of life
is probably his simplest read but even
that one
it doesn't really grab people
in the vault 2024 no i'd have to be
insane to run for office
they just shred you they destroy your
life
i've read any fiction lately i try but i
find most fiction boring
i'll do sci-fi i was rereading some
borges recently i was
rereading ted chang's second book
favorite book is hard
because a book is a conversation between
the reader and the author giving
somebody a book recommendation
you really need to know where they're in
their life and what they value and what
they're ready for
the same book 10 years earlier 10 years
later might make no sense or be
life-changing
so book recommendations are hard i don't
like to give book recommendations
because they're really just a snapshot
of where i am in my
life and i don't know if it's
necessarily appropriate for you
that said people drag them out every
once in a while also keep in mind that
the absolute best books
the books you want to be reading and the
blogs you want to be reading are
socially and politically so incorrect
that no one will ever recommend them to
you
you have to hunt them down on the dark
corners of the internet without falling
into conspiracy theories because those
are a thing too
you can land in you know pizzagate and
satanic rituals and
all that conspiracy theory so you should
be very careful when you go researching
on your own
but what i look for is i look for people
who are scientific and logical
but yet we're talking about topics that
are normally not talked about and
they're crossing lines of expertise and
they tend to be these broad natural
philosophers
and they'll talk about anything and you
can find them on the web that's been
hiding these days
there used to be a lot more out there or
they used to be much more visible before
the web went so mainstream
what i said someone picks on me for
being a political yeah it's just a tribe
member and they're infected with a virus
they want to infect me with that virus
that's all it is
they're they're poor thinkers so i don't
have to say anything to them because i
don't value their opinion
and if i don't value their opinion why
do i have to say anything to them
they're just like barking dogs
who do i admire i admire elon musk i
think he's admirable
admirable is a big word i don't know if
i admire my everyone's flawed is a
problem nobody's perfect
there's nobody i've met who i would
rather be so in that sense i don't look
up to anyone there's no one for me
that i'm just like oh i wish i was that
person i don't think i've had that
feeling in the decade
ever since i conquered envy then
admiration goes away
and conquering sounds like a big word
it's not even conquer i just realized
it i was an envious fool for 35 years
making myself unhappy
but then i just realized that envy
doesn't make sense because you'd have to
be willing to swap yourself with that
entire person's life
you can't just pick and choose the
imagined part that you're hallucinating
or seeing
you have to realize that what they have
and what they are only makes no sense in
the context
of their entire life so when you're
envious of someone's money you say well
would i have his life
would i have an internal attitude what i
have emotions what i was parents
would i take his you know limp would i
take his physical body
if you're willing to do the full-scale
swap then yeah maybe you have a reason
to be envious
but if you don't then you're just
imagining things you're trying to swap
yourself
with a false image that doesn't actually
exist anywhere in the world
when i realized that i realized i'm
exactly where i want to be
i'm the best person that i want that i
could possibly want to be
i should teach philosophy or religion
religion is personal
philosophy is personal i don't think it
can be taught all you can do is inspire
people
the problem with teaching philosophy is
suppose that i knew
what a wiser person than me was and i
know people who are wiser than me so
that's easy for me to imagine and if i'm
your philosophical teacher
then i have to teach you not only what i
know but i
teach you what they know because they're
wiser so they know more
but if i'm not as wise as them that
means i don't truly understand that
material
either i have to pretend like that
material doesn't exist
or i have to just not teach it or i
teach a fake version of it or i have to
attack it
so it creates all these strangenesses
really the single wisest person in the
world
is the only one who has the right to
teach anyone and if you were that wise
you would realize that everything is
fine as it is
and you wouldn't say anything the wiser
you are the less you speak
if i had enough wisdom i would just
check out completely that would
disappear from public life
nobody would ever hear from me again
that would be true wisdom and i know i'm
not that wise because i don't do that i
play the silly fame game
with all of you because of that i'm not
qualified to teach anybody
how to argue against nihilism why argue
against it examine it to see if it's
true
the problem is you're basically saying i
have to speak against nihilism
but i can't think of a good argument for
that and why are you against it
maybe nihilism is true follow that to
its fully logical conclusion
if you really want to see the truth then
you just go looking for the truth
you don't go over the preconceived
notion trying to justify anything
how do you overcome irrational desire
the answer is right in the question
you overcome irrational desire by seeing
that it's irrational
what is the reason for desire so you can
feel better about yourself
then ask yourself when i desire do i
feel better about myself or do i feel
worse about myself
to ask the questions to answer it i
don't teach to teach anybody i don't
want to teach i'm just talking
if you think i'm teaching then you're
hallucinating
do i believe in living in the nile yeah
but you can't force your way there the
now is just where you end up when
there's nowhere else for your mind to
run to
as long as your mind is running to
places the now will just be
an idea and you can pass through it once
in a while but you're either obsessing
about the future
or you're reminiscing over the past and
once you get through both of those
then you just spend more time in the now
do i see a virus relapse and economies
open
yeah i do because we didn't squash it to
zero but i don't think we have the
ability to so i think we're going to end
up like sweden
whether we like it or not where people
are voluntarily staying inside
and out of trouble but it's not a
government-enforced lockdown
irrational belief do i hold one good
question is if they're if i knew they
were irrational why would i hold them
because they give me something more than
i care about reasons i will admit to
having political views
and i'll bet some of them are irrational
because politics just goes in tribal
bundles
but i don't fall neatly into political
camps anyway so
maybe they're they're not all irrational
advice in coping with the loss of a
loved one i'm terribly sorry it's not
it's not a words thing words aren't
going to get you through it
if it helps the most interesting things
i've heard in the topic
are one is you know just realize that
your grief
is a you know it's an acknowledgement of
of your love for them so it's okay to
grieve
just realize you're sending them love
that's what it is it's just
all the love you have for that person is
too much for you to hold inside
because that person is now gone that
love has to come out
and the more love you have the more
you're gonna grieve
and it's just gonna come right back out
so it's fine to grieve
on the other hand i would say it may
also help you to really think about your
own death
not in an academic way not in the in the
passing way but meditate under a
contemplate or sit for an hour and just
or go for a walk and think about what's
going to happen when you die
i think that may help put things in
perspective so
those are two things i've heard or
thought about that might be helpful
do you have any tips on meditation for
beginners i have a thread up on
medications you have to search around a
bit for it but
i've posted it many times it's very
simple very very simple
this is the problem now these days even
when you say the word meditation
everyone picks a tribe like vipassana
versus tm
versus breath versus 10 minutes a day to
versus 30 minutes a day versus an hour a
day and now they're meditation coaches
the meditation school the meditation
instructors
it just turns into this giant show-off
contest you can't even talk about it
anymore i don't even like to refer to
what i do is meditation
i need to come with a new word for it
but it's not meditation it's a thing
that works incredibly well for me and
i've told people about it
quite a bit and now a lot of people are
doing it and posting up tweet storms
about it
seems to be getting some traction and if
it's making their lives better great
but i can't call it meditation it's just
you sit there for an hour a day
surrender to whatever happens no
resistance threaten yourself
one hour a day eyes closed dark place no
app 60 days in a row that's it
that's literally it you could sit on a
chair you could sit on the moon
you could sit in your basement you could
sit in the back of a car it didn't
matter
am i investing in the stocks right now i
always run fully invested
for better or for worse that hurts me
and crashes helps me in booms but
overall i'm a bull on humanity and i'm a
bearer of my ability to figure out in
the short term
when to buy and when to sell so i just
always run fully invested
i keep very little cash cash is the
thing that the federal reserve is
setting on fire
you know to try and force you to go out
and do things
they'll destroy it eventually so why be
why be in cash when that happens
there will come a day when cash will go
to near zero
long twitter i'm long twitter the
product there but their their censorship
is actually getting really annoying it's
not going to hurt their stock
but it really makes me want to look for
an alternative
and i'm sure other people are thinking
the same way i just don't want to
build invest a lot into a platform that
can just disappear
or make me disappear i should say
thoughts and precious metals
they don't do anything they just sit
there they're not a great asset class
they don't earn anything
they're only good for when cash goes to
zero and in those cases
you can also use other things like
crypto or
real estate to cover that eventuality so
i thought some bitcoin in the current
fed environment
well the fed is printing a lot of money
which normally would be amazing for
bitcoin
but right now the problem is that we're
going to a heavily deflationary
environment that's why oil is sold
though so
the fed is trying to compensate for
missing demand in the economy the
question is if they'll overshoot or not
probably not we could see cpi consumer
price inflation for
scarce goods like toilet paper and
cleaning supplies and those kinds of
things
and 95 mass we've obviously seen huge
inflation there
but uh longer term no i don't i don't
see the inflation because i think we're
heading to a deflationary environment
we might get inflation along into the
curve eventually as we try to pay back
all this debt
but within the next two years it's very
deflationary after that it could be
inflationary
which world leader can guide us to peace
no world leader can guide
their populist to peace as long as their
populist itself is warlike
so the only way to be peaceful to have a
peaceful country or peaceful world is to
be peaceful yourself
and don't forget that the urge to change
the world is a fundamentally
violent urge because you would change
the world and improve it
as you think even over the objections of
others if you have to pass a law they
don't agree with it's the same as
threatening to throw them in jail
so unfortunately until we're all
peaceful the world won't be peaceful
and we're not peaceful if everyone is
short cash does that mean it's priced in
i don't even buy short cash short cash
should be long
assets other than cash
and it doesn't make sense to be in cash
except for liquidity needs
cash is purely there to be a means of
exchange
otherwise there's no sense in holding
cash if you could perfectly allocate
money
let's assume you had access to every
kind of asset
and if you were perfectly omniscient
being and you were asked to allocate a
portfolio
you would literally only put in cash
what you needed for the next week
or the next few days because everything
else you would have
set up in assets that would be earning
but would be hedged against each other
and account for all possible situations
and also just be automatically
liquidated as you needed them
so even if one thing went up another
thing would go down and everything would
balance out
but you'd be earning assets to be
catching the maximum compounding
available
when you go to cash what that reflects
is uncertainty
that reflects lack of knowledge when we
run to cash is because we don't know
what's going to happen next we're scared
and want to keep our optionality open we
want to be able to go in either
direction
but the better hedge portfolio you have
the better constructed portfolio have
the less you need to panic i didn't have
that great constructed portfolio going
in i took some losses
but i reconfigured it so now my
portfolio is really optimized for peace
of mind
i don't i'm very market neutral that way
i'm just trying to capture
kind of the fair risk adjusted gain
while remaining roughly market neutral
i just want to capture the productivity
growth of american business
and the american populace how do we make
sure we speak clearly and simply
well don't try and show off to people i
would say if you're speaking for other
people
then you're more likely to embellish if
you're speaking for your own
understanding
then you're more likely to speak it not
only
truly but in a closer to honest way
if you want to realize the truth for
yourself just speak to yourself don't
speak for other
most difficult aspect of being a father
you just care about them so much so you
worry about them
and i don't want to worry about someone
else
i don't want to worry about more people
but there's nothing bad about it it's
great
how do you live a life without regret
well you should never have regret anyway
i mean you didn't plan any of this you
didn't pick this
life this body what happened to you you
didn't even know why you're here who you
are how you got here what the point is
since none of that is true how can you
possibly have any regret
suppose i was born a 17th century and i
was born in japan
and the whole time i fantasized about
being a 13th century persian poet
well of course i can't get that life i
didn't pick it that sounds like an
extreme analogy but
that applies to everything you didn't
pick any of this
how can you regret over something that
implies that
you had some choice in the first place
that you have some understanding of what
it is that you were supposed to do
that there was a right answer there's no
right answer the only
right answer is utilitarian it's you
figure out what you want out of your
life
you're playing that game with yourself
there's no objective you should have
done x
it just boils into self-awareness if you
know yourself well
then you know that you're doing whatever
you want at all times that's exactly
what you're doing exactly what you want
at all times so there's no need to have
any regret whatsoever
regret over how you act in a situation
messing up a date with someone you like
no there's no regret there's only
learning you know you
messed up in a certain way but there's
so many ways to see that
are you sure you messed up because you
were just being you
and if you being you wasn't good enough
then you're
saying i should have faked who i was but
if you faked who you were you could end
up in a bad relationship
where that person is dating some
illusion of you which you can't hold
together all the time
when that illusion falls apart you start
fighting so
all you would have done is block
yourself from what you were meant to do
i wouldn't have any regrets over that
situation plus there's such a minor
inconsequential thing in your life
if you were regretting oh i ran over my
kid by accident or
i made that really stupid investment i
lost all my money
or i smoked too much and i caught cancer
like okay
those are things that we can talk about
those are difficult
but messed up a date who the hell cares
dude
life is long a lot of optionality out
there keep moving
nondualism uh it's great but you have to
actually feel it not just read it
or think about it if you don't feel it
then it's not real if it's not real then
how much is it going to change your life
anyway people who speak in
overly complicated ways they use overly
complex language
they're just scared just trying to show
off they're trying to establish
authority they're trying to
say look i deserve to be up here the
reason they're doing that is because
they care what you all think
about them if you don't give enough what
anybody thinks
then you can speak very simply because
you're not there to impress them
my goal is to make you laugh if i made
you laugh i'll tell you the truth then i
consider myself a
pretty good comedian pretty good comedy
like george carlin he was great that way
he would laugh by
telling you the truth coding boot camp
or cs degree
oh cs degrees sure is true artificial
intelligence even possible
uh yes i don't see why not
everything that is not forbidden by the
laws of physics
is possible it's just a lack of
knowledge
that prevents us from putting together
the machinery and the energy to do that
ai is possible now there are elements
within ai that may not be possible like
this whole
concept of an ai that self improves at
ridiculous speeds
yeah it could improve faster than us but
it would have to hack its physical
environment also which would limit its
own improvement
even the initial data set that is
scarfed up from us it would have to go
get more data which means we have to do
scientific experiments
so i do think there are limits on how
fast an ai can grow itself
maybe we're evolving towards that but i
don't think we have any idea how to
build an ai i think it's a qualitative
not a quantitative problem
throwing more computers that isn't going
to solve it emulating the neuron doesn't
work because the cells that it's
composed over far more complicated doing
too much computation to emulate in
software for the next 50 years
so the ai revolution is unfortunately
overhyped
how quickly do i change my opinions i'll
change them in the same conversation
sometimes just for fun sometimes because
it's easy to see how you can hold either
side
and it makes sense
thoughts on osho osha is really
underrated he keeps getting a bad rap
country documentary instead of the
latest hit job on osho but you know what
if a lot of people are saying don't read
somebody but yet they somehow seem to be
popular
go read them because when the polite
path of society or the polite majority
of society does not want you to read
something
you know that this person has said
something to true
that has angered them in some way i
absolutely recommend reading osho i
don't recommend
joining an ashram or following a guru or
giving them all your money
but just read what he wrote and see if
it makes sense to you bush is brilliant
he is absolutely brilliant
even if all he was doing was running a
cult religion you should read him just
for that
he should be like wow why do they give
him all this
what did he say it is it does make you
think you want to know
so your curiosity should drive you
towards it and if it doesn't it doesn't
but i feel like osho
had a lot to learn i am a much better
human being for having read osho
and i know that's not a popular point of
view but you haven't read osho so until
you have don't talk
thoughts on financial astrology
astrology is nonsense so anything plus
astrology is still nonsense
sorry if i burst your bubble on that one
but save you some time maybe even save
you some money
why isn't there a virtuous counterpart
to the brothers
they actually do things that would be
considered virtuous that they're coming
from the other side but they don't get
any credit for it
so i don't think people are even-handed
about it it's just like soros can't do
right by the right the koch brothers
can't do right by the left
once they if they've been assigned into
tribes and into sides
everything that is evil so there's
there's no fairness
that's your political mind spinning
what helped you become so articulate i
read a lot
i didn't have friends growing up i just
read so reading builds your vocabulary
also the things that i talk about i know
them pretty well i've thought them
through
repeatedly or read a lot on them and and
when i read i don't just read and
memorize i just read and try to figure
out what they're saying and
how it works because i'm genuinely
curious because i'm only reading what i
want to read
i'm never reading something because it
was recommended or because someone
forced me to or because
i think i should because it'll make me
somehow a better or smarter whatever
person i just read because i enjoy it so
because i enjoy it
if i'm reading it any concept that i
understand i'm going to work through and
i'm going to figure it out
so that helps me become articulate how
do i prep for my bcg interview bcg's
boston consulting group it's a
management consulting firm
like mckinsey do yourself a favor and
find something else to do with your life
and go to bcg i mean nice people but
you're not doing anything useful with
your life it's a stepping stone i
suppose and
if your heart's set on it don't prep you
can't change who you are just be who you
are
just be honest if you're not meant to be
there you then don't go there
if you're not ready if you haven't
become the kind of person that's ready
then
there's no cramming because they're
trying to actually figure out who you
are
and you're trying to figure out who you
are as compatible with who they are
how do you think someone who has
everything well i mean by showing up and
being kind and smart and interesting to
talk to those are all good things
the only thing that bothers me these
days i may stop tweeting okay
that's not true i may stop interacting
on twitter
i just realized that the one remaining
source of unhappiness in my life
is just dealing with all the nonsense on
twitter where if i put out any tweet
then i just end up getting attacked by
all these idiots who are strawmanning or
nitpicking or hating i can't engage
anymore on twitter
it's impossible to conversations without
just running into too many idiots
i may just go to broadcast only mode on
twitter where i just
put a tweet out and then i just don't
respond to anything i don't read the
replies
i don't respond to anything yeah why
does it affect me i mean it affects me
i'm still human i'm not
enlightened it affects me a lot less
than it used to but at this point if i
put out a tweet on average it gets to
300 replies
this is a lot to go through per tweet
and sometimes i put a two three four
five tweets in a row
i just can't scroll through all of them
can you scroll through a thousand
comments and
read them intelligently and you know
just and respond to the ones that need
to be responded to
i started blocking a lot more people but
i can't keep up even then
twitter with mods would be amazing yeah
i can get somebody to mod my twitter
just don't read comments the problem
with not really comments is i'm
on twitter for the conversations that to
me
is more than half the value it's because
i met some really cool people through
twitter i learn things i have good
conversations
i could ignore them but then i lose out
on the ability to have good
conversations
and it's not fair ninety percent who are
genuinely
interesting and interested in what i'm
saying the 10 percent who are
the 20 who are just ruin it this came
from someone asking what they could do
for me
here's what you can do for me if someone
on twitter is being a complete troll or
a hater
call him out on it because that helps
people behave
because these days i can't even find all
of them to block so if someone calls
them out
like i'll block them and then the people
that i hate the most are the ones who
start going into like well if you are
blocking people you're just going to end
up with an echo chamber i'm losing so
much respect for you neva
because you're blocking people like dude
you have like 50 followers
when you have you know 800 000 followers
then we can talk right then you
understand what i'm in but the large
accounts don't engage with people at all
and that's really sad
and i don't want to be that large
account that doesn't engage with anybody
who's
in my mentions it's too elitist for me
and it ruins
part of the draw of twitter if not most
of it
so i want to be able to keep engaging
but to do that i have to be very
aggressive about blocking
and then lots of people get triggered i
may have to move to a private thing like
discord but
discord's not really designed for this i
just jump in when i feel like it
i don't want to make a commitment to
always be active on something
if i want to disappear for a month i
disappear for a month see it's
interesting somebody asked earlier about
elon's thing about dropping all his
possessions
of course he's got a gigantic bank
account so it doesn't really mean
anything
but i would say i have dropped most of
my mental possessions
so i don't have to show up for work i
don't have to show up for a meeting
i don't have to i have to do anything i
work very hard
on lots of things but my schedule is
almost completely optional
if kovid wasn't going around i could be
in
thailand tomorrow for a month by myself
or with my family if i wanted to be
i could be doing anything i wanted
anywhere in the world my world is very
free
what i've done is i've dropped a lot of
these social bonds and obligations and
pressures
that require you to be in a specific
place at a specific time that took a lot
of work don't get me wrong it's not
something i
recommend for everybody but if you're
there and you can do it do it
it would have been easy to do when i was
younger but you know it's still doable
when you're older it just takes more
money and more willingness to break
social ties
because of that i'm already very free
and i don't want to commit to anything
oh i create a discord server and
if i don't want to show up for a year on
a discord server server
then i won't show up for a year on a
discord server i don't want that
obligation
i don't want any obligations no partners
no employees no bosses
just be completely and utterly free how
do i get there completely free
well i'll be honest with you one you
need to make enough money that you don't
think about it so if you keep your
expenses low that amount of money is
lower
so keep your expenses low make as much
money as you can
read my how to get rich tweet storm but
i'm happy to talk through specifics if
something's confusing
get rich keep your expenses low and then
don't get socially
i'll just make it incredibly clear to
your spouse that that's the lifestyle
you want to live
and they have to be okay with your doing
that it's mainly about just
disappointing people
if you're not willing to lose a bunch of
friends and connections with people who
think you love them more than you
actually do people who want you tied
into their lives and their obligations
if you're not willing to break social
relationships you will never be free
and in fact you can take that to the
extreme you have to be willing to break
every social relationship if you want to
be
close to completely free
am i married yes do i ever get lonely
no i have me
and sorry that may have come across as
too glib but
if i'm bored all i have to do is open a
good book
or if i'm lonely or sit down and
meditate i don't get lonely lonely
doesn't even exist for me bored yes i
get bored a lot
so that's why i'm here i'm on periscope
because i'm bored honestly
but i don't get lonely i why why is that
it's a really good question what
happened
well i've always been an introvert and i
love books but there was definitely a
time when i would get lonely i think
since i
really got into yoga and meditation i
have not been lonely i haven't had that
feeling
if you're good at meditating and doing
yoga then your most
enjoyable part of the day is the part
spent by itself
going out and socializing is a net
negative it has a cost
it's worse than just sitting at home
doing nothing when sitting at home doing
nothing becomes the best thing
then you have complete freedom of it
what do you think of me moving from
alaska to colorado somebody asks
well you picked a warmer place but
perhaps you could have gone all the way
i don't know i've never been to either
alaska or colorado i'm afraid i can't
give you anything useful on that
is it a good goal to be completely free
well if you want to be free you've got
to get over this concept of
things being good goals or bad goals you
just do what you want
so if it makes you feel good to be
completely free then
sure freedom is a great state to be and
if it doesn't make you feel good then
don't do it
but there's no like there's no reason to
do it other than you want it
it's like anything else what do you do
to self-check your self-honesty
i try to always be honest with myself
honesty somebody asked earlier what my
number one value was it is honesty it's
i just
can't be 100 honest all the time in all
situations but damn it i try
and i don't like situations in which i
can't be honest and i tend to leave
those situations
because i want to i get a kick
out of understanding things i like to
understand everything
and i don't ever want to be in a
position where
i not able to understand something
because i have to tell a lie
and when you tell a lie then you have
two choices either you believe the lie
in which case it ruins your ability to
understand the thing
or you don't believe the lie in which
case you have cognitive dissonance
because you're saying one thing and
you're thinking another
so it's taking you out of peace of mind
so i never want to lie how to be
successful and be completely anonymous
there's many ways to ask satoshi
nakamoto
do i ever lie probably but not
deliberately
like it could have happened where i was
just running along saying something and
then a lie came out of my mouth because
that was a part of me
that was still broken you know not fully
examined
so i went into some corner of my psyche
where
i had not yet accepted or acknowledged
or am being secret about something
therefore
i was forced to lie about it but usually
rather than lie these days i will just
dodge a question
so there are questions that you guys
keep asking all the time where i don't
want to lie but it's not acceptable for
me to say the truth so i don't answer
them
so that's what i do i i'm it's also part
of the reason why i've stopped appearing
other people's podcasts
because i never want to lie but there
are questions that get asked in these
podcasts
that are basically there for you to
signal that you're part of the tribe
you're supposed to only give one answer
and if i don't believe in the
politically correct accepted answer
i don't want to say anything so i just
you know it's one reason not to go to
another people's podcast there are many
another one is like
it's their podcast they should be adding
the value what we have to go build their
listeners
for their ad dollars for their podcasts
they do it i'm getting over these
interview podcasts also i run out of
stuff to say
i'm just repeating myself what's the
point i'm also not a performing monkey
nor do i want to be
do i do joe rogan again i don't think so
i don't believe in sequels
i think sequels are low quality i'll be
the next
version of myself what are the top three
companies you admire
i don't really admire companies
companies are profit making enterprises
they get paid with money it's fine
so companies are successful for the
shareholders and you know aren't doing
nasty things that are just illegal
it's fine with me they they're doing
well and they get paid like i loved
apple i've loved apple since late 1980s
i love their computers and their
products and building apple loyalists so
i'm glad they succeeded
so as a company i i admired them for the
product that they put out that their
products were amazing
thank god the computer industry from
being sentenced to a
microsoft windows hell but i admire is a
big word i
admire would imply that i look up to
somebody which means i envy somebody
and i just don't i know it doesn't
really apply to companies but
i admire certain people but again not in
an envious way
it's just like there's a part it's it's
like you would admire a nice flower
right so i think if you want to admire
somebody admire them like you would
admire a flower
you don't want to be the flower but you
can appreciate that there is something
about the flower that is expressing
itself in a unique way
that there's a certain beauty and
aesthetic to it i think the people who
are really admirable are essentially
artists in their domain like richard
feynman was an artist in physics
he was an iconoclast he thought for
himself he came up with brilliant
insights he had a
big philosophy of how to stitch them all
together people like that are admirable
the natural philosophers to me
are the people that i really like i say
that is the fullest expression of a
human being
these are people who are you know sort
of single
person almost industries as scientists
where they just create whole new
branches of science they don't limit
themselves to one narrow
thing or vertical and they're also very
broad philosophical thinkers
reincarnation there's no evidence for
reincarnation
that doesn't it can't be proven so don't
know it it's in the unknowable category
there are many other things you could
believe that are just as likely so
unfortunately even though it'd be nice
to think there's reincarnation
it would be pleasant it would take some
of the pressure off this life
i think it's a lie or it's an unknowable
thing
and so if you believe in it it's a trap
because it gives you an out on this life
believing reincarnation lets you say hey
i don't need to
you know get everything in this life
because i'll just be reborn it also
creates
a second trap when all of a sudden you
have to be a so-called good person
you can get reincarnated in the body
that you want it's anti-freedom so no i
would not go into that reincarnation
whole
is life all suffering or if it's good we
made it painful
life is just life i think i think the
mistake is not interpreting negativity
negatively the mistake is trying to
interpret it at all
what is purpose of life
[Music]
i can give you a couple of different
ones and
none of these are going to satisfy you
because the
important thing is to ask the question
and to answer for yourself
and not to depend on anybody else's
answer because it won't satisfy you
i think there are multiple answers you
give that are valid that you could get
to
one is you can create your own purpose
that is deep meaning for you to
choose your own adventure but you have
to have high conviction on that purpose
you can't waver too much otherwise you
may have regrets later
so figure out who you are and what you
want to do and go live just to that
purpose and
make it authentic to yourself it will
probably be unique to you
second just truthwise there is no
purpose the fact that you can make your
own tells you that
if there was a single overarching
purpose we would all be automatons and
slaves all of us competing in the
zero-sum game just trying to get to that
one purpose
so if there is a purpose it's somewhere
along the lines of
live the most authentic version of your
life which the same answer is number one
the third is the purpose is to just
be part of this amazing machine called
the universe i mean you have a part in
it you're a very small part of it but
you're a part of it
so you know you just play your part in
the universe and so then the purpose of
your life is just what you end up doing
also liberty the purpose of life
is no purpose it's
literally blank but
one thing that seems very interesting is
that the people who seem to be the
wisest
seem to have seen through the game so to
speak
they no longer seem they seem to be you
know as couples say is equanimous
they're they're very calm they're very
relaxed about life
and so they seem to have figured
something out and whether what they
really
imbibed is that there's no purpose or
that the purpose is to
find the truth and that truth might be
that there is no purpose but imbibe to
such a deep level that it alters who you
are
and is visible in not just visible but
but is congruent with every interaction
that you have every action that you take
when even the thought of purpose
less nest does not arise in your mind or
maybe even when no thought arrives in
your mind
then you have found your purpose so for
me my purpose is
understanding things i like to put
things together that is my biggest
purpose i just like to understand
and it's very selfish and it's fine it's
what i like to do i like to figure
things out for myself
i want to figure everything out for
myself and if i don't figure it out for
myself
then i don't have fun and it's not valid
and i can't live my life as part of it
and something i don't understand and i
just don't like to not understand
so that is the purpose of my life
purpose of your life will be up to you
okay i answered that question now i'll
take new questions i have not been
looking at the screen for a while
thank you our bigly
what causes some people to suffer and
others not
well that's a big one that's an
existential question
i could answer that i could try to
answer that i don't actually have a
great answer to that
i don't fully understand it myself so
there's
two levels of suffering right which is
one is in your mind
you're suffering over something that's
not actually that big of a deal and
there i would say it's just you know
lack of wisdom that cause you to suffer
but the moment it gets to your physical
health
or the physical health of someone that
you love or care about
or it gets to like say you know
losing all your money so you can be out
on the street being homeless or
destitute or sick or you know
attacked or those kind of situations
then then the purpose of that suffering
is tougher right that's where
christian theology and judaic islamic
theology all had to come up with this
answer that well
it's because you sinned it's because
you're sinner and so it's original sin
and you're suffering from that
and you know you have to prove you're
worthy so you can go to heaven and the
people who get to suffer go to heaven
and the people who don't suffer are
probably going to hell so that's one set
of answers
i don't find those very satisfying
there's a non-dual
medantic zen answer which is
you know it's all one thing or it's just
nothing there's no purpose to it it's
pointless
that's the zen negative side be a
negative or via positive a positive side
would be
it's all one thing it's brahman you know
it's all consciousness
and this is all just a dream so there's
no point to it you're just doing for
entertainment value
then people get into more melodramatic
like oh
you know the purpose of suffering is to
realize like your true self to work your
way up
you know to to accomplish your dharma
dharma they get fancy those are all
meaningless too
so what is the purpose of suffering i
don't know i don't know
i think it may have been entertainment
gone too far
right it's if you believe in the single
god
entertaining himself or herself
philosophy
then uh we're all broken off pieces of
that single god that are living a finite
simulation
so we don't know what we are so we can
feel finiteness
this is you know the also the alan watts
hypothesis
then we have suffering because it's what
makes the game interesting
but there's too much suffering at least
the game that i would design for myself
would have less suffering
for others and even for myself compared
to what i had in the past
but i'm grateful for it now but at the
time it felt really unpleasant
but i haven't had true physical
suffering you know that's the one i
think it's just so overrated
why give people cancer if there's a god
you know why give people cancer
that just sucks wow so many good
questions
i don't even know where to start can you
please tell all what the benefits are
after 60 days of meditation
the problem is if i give you benefits
that you're going to go
seeking them and if you go seeking them
it's going to ruin your meditation
because the point of meditation is
nothing you're meant to sit there and
just follow along and see what happens
and just
accept not even accept that's a verb but
just observe whatever's happening in the
moment
and not observe as a verb but observe as
just a fact like it's a byproduct of
what happened
in the meditation that's the whole point
of meditation and if i give you another
point you're going to get trapped in
some
fandoms phantom meteorical
falsehood something you're chasing
you'll be chasing something
if you're chasing some pleasure in a
meditation you're no longer meditating
because now you're trying to do
something you're no longer content with
just sitting and observing
so i cannot give you a go to meditation
there is no goal to meditation and if
there were
you could not meditate
you would not be meditating fantam
phantom fanta phantasm
phantasm agorical is a word the word
phantasm
p h a n t asm with an a phantasm
gorical g o or ical i believe that is a
word that's the word that i was trying
to use
sorry i wasn't trying to be complicated
but i was trying to pull up an exact
visual
like if you have ever meditated a lot or
if you've even laid out day dreaming
under the sun with your eyes closed
or if you've done you know gotten too
drunk or done drugs
sometimes you close your eyes and see
you see these crazy
visuals like it's an itunes screensaver
going or a music
visualizer playing that's that
appearance it's like a phantasm like
running around your head
that's the word that i was evoking and
during meditation yes you can get that
but not if you want it which is why i
hesitate to tell you
that you'll you may find it in
meditation
no i don't care about impressing you
random who are you
mekong man 62. well mekong man62 says
haha fancy vocabulary
trying to impress us actually mekong's
man 62 i have no need to
impress you i will never see you i don't
care about you
but you know if it makes you feel better
thinking that i want to impress you then
by all means
feel free to think that i know you were
just kidding i'm just fooling around
with you
sorry mekong man 62.
this is a dictatorship pal you can chop
your head off here that's why i like it
how do you influence people well
influenced by robert caldini talks about
this a lot it's a really good book
highly recommended
he has six techniques in the consistency
liking
uh scarcity social proof and reciprocity
of the six
and then later he adds a seventh one
which is basically around anchoring
in his presuasion book and then scott
adams is a couple as well
so there's a bunch of persuasion
techniques out there if you want to
manipulate people
but i think the best way to persuade
people
is to just be congruent in your own life
if you know what it is that you want and
you're living that life
then you only want to persuade people
with things that are congruent with your
life
and it's very easy to persuade somebody
up that
of something when you truly believe in
it when people know that you're going to
follow through with something that's
authentic to who you are
when they know that and they just want
to go along with you they want to
believe you they trust you
because you are trustworthy because
you're authentic and i think people can
can single out authenticity or tense
authenticity is so
rare in this world so rare that i think
people
know it when they see it they crave it
that's what the world is really craving
in its leaders and when they see
authenticity they will get behind that
person because they know that person
is only going to do things that are
authentic to that person they're not
trying to bring you along because they
want something out of you they're
bringing you along because they believe
in that thing
so it builds a certain form of
credibility i think persuasion
if it's done right will be a byproduct
of your authentic
behavior your authentic behavior will
persuade others
just by being you now if you
have to persuade them beyond that it'll
actually detract from your authenticity
i guess you can manipulate some of the
people some of the time but you can't do
all the time give you a clear example
like who is the most authentic human
being in recorded history it's probably
either jesus or buddha
and they were incredibly persuasive
because they started religions their
people to this day 2000 years later
who get up every morning and read
everything that jesus ever said you know
or try to read something that jesus said
because he was that authentic he was
that believable and he demonstrated his
authenticity by dying for a bunch of
random
ungrateful people i mean who does that
who are unrelated to him
buddha was authentic because he truly
didn't want anything
and so people knew oh he doesn't want
and i'm not saying by the way i'm not
before i said i don't want anything but
i mean a different way i'm saying i'm
happy with what i have
if those things were to disappear i
would not be happy so therefore i am not
the buddha
but or a buddha but the buddha genuinely
didn't want anything
and so because of that he had a level of
authenticity that created a religion
recommend your level of freedom without
having the same level of detachment or
the same thing detachment is not a bad
thing my friend detachment is wonderful
detachment doesn't feel like the
attachment feels great
because your default state is happiness
it's just covered up with all this junk
so when you're actually detached when
you know and i'm not fully detached i'm
not
i'm like i'm detached compared to the
average you know person but i'm not
the most attached person that even i
know i know people more detached than me
a few of them
and they're incredibly happy people
they're the only people
that you know if i envied people that i
would envy i don't envy them for reasons
i explained earlier but there's only a
few people that i'm like oh yeah
these people they really haven't figured
out they're even more detached than me
and they're incredibly happy people
peace happiness what are you gonna call
it real happiness comes from peace
they're all they're synonymous
so i know you don't think that but when
you've encountered and appreciated and
when you've basked and bathed in real
peace for a while then you will
understand
detachment is playing life on easy mode
not hard mode
somebody just asks isn't detachment
playing your life on but no it's on easy
mode
happiness is temporary isn't it should
we aim for joy or peace
yeah i mean peace but peace
blossoms into happiness a lot
enough that you're not craving happiness
anymore
what's your diet do you eat carbs yeah i
my diet's not perfect i try to be
paleo-ish i'm
i like to say i'm in the failure diet
where i try to be paleo but i fail
constantly
and i do a little bit of intermittent
fasting here and there
sometimes more than others depending on
how hungry i am obviously
and i try to do high intensity workouts
i try for seven days a week which means
i really get four days a week of real
workouts and then
two to three days a week of yoga and i
do meditation every day
if i miss meditation that was a big that
was
i mean i don't want to say it bad but
that was a mistake
on my part do i like jre joe rogan is
brilliant
i mean that guy was talked to me for two
hours straight
i hadn't prepped him at all so i didn't
know what he was going to say he didn't
ask me for anything
he was incredibly well informed and it's
funny because i am one of the most
present people i know
not by effort but as a consequence of
just being here
and joe was incredibly present there was
one
moment in the podcast when i lost my
train of thought and joe
never lost his train of thought he was
always completely engaged
and knew what i was saying and he knew
what he was saying he was so
on i have never met such a switched on
person in my life
maybe he was on some hard drugs haha
unlikely but you know possible
but he certainly had that level of
intensity and energy that
i did not think was achievable sober
like i'm not at that level of intensity
and i'm pretty intense person
so joe rogan is a real deal that said do
i watch the joe rogan experience
i watched the scott adams one and i
watched the elon musk one
because i think they're incredible the
interesting people
and i think that's it i don't think i've
seen any of the jres
it's not to say they're good or bad i
just don't i
don't like to spend my time
not this bad just because i find it
boring to
listen to things that i already know or
to listen to things where i'm not going
to learn something
so i'll write up to a podcast where i
know i'm going to learn something
interesting and important and timeless
something that's going to be with me for
a long time that will you know sort of
help build the structure of knowledge
that i'd like to have in my head
microdosing helps i think somebody is
suggesting microdosing psychedelics
i would advise against that actually i
think psychedelics are fine if you want
to do them
but i think microdosing is you are
altering your brain on a very very
regular basis
and that is going to change you
your brain chemistry permanently and i
think psychedelics are probably too
intense
a lot of people in psychedelics get
hooked on them not
physically not physically dependent but
meant psychologically dependent
and they view those as a crutch to clean
up their inner system
to clean up their mind and it's better
just to meditate because then your mind
is clear
all the time on its own it's not clear
because you took a drug and it's not
this artificial clear
where it's like pushed in one direction
or there's a pressure on it in some
weird way people i know who have done
you know a lot of micro dosing or those
kinds of things
they tend to become unhinged over time
in subtle ways they don't realize it you
know it starts with believing in
astrology and psychics and ufos and now
i guess ufos are mainstream but
and then they very quickly drift towards
like even stranger things so
i don't recommend microdosing don't do
anything regularly that
that can alter your physiology that much
i think it's okay to you know do
something as a as a boost
to you know go through some particular
trauma like
ssris are a good example like if you've
gone through a terrible trauma and srs
can help you
great take them but once you're through
the trauma as quickly as you get through
it get off that stuff
as soon as you can you don't want to be
taking anything except maybe vitamins
all the time and even vitamins maybe
you're just putting an expensive urine
load on your kidneys
i listen to podcasts and 2x speed no
because the only people
are listening to podcasts from are
people that are really interesting so i
don't want to
2x them in fact i skipped back a lot to
hear again what they said
do i recommend transcendental meditation
it didn't work for me
i found it to be a little scary how they
sell you a mantra
i get it they have to make a living
they're bringing you into meditation so
they deserve it but
i wish they'd just charge you without
having to charge you for the mantra
when om works just fine that said i
found transcendental meditation to be
training wheels for me it's basically it
helps you drown out the noise in your
mind
but it takes so much effort that you
can't sustain it so i prefer the no
effort method that i do which is a
non-method
you just close your eyes and you
surrender to yourself whatever you're
thinking is fine whatever you're doing
in your mind is fine
you just not even accept as a verb you
just happen to observe
what goes by in your mind and it's just
it's your mind that's it your mind being
your mind
flower just watch it that's all not even
not even actively watch it just let it
go
just let your mind go see what happens
nootropics i think about nootropics
exactly the same way as microdosing
do not take you know a drug regularly
that's designed to change your mind
because the problem with that is like
okay let's say i'm taking a drug
to change my body right let's say i'm
trying
every day i'm taking testosterone or
something like that and i find oh like
i'm getting stronger and my libido's up
but then i notice i'm getting these
strange rashes
or maybe it's like my digestion is off i
can see
something is going wrong i'm aware of it
the problem with taking a drug that
hacks your mind
is how would you know what if along the
way you lose your own capacity
to judge what you're thinking your your
own meta programmer
gets broken and that's what i think and
i don't think that's unusual i think
that's what happens with a lot of drug
addicts including on
just micro dosing and nootropics people
lose track of themselves and they start
changing in ways that are very unnatural
and disconnected from reality and so
they basically start going a little
crazy around the edges
but they will never know you can't catch
yourself and bring yourself back
so then your friend has to basically
tell you hey man you're getting weird
and a lot of friends won't do that or
they won't even know so i think
taking anything that alters your mind on
a regular basis
is a really really bad idea how does one
become wise
it's just if you were to if you care
about honesty and truth
and understanding how the world works
and you're willing to go think for
yourself
and and not this is the most important
thing
the single most important thing in life
is thinking for yourself that's
literally it
like full stop if i had three words to
give to give you as
i want to give advice so advice
this is meta advice
this advice is saying ignore all advice
including this advice because it's a
paradox
if i say think for yourself you're like
well i got that for naval from naval
thanks and of all
i'm going to think for myself just like
they've all told me to yeah it's a
freaking paradox but it is actually the
only advice worth giving
the only advice worth giving is think
for yourself but all
three parts of that phrase are important
think
which means you don't absorb you don't
just take in you actually think
uh four you're doing it just for
yourself not for anybody else and you're
doing it to change your life for the
better
you're not doing it because it's good or
because it's holy or it's spiritual it's
going to get you into heaven
it's just because you want to improve
the quality of your life it's very
practical
and then yourself it's it's selfish it's
just for you
like the moment you start to think about
other people than that society then
society is very good at programming you
to want to do things for other people
look why does society exist society is a
big cooperation engine which is
fantastic we need cooperation we're
cooperative monkeys
cooperative species but
it's also there to keep you in check
it's also there to control you to being
a good citizen a good ant in the ant
colony
you know ants and bees are more social
than us they're more extreme
but we're on that spectrum we're closer
to ants and bees
than we are you know to let's say like
you know
i don't know you get what i'm saying
like even to lizards
right lizards are very solitary animals
but even to the extent that they
uh congregate with each other they're
not going to be big cooperators we're
big cooperators so we're closer to ants
and bees
and enter a b cannot survive on its own
it needs to hive
in the same way a human maybe barely
could survive on its own but really
needs the colony that needs a society
so you need society but unlike an enter
a bee you can get much
further from the herd you can get much
further from the hive and still survive
and that's both mentally and physically
these days and if you can do that i
highly recommend it
yeah jellyfish out of feeding their
colonies you see them in big groups
mobile coral it's good analogy everyone
made a big change like moving across the
country taking a big risk have regrets
and outcomes
yeah i've taken lots of big risks and
sometimes i've had really big regrets
and
mostly good outcomes it's okay take
risks world is a big place
there's a lot of different ways to
navigate this planet you know but it's
up to you if you want to just stay in
your
shell and you're happy there and stay in
your shell but if you're ambitious then
yeah you just take a lot of risks
i don't know that wasn't a philosopher
philosoraptor i like that
okay i'm gonna go with that
philosoraptor and there's rap with an
r-a-p-t-e-r
but maybe he meant t-o-r i would believe
the dinosaur would be a philosoraptor
but it could be rap as in talk am i into
journaling
no not at all couldn't do it but if i
think of something really interesting
then sometimes i write a note to myself
on the spot but i don't do the
enforced you know 15 minutes every
morning sit there and journal
thing it's just not in me it's not it's
i mean i'm sure i could do it but i
don't do anything i don't want to do and
i don't want to do it so
can a person be effective in multiple
fields yeah i think so
maybe two but fields are very
specialized these days that's why i like
the natural philosophy route where
they're across this disciplinary but
they all tend to be scientists
scientists philosophers i don't have a
mentor
no mentors no heroes no one to admire
no one to look up to and neither should
you
i guess you could have a mentor there's
nothing wrong with that but
don't don't hang out in a mentor shadow
forever
and don't think you can never exceed
your mentor because if you think you can
never exceed your mentor then that's a
trap of sorts
i'm not an early riser i'm a late
sleeper i'm a night owl
say something to make your admirers hate
you
i feel like i could stand in the middle
of fifth avenue and shoot somebody and
choo choo train would still follow me
that was chuchu train
asking that question best osho book for
noobs
the great challenge i recommend a book
of his called the great
challenge let's see
[Music]
would you speak more about being an idol
what helps you about working at night
oh nothing helps me it's just where i
actually tend to because of my own
circadian
rhythm i think it's because i like to
read a lot
and i only get peace and quiet after
everybody else has gone to bed
and i have and no one expects an email
answer there's going to be no inbound
phone calls i don't have to answer a
text message
so i can truly check out and just focus
on the book and then i get lost in my
books or blogs and i'm up till
late in the morning sometimes reading
them sometimes when you get tweets from
me like see tweet from me at three in
the morning four in the morning
people would be like oh you're up early
it's like no i'm just up late um
i've been tweeting at five in the
morning just two weeks ago
and i'd stayed up all night just because
i read things that were too interesting
and i was digging them down and
following up on them
and so it just kept me up i could be an
early riser but
the problem is when you're an early
riser
here's the problem there's always
something for me to do there's always
someone in my family demanding attention
for something there's always like some
business call coming and there's always
some company to look at there's always
some email in my inbox that i need to do
there's always there's always something
to do
so if i wake up when other people are
awake then i will get swept up in doing
that something that just happens to me
at that time so the only time i truly
have to myself
is when everybody else is asleep so
either i would have to become
such an early riser that i wake up at
three in the morning
right and everybody's asleep and i've
got four or five hours to myself
or i just stay up late and so i just
stay up late
i don't sleep much though i probably
sleep five hours a night
i know that's not good for me
health-wise bad but i just enjoy
staying up and then you know in the
morning you can't sleep later than
eight or nine just because people make
noise and their things going on or
10 at the absolute latest so i usually
get up
after about five hours if you could have
one technical skill set that you do not
have now what would it be i would be
much better at mathematics because i
think with mathematics you can tackle
anything
investing versus starting a business
well look if you're young and have no
money you have to start a business
if you're old and you have a lot of
money you can invest instead
if you're old and you like the thrill of
starting a company or it gives you
purpose and meaning then go
and keep doing that
do i have a list of recommended books i
have i don't like to give book
recommendations because i think
everyone's in a different place that
said i'll tell you which authors
i get a kick out of i get a kick out of
the natural philosophers and that would
be
people like art devaney aleb nick sabo
even scott adams i would put in that
list richard feynman
schopenhauer niels bohr jed mckenna
i know he's natural philosopher but i
enjoy reading him osho
so i will much more like read every book
or david deutsch huge love david deutch
right now
so i would rather just read everything
these people have written and watch
every interview they've given and absorb
everything they're
trying to say rather than go and just
read some random book
and given that each of which will take
you know that's a lifetime's worth right
there and occasionally every year or so
there goes my next year so it's not
about how much you absorb it's about the
quality of what you've sort of hone in
on what you consider quality but now
that i've found this very high quality
group of authors
i could spend the rest of my life just
reading them i don't need any other
you know authors to read so i actually
put out a tweet recently on this it was
a
reply to somebody else it wasn't like a
main tweet because it feels a little
arrogant you know just to say go read
xyz especially when those people
are live on on twitter it might be
flattering them a little bit too much
but yeah i would just read a few in
ground with their bibliography
you know you don't need to ask me that
question again i feel like people ask me
that question because they're hoping for
like a single magic book
doesn't work that way i'm still here but
i don't think you can hear me can you
hear me
hello hello hello hello
lost oh it's back it's back
all right some people are saying it's
back okay
but i think it's probably time to call
it a night anyway
let's do one last discussion
one last thing one more thing
how come no video because it's dark and
honestly i don't have to care about how
i look
and i know i shouldn't care but i do all
right you guys can hear me
but am i broadcasting from antarctica no
such luck
let's find a good question
thoughts on marriage not bad
can i tweet my author list i already did
just check my replies in the last two
days you'll find it in there
with the current naval still get nervous
approaching hot girls no but
i'm married so too late
what am i searching for um
what am i searching for i want to find
the level of peace that the buddha has
found but i don't
um even that i don't know
that doesn't sound right i'm just i'm
just trying to figure out what's going
on here that's all
like everybody else i'm literally just
trying to figure out what's going on
here
i know what couple gupta would say he's
searching for a rival
or he would just deflect the question
completely
but i'm not sure that's what i'm
searching for i think i'm
still just trying to figure out what is
going on here
like all of us am i just winging winging
it yes
absolutely do i fear mortality
no only in the sense of like it might
like cut life
short and oh i wanted to figure out
something more but
i don't i don't fear it it's inevitable
death is inevitable
it's all going to zero fame is a prison
but it
sounds fun to try once you have to try
them all you have to make money
you have to get famous you have to get
the girl the guy
you have to have kids all the things
that you think that you need to do and
they're different for everybody
you need to do them it's the only way to
get over them you can't get over them
until you've done them
okay i'll tell you a little story so
in my life i've been up close and
relatively personal
enough to observe two people who
would sorry three people yes three
people who
you would qualify as desi billionaires
and
are incredibly successful people like
everyone here
of all three every single person here
has heard of all three of them
and so these are the kinds of people
whose lives you would envy
like these are the criminal crime top of
the top and
i didn't think that their internal state
was necessarily a great one i would not
want to be
in their internal state and seeing that
every time has been so liberating
because not only did i get what i wanted
but i just saw there's nothing beyond
that there's literally nothing
and if in fact in some ways those people
have less by being
more rich and more famous by being
unbelievably wealthy and famous
and so that's really useful
so it's really you have to figure out
what your genuine desires are that you
will not compromise on
and then you have to fulfill those to
see that they don't actually control the
quality of your life
although i do recommend making money
i've never been i'm not going to be one
of these people who says like
oh now that i've made money everyone
should be a buddhist monk no
i think we should all make money i think
everyone should be wealthy because it's
just a high quality
material life but once your material
needs are satisfied and it's actually a
lot less money than
people think although you can definitely
get used to a larger amount
but once your basic material needs are
satisfied then after that
nothing is going to increase the the
quality of your life
because that's entirely determined in
your head so
this is why i said that to see
what the quality of your life actually
is just spend some time doing absolutely
nothing
no music not even meditation no books
don't even go for a walk just sit there
just sit there for as long as you can
and whatever mood you end up with that
is your default mood that's who you are
and everything else is a covering or an
escape from that mood
so what you want to do if you want to
influence
or visit anything or if you want to
question anything
it's that default mood that's where you
are and that's not just pure genetics
it's not just set it's something that
does change over time
but that's the quality of your life
the quality of your life is not relative
it's absolute
circumstances are relative
who you are and and there's some people
who are manic
what was i like in college
you would not have given
time to call it good night
