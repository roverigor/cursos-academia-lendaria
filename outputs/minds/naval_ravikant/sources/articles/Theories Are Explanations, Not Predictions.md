there's another example from science
like this on a heat source
put a beaker of water then put a
thermometer into that water and turn on
your heat source
then record as the time passes what the
temperature of the water is
you will notice that the temperature of
the water will increase you can do this
with a saucepan at home
so long as the heat source is relatively
constant the temperature
rise will be relatively constant as well
so after one minute
the temperature might go from 20 degrees
celsius to 30 degrees celsius
imagine every minute it climbs by
another 10 degrees celsius but at some
point it's going to stall when it hits
the boiling point
precisely now if you're a thoroughgoing
inductivist
or even a bayesian reasoner and you
don't know anything about the boiling
temperature
and what phenomena happens at that
temperature you can join all of those
lovely lines into a perfectly diagonal
straight line
and extrapolate off into infinity after
two hours
according to your bayesian reasoning
according to your induction
we should assume that the temperature of
that water will be a thousand degrees
celsius
but of course this is completely false
what actually happens is once it starts
boiling
it stays at its boiling temperature we
get a plateau
and this plateau of temperature about
100 degrees celsius
remains there until all the water boils
away now there's no possible way of
knowing this
without first doing the experiment or
having
already guessed via some explanatory
means what was going to happen no method
of recording all of these data points
and extrapolating off into the future
could ever have given you the correct
answer the correct answer can only come
from
creativity and notice that science is
not about
predicting where the trend starts and
where the trend goes
in fact if we want to explain what's
going on with the water
we refer to the particles and how as the
temperature increases the kinetic
energy of the particles starts to
increase which means the velocity of the
particle starts to increase
eventually those particles in the liquid
state achieve escape velocity
from the rest of the liquid at this
point we have boiling but that escape
velocity the technical term is latent
heat
requires energy and for this reason we
can have heating
of something like water without any
temperature increase
that's what science is that whole
complicated story about how the
particles are moving faster
this invocation of the term latent heat
it's not about trends and predictions
it's about
explanation only once we have the
explanation can we in fact make the
prediction
