do you want to talk about Pareto optimal
Pareto optimal is another concept from
game theory along with Pareto superior
Pareto superior means that something is
better in some ways while being equal or
better in the other way so it's not
worse off in any way and this is an
important concept when you're
negotiating with somebody because if you
can make a solution
Pareto superior to where it was before
you will always do that and Pareto
optimal is when the solution is the best
that it can possibly be then you can't
change it without making it worse in at
least one dimension that there is a hard
trade-off from this point forward these
were just important concepts to
understand when you're involved in a big
negotiation in negotiation though I
would generally say that this is a tweet
that I have negotiations are won by
whoever cares less negotiation at the
end of the day is about not wanting it
too badly if you want something too
badly then the other person will be able
to extract more price from it if you do
care more about something than the other
person and they are taking advantage of
you in a negotiation then your best way
to deal with that is to turn it from a
short-term game into a long-term game
try to make it into a repeat game try to
bring reputation into line try to bring
other people in who may have a say in
the future or may want to play games of
this person in the future so an example
of a very high cost low information
single move game is your having your
house renovated you're having your
kitchen renovated contractors are
notorious for over booking ripping
people off being unaccountable I'm sure
contractors have their own side of it
the homeowner has unreasonable demands
we found problems the homeowner doesn't
want to pay for it they don't understand
there are low information buyers it's a
very expensive transaction and
historically it's been very very hard to
find good contractors and the contractor
is no choice on what a good homeowner is
so you try to go through friends you try
to go through reputation and what you're
basically doing there is you're trying
to convert a single move expensive game
with a high probability of cheating on
both sides into a multi move game so one
way to do that would be say well
actually I need two different projects
done
and so the first project we'll do
together and then based on that I'll
decide if we do the second project and
you can split your work up into two
projects another way might be I'm gonna
do this project with you and then I have
three friends who want projects done and
they're waiting to see the outcome in
these projects another one might just be
the same person operating within the
same community and having a reputation
in the community to protect another one
could just be you write them a yelp
review or a thumbtack review so these
are all ways of turning a single move
game into a longer-term game and helping
get past a position of poor negotiating
leverage and poor information
