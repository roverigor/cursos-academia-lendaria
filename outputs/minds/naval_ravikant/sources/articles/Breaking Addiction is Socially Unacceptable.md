if you drink alcohol or if you take some
kind of drug regularly tried to follow
any thought experiment what events do
you most look forward to I will bet you
there are the events where you get to do
these things so if you drink alcohol you
look forward to dinnertime or you look
forward to that party that's coming up
when you get to go out with your friends
to the bar to see how artificial it is
resolve the next one you go to you're
not going to drink at all or you're not
gonna do the drug and now ask yourself
how much am I looking forward to that
event you'll find not at all this
creates a conundrum if I give up these
sources of artificial pleasure that can
lead to addiction and desensitize me or
just bring misery down on me later by
missing them then I'm miserable because
I don't get to socialize with anybody I
don't have fun I don't go out breaking
addictions it's very hard not just
because you have to break the physical
addiction but because you then also have
to change your lifestyle to the
lifestyle that you would be happy
without that substance for example if I
want to drink because I get to hang out
with friends and be social and I'd do
that enough and pretty soon I'm hanging
out with a whole bunch of friends that I
actually would not hang out with sober I
can't tolerate these people sober I
can't tolerate these topics sober I
can't tolerate these venues sober I can
only do it drunk well if I stop drinking
then what happens I have to get rid of
these friends I have to get rid of these
activities I have to find brand new
activities and brand new friends this is
very hard and very socially unacceptable
these fake relationships and these fake
activities were just being held together
by the alcohol I realized a while back
that it's actually a problem to really
look forward to holidays and to weekends
because it indicates two things one is
it takes a joy out of me every day
because now you're living in the future
you're suffering the rest of the time
and seconds that means you have accepted
a way of life in which most of your time
is spent suffering
