another good concept is consumer surplus
and producer surplus which is the excess
value that somebody gets even though
they were willing to pay more the
product was priced the same for
everybody I get a lot of joy out of my
morning coffee
obviously I've made some money if my
coffee cost twenty dollars I would pay
twenty large my morning coffee
but Starbucks doesn't know that it can't
price the coffee twenty dollars just for
me because selling the exact same
product so I'm getting a lot of consumer
surplus out of the coffee and all
businesses generate consumer surplus
it's a good thing to keep in mind when
someone's harping about how evil
companies are Amazon might be a trillion
dollar company but I will bet you
they're generating trillions of dollars
in consumer surplus through convenience
and willingness to pay there are a lot
of people who are willing to pay more
than what Amazon charges them for all
their services
