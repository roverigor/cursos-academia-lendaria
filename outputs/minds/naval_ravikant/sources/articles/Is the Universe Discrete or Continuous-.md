you said that we went from atoms in
the time of democritus down to nuclei
and from there to protons and neutrons
and then to quarks
it's particles all the way down to
paraphrase fineman we can keep going
forever but it's not quite forever right
at some point you run it into the planck
length there's the plank
time there's the plank length there's
even the plank mass which is actually
quite a large mass
these things don't have any physical
significance
it's not like the plank time is the
shortest possible time
and it's not like the plank length is
the shortest possible length
the reason for that is because these
planck
things are part of quantum theory but
length is not described by quantum
theory
it's described by the general theory of
relativity and in that theory
space is infinitely divisible there is
no smallest possible
length or time this illuminates an
ancient
tension between the discrete and the
continuous
because quantum theory seems to suggest
that things are discrete
for example there's a smallest possible
particle of gold
the gold atom there's a smallest
possible particle of
electricity the electron there's a
smallest possible particle of
light the photon in quantum theory we
have this idea of discreteness that
there is a smallest possible thing
from which everything else is built but
in general relativity
the idea is the opposite it says things
can continuously vary
and if the mathematics requires that
things be continuously variable so they
can be differentiated and so on
the idea there is that you can keep on
dividing up space and you can keep on
dividing up time
so physicists understand that there is
this contradiction
at the deepest level of our most
foundational
explanations in physics and it's one of
the reasons why
there are these attempts to try and
unify quantum theory and general
relativity because
what is the fundamental nature of
reality is it that
things can be infinitely divisible or is
it that
we must stop somewhere or other because
if it's infinitely divisible then
quantum theory might have to be
subservient to general relativity but we
just don't know
