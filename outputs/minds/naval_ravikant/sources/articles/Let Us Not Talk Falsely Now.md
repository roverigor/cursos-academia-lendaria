great welcome everyone the format here
is pretty simple I'm just gonna bring
people up you get to ask a question and
then I'm gonna bounce you back to the
audience and then I'll discuss that
question unfortunately I've found that
other formats just don't work as well
and I reserve the right not to answer
your question but feel free to ask any
question I think specific questions are
better ones that are practical and
concrete rather than these wide-ranging
philosophical questions I think
philosophy is better experienced in the
particular than in the general or the
abstract because then it can have a real
impact on our lives and I'm just here to
have fun just like all the rest of you
and learn something and I'm probably
gonna make mistakes and much of what I
say is going to be wrong so please
interpret gently don't take it out of
context resist the urge to tweet things
that are sensationalist and out of
context and these days one of the ways I
survive on Twitter is by blocking
frequently uh with extreme prejudice so
keep that in mind one of the reasons I'm
doing a Twitter space instead of just
tweeting as much is because Twitter as
usual continues to be very combative
people like to misinterpret things take
things out of context and just straw man
everything red and Steel Man it so one
of the advantages of a format like this
is that I can provide more context
enough for the disclaimers I'm going to
mute my mic while I go through the
requesters profiles and yes your
profiles do matter and I'm going to
figure out who I'm bringing up here
hey Joseph
hi Naval how do you think about how open
source will
transform web 2 to web3 startups
companies it's a good question as I
promised even though I know you and
respective I'm going to move you back to
the audience just to stay within the
format so give me one second on that so
the question was about open source oops
I think I may have bounced it from the
space altogether apologies Joseph I
didn't mean to do that that was a little
too harsh hopefully he'll come back in
and shoot
if he doesn't I will send him an apology
later
anyway if I did bounce in for the space
I owe him an apology so the core of web3
is open source the core of crypto is
open source if you have a crypto
application uh or a web 3 application
and it's not open source and is it
really even open source in fact I think
it was Chris Dixon who said that web3 is
the business model for open source and
it's amazing to me how many people beat
up web3 without realizing that this is
the heir to the open source movement
that's found a business model and how
many of the original OSS folks consider
crypto a scam when maybe the answer to
many of their dreams so open source to
me is fundamental it's a building block
of web3 and I think that's as simply as
I can put it you couldn't have web3
without open source of course you can
have open source without web 3 but I
would argue that web3 allows you to take
your open source application actually
instantiate and run it in a distributed
format and get paid for it and let the
users own their data that's my
definition of web3 the the code is open
the data is owned by the users and the
network is owned by the contributors so
that's probably the three big
differences between web3 and web 2 for
anyone who's looking for a slightly more
precise definition than just taking web
and incrementing the number behind it by
one all right we got a lot of questions
here so I'm just going to start maybe
I'll crank through people a little bit
faster
cyan I hope that's right I notice you're
connecting
hopefully you don't have issues signed
you're on the air
hi novel thanks for taking me in so I
have a pretty simple question is with
web3 since we are on the topic with web3
what do you think like just Ai and ml
kind of found their way into the whole
ecosystem how can web3 be more
mainstream so that there's no kind of
question about it later that whether
it's actually legit or not I just want
to get this question out from move from
the students perspective if you can
answer it thank you I'm sorry I don't
quite fully understand the question the
way you're asking would you mind
rephrasing it a slightly different way
you left I think it was something about
how can you get web3 out there like Ai
and ml look these things are going to be
adopted on their own schedule web3 is
going to build lots of hopefully useful
apps that you couldn't have otherwise
web3 doesn't have to appeal to everyone
it's trying to appeal mainly to the
applications that would otherwise be
de-platformed or benefit from
decentralization or creating a Frontier
where no such Frontier currently exists
so you can have Innovation there's no
Ironclad law of software that all new
software movements have to appeal to all
people in fact you could argue that open
source didn't actually transform large
chunks of software and most users never
directly interacted with or use open
source for quite a long time but yet it
still had a huge effect in the data
center in the background in debugging
and building the underpinnings of much
of what we see on the web so I don't
think there's any Ironclad law that web3
has to go mainstream the same way like I
don't think Bitcoin has to go like super
mainstream to be valuable if it just
becomes a reserve asset like gold how
many people actually hold gold as a
reserve asset not a lot but it doesn't
take a lot for people to park their
wealth in something like that and use it
as a reserve asset for it to be valuable
so the same way I'm not convinced web3
necessarily has to go mainstream anytime
soon for it to be incredibly valued if
you just have a lot of very smart people
tinkering on the edge building apps
accepting web 3 currencies and
innovating in that whole field and
partaking in D5 or nfts or anything of
that sort it doesn't have to be
mainstream it can still be incredibly
valuable because you're dealing with
money and memes it can spread virally
and it can build and hold and capture
value very fast people have made huge
Fortunes in crypto without it having
even gone mainstream yet and I think
that Trend can continue for quite a
while and no they're not
versions if that's your automatic
response then you haven't studied it
enough
hey Ryan you're on the air hey I you
tweeted something if I could just reread
it and then maybe get your take on it
you said the reality is life is a single
player game
you're born alone you're going to die
alone all of your interpretations are
alone
all your memories are alone you're gone
in three generations and nobody cares
before you showed up nobody cared it's
all single player I mean I think about
this quite a bit myself I spend quite a
bit of time alone and sometimes it has
me thinking what's the point so I was
just wanted your your take on that
thanks yeah it's a good question okay so
life is a single player game obviously
it's not 100 True Life is also a
multiplayer game but I think it's more
interesting to consider it as a single
player game because that's not a thought
that gets brought up as often Society
always trains us for society's ends and
Society is a multi-user organism so it
will train us for the multi-user game so
only the individual can themselves
stumble upon the single player game and
that frame of mind and see where it
takes them so why is this an interesting
frame of mind firstly there's a lot of
truth to it so much of the world so much
of is your interpretation of the world
so much of mindset is your mindset to a
tree or a rock or a house or even
another person reality is very different
to an object reality is neutral to
another subject reality is subjective
from their point of view so a lot of
this is up to you how you want to
interpret it another Point here is that
the only moment that really exists is
now even tomorrow or yesterday are just
thoughts in the current moment so no
nothing exists outside of right now
you're not necessarily going to be
around for any appreciable period of
time everything you do will be forgotten
like everything in the past has been for
God it's not to say it's meaningless but
it's more to say that you create your
own meaning you interpret your own
meaning you are the meaning of your own
life
and that gives a freedom now you can
you're free to interpret this however
you want inside every person is either a
budding God or a budding demon or an
angel or a saint it's entirely up to you
how you choose to interpret it I just
recommend that you interpret it in a way
that is as close to reality as possible
because then you're likely to make less
mistakes and if you have the choice if
you must choose then interpret it
positively because it's just better to
live a positive experience than a
negative one people who commit suicide
for example God bless them but they left
the game too early they were going to
leave the game anyway everybody leaves
the game eventually so you may as well
just stick it around see what it has
planned for you why do anything what is
this a problem is the problem if there's
a lack of meaning no it's a form of
Freedom if there was a meaning to life
then we would all be stuck trying to
figure out that meaning and the moment
that a person found that meaning and
share it with everybody else then we
would all be enslaved to that particular
meeting so I think it's liberating that
there's no meaning to life you can
create your own meaning and certain
meanings that you create or inter are
far more pleasant than others some of
them can lead you directly to a life of
contemplative Bliss some of them can
lead you straight to creativity some of
them can lead you to helping other
people I would argue that the meanings
that are the best to create and work on
are the ones that self-actualize you
against your natural talents the thing
that you enjoy doing that puts you in
flow that has some worthwhile benefit
either to yourself or to society and
doesn't cause extreme negative
repercussions for you in this life and
just be aware that a lot of the things
that look like they're good for you are
actually just good for you in the short
term and they do cause negative
repercussions so long term so to me the
part of the secret of living a good and
happy life is just understanding
long-term consequences of your actions
and so if you create a meaning that long
term will lead you to compound interest
in good relationships and in creating
wealth for yourself and not having a
very busy mind and just being able to go
through life sort of Happy from moment
to moment that's going to be a better
life that you've created for yourself
but yeah if you want to create a harsher
and darker or shorter life for yourself
you should feel free to make that choice
I just don't think it's a very wise
choice the single player game frame also
robs you of this idea of Outside Agency
it takes away this idea that you are a
victim that things happen to you that
you don't have agency in your life I
think that the belief that people fall
into where they're victims there are
real victims in real circumstances but
they're far rarer than Twitter what have
you believe on Twitter there's many
budding victims who are raising their
hand crying for victimhood and all
you're doing is you're robbing yourself
of your agency you're robbing yourself
of your ability to make a difference in
your own life so even if you have been a
real victim let's just go ahead and
accommodate that for a moment I would
say it's still a better frame to
basically say no life is a single player
game I choose to rise out of that I
choose to interpret that and long term
when you look back on your life the
moments are going to be proudest of is
when you Rose past circumstances that
were difficult when you Rose past your
suffering and then you accomplish
something that's where character is
built that's where resumes are made
that's where people have their proudest
moments so if you had no adversity it
would be a really boring game imagine a
game of I don't know Mario Brothers
where there was no jumping and no prizes
and nothing to do with no monsters it
would be incredibly dull and Incredibly
boring also a game that went on forever
would get really dull so I would say
play the game it's your game you get to
design the board you just have a
challenge you get to design the victory
condition and that's a lot of the
creativity one of my other related
tweets is the only true test of
intelligence is if you get what you want
out of life and this one triggered a lot
of people which I love the tweets that I
trigger a lot of people but they're
undeniably true which is intelligence is
like this abstract concept that we talk
about but the real measure is did you
get what you want out of life and these
are two parts in there it's not just one
part one part of course is were you able
to hack reality to get what you wanted
but the more important part is were you
smart enough to figure out what to want
in the first place and that means there
are many booby prizes that simply aren't
worth having and then there are others
that are out of your reach it's
ludicrous for me to desire wings or even
to travel into a rocket not into outer
space because it's either low Roi effort
or it's unachievable for me so what I
want to do is to figure out what it is
that is worth wanting and remember not
wanting something is as good as having
it so if you cannot warn in the first
place that's even better but the test of
intelligence here is getting what you
want out of life but also knowing what
to want so when life is a single player
game you get to craft it it's a blank
canvas it's not a negative thing it's a
positive thing it gives you a level of
Freedom you would not have multiplayer
games are inherently less free single
player games are more free I encourage a
single player frame simply because
Society will not encourage it you won't
encounter it outside of the individual
and also because it gives you back your
agency and it has the benefit of being
largely true
Gabriella welcome thank you it's
fascinating listening to you I've
actually just ventured into this space
and and I'm coming from a place where
when I say I just ventured into this
space I'm part of a founding team of a
social impact platform called save a
love Seva which means selfless service
and love which means love and I wanted
to ask you because I'm really in the I
would say the collective belief that if
we bring Consciousness and have that
intention to bring it into this new
space I really feel that we can
ultimately tip
um the scales of where I would say in
real person this world is right now
for good so I I'm maybe I'm innocent
maybe I'm naive but I really believe
that web 3 has that possibility of
generating critical mass for good so
whether we're using it through nfts
whether we're using it for social impact
investment or whatever that is or
actually even having these conversations
on Twitter space I was wondering what do
you see the future as in this space
because I'm very enthusiastic by it and
I'm very hopeful I actually think that
if we didn't have with pre I'd be pretty
depressed in terms of where we're going
as Humanity
all right thanks for that so one thing I
would be careful about is mixing what is
true with what you want to be true and I
see this happening in business a lot
where a new business Trend comes up
people are excited about it because they
want to make money but then they also
start projecting all the other fantasies
onto it and I would be very careful
about that so what I mean by that is web
3 I think is really about
decentralization it's about Freedom it's
about Innovation I'm not sure it's about
Consciousness or self-awareness I think
that's orthogonal I do think it's better
if people are more conscious I think
it's better if they have more agency I
think it's better if they're more
self-aware and certainly you can use
your time and resources to try and
connect the two but I do not know if
web3 automatically leads to a race
Consciousness level now that's a fuzzy
term Consciousness it's hard to Define
so let me just go back to something
slightly more concrete which is
self-awareness which is just how much
attention do you pay to your own
thoughts your own mannerisms your own
being how much the critically question
who you are or do you just blindly
accept that everything your mind says to
you is true and just the way things are
so generally I find the people who are
more self-aware are more interesting to
be around they're less of a pain they're
more in control of their emotions and I
find it to be probably the most
attractive trait that it doesn't
necessarily follow from web3 the Press
is completely orthogonal or perhaps
there's a linkage in that web 3 and
decentralization force you to take more
responsibility personally for the
outcome of these systems that we
participate in because now you can no
longer just be an oblivious user you're
also an owner you're a Staker you're a
validator you're a governor you're a
Creator so in that sense anything that
gives humans more agency is going to
over time force them to be more
self-aware which may lead to a form of
higher Consciousness but it's not clear
to me that the two connect by default
and I would caution you to be careful
about connecting them by default because
then you may end up building a business
that doesn't actually make sense in the
real world and we want you to be
successful so that you can go ahead and
spread the Consciousness that you you
want cool there's a monkey on the stage
actually there's two sorry I was on mute
thank you very much for hosting these I
love these spaces you have very clear
thought and I'm wondering if that would
have been a hindrance to your career
earlier on in your life to be so clear
and so self-aware like you just
mentioned or or if or how do you think
that timing has played out for you
basically
yeah it's a fair question I think part
of it is age live long enough and you'll
naturally become a philosopher I think
some of it is the times themselves
people are more self-aware these days
and the language of the knowledge of
Consciousness and self-awareness either
through tools like meditation or
meditation assistant or books or
psychedelics or whatever sort of
spreading I'm meeting more and more
younger people who are more self-aware
and more conscious than I think was true
in my generation I think there's an
underlying question that you didn't ask
directly but you hint to that which is
hey can I make money now and be
conscious later or flipping it around is
being more self-aware or conscious going
to get in the way of my making money
possibly I don't want to say it as a
free lunch here because I don't think
there is some of the most self-aware
people that I know are not highly
motivated but I suspect those people
wouldn't have been highly motivated to
make money regardless I find that clear
thinking is incredibly rewarding not
that I'm saying I'm a clear thinker but
on the occasions where I do have Clarity
of thought it pays off so I wouldn't
pass up Clarity of thought for anything
look intelligence is a cheat code right
if if we're playing Dungeons and Dragons
and you had high intelligence it's
probably the thing you would want
because you can swap it for almost
anything else in the modern world
because the modern world is full of so
much leverage that smart people can
employ that leverage whether through
code or Media or labor Capital to kind
of magnifying what they want they can
make good decisions and then the impact
of the good decisions is magnified by
leverage that's really what my whole how
to get rich tweet storm is about and so
I think Clarity of thought is incredibly
valuable and I would say as I've gotten
older in business it has become even
more valuable so I do think it has
helped me a great deal in business one
huge way in that Clarity of thought
helps you is that I I do believe that 99
of effort in life is quote unquote
wasted and it's it's not wasted in the
sense that you don't learn something you
do learn something but if you look back
at all the term papers you wrote and all
the classes you took and all the people
you dated and on all the thoughts you
had and all the things you stressed
about and all the decisions you made 99
of them didn't matter if they were
inconsequential and there were a few one
percent decisions that did matter now
could you have gotten to those one
percent without the 99 no you have to do
the work to get set up for the right
decision but could you have gotten there
with maybe wasting 90 or 85 or 80 what
if you're gone from a ratio of 991 and
obviously it's a made-up ratio but
you've gone from 991 to 95.5 now instead
of 100 to 1 against you're 20 to 1
against so I do think clear thinking
allows you to make better decisions and
have better judgment and better judgment
is everything if you have good judgment
in this life you're going to thrive in
the modern world because you will be
applying judgment everywhere example is
what news do I consume how personally do
I take it do I get a covid shot or not
do I walk into this environment or not
Russians are coming into Kiev when do I
leave what profession am I going into
who am I going to marry what city am I
going to live in what workout do I adopt
what diet do I adopt these are all
judgment calls every single one of them
is a judgment call and if you make the
right judge measurements you will have a
healthier happier and wealthier life so
judgment is everything it is the
foundation of a high quality life and
Clarity of thought leads to good
judgment examples of how much I value
Clarity of thought now compared to how
much I used to is I don't keep a
cluttered mind anymore because it makes
bad decisions so if I have to make a
decision I will clear my calendar which
actually is already clear but in the old
days I used to clear my calendar and
make sure that I spent time on the
important things a clear calendar lets
you focus on the most important thing
rather than on just the most urgent
thing that happens to be staring at you
back from your calendar people will send
me explanations or emails or they'll say
hey read my blog post and I'll go in and
it's 11 pages of gobbledygook and
there's maybe like two or three clear
points in there if you cannot
communicate clearly then it is a sign
that you cannot think clearly it's like
when you walk up to someone whose desk
is a complete mess yes at some level it
reflects that they're busy but at some
level it also reflects an underlying
clutter that they're tolerating in their
lives and so is this person going to be
organized in other ways these are
signals these are indicators they're not
dispositive it doesn't mean that a messy
desk is automatically a cluttered mind
but it's an indicator so I think that
having a clear mind and clear judgment
and clear thinking is a cheat code to
life and I tend to find that there is a
correlation between people who are clear
communicators clear thinkers and have
good judgment and you want to surround
yourself with people with good judgment
because that's how you're going to win
in life in general
don't forget to unmute
hi in the world thanks I wanted to get
your perspective on pseudonymi and
accountability I I think there is
there's probably a compelling rationale
for it in the sociopolitical space but
when you're talking about financial
implications Financial models especially
in web 3 how do women pseudonym your
accountability really come together is
it a model that's really sustainable
going forward thanks
yeah so the question is about
accountability and pseudonymity in web3
and how to intersect I do think you
generally have to have a high level of
accountability to get properly quote
unquote paid because if it's not
associated with you then people will
steal credit you'll have a hard time
having good branding you'll have a hard
time getting leverage but things are
changing in the olden days being 20 30
years ago if you want a personal brand
you were talking about spending a lot of
money in marketing you were talking
about having t-shirts maybe like your
name on a tower maybe going on TV maybe
going on radio maybe showing up in the
media so there was no concept of
pseudonymity and pseudonymity is this
halfway ground between anonymity and
nomity which is being named it's a new
phenomenon that only really exists on
the internet where you can build up a
reputation and a track record but you
can put it behind a DOT if domain name
or you can put it behind a board ape or
a crypto Punk profile picture Avatar and
you can do your work completely online
so I think this is a very interesting
model it's a good defense against cancer
culture it's a good defense against all
kinds of things it puts people in even
footing whether you're male or female or
black or brown or white or what have you
are old or young so I do think it is
very powerful but I think it's emergent
and I think the pseudonymity only
applies within the narrow web 3 domain
so if you're in web 3 and you have a
reason for the pseudonymity then I think
it's a very powerful weapon and by all
means you should use it I think it's as
good as accountability it's just not the
accountability is accruing to your
avatar instead of to you personally I I
think it's a fantastic new model if I
were starting out today I would probably
have a pseudonymous avatar maybe not
because I like talking too and it's hard
to make a voice pseudonymous or to be
voice Anonymous but I would probably
have less of a revealed identity out
there that said I think outside of web 3
it doesn't really apply and it may never
apply but then again I think web3 is
going to be a very big part of society
and the economy going forward so more
and more people will be pseudonymous one
other point is there is a place where
pseudonymity is quite prevalent outside
of web3 and that's on Twitter on Twitter
you have all these in on accounts and
there are occasionally people who call
for Banning a non accounts and I think
that's a big problem of course the worst
accounts are in on the the trolls and
like the real haters and the automated
accounts and the spam accounts are
largely Anonymous but I think the best
accounts are also anonymous because they
can speak truth at a level where named
accounts can't because there is a
collective set of lies that we have to
believe a society to get along and that
set of Lies will always shifting within
the Overton and there's a small Overton
window that's always moving around and
if you say the wrong thing you can get
canceled you can get attacked you can
get ostracized or you can get just
shamed or humiliated but they're saying
true things and what's even worse now is
that cancel culture will reach back to
your tweets 10 years ago and cancel you
over that so I just think it constrains
the discourse if we only have named
accounts it constrains it unacceptably
because now those people can be punished
so for the same reason the secret ballot
isn't very important and The Gnome de
plume with the pen name writing I think
Ben frankly you swear to the number to
Plumes for example and several of the
founding fathers of the United States
did I think it's a very powerful thing
and I encourage it I do think there
should be more in on accounts not less
it's very easy to block or mute annoying
in on accounts in exchange you get
incredible truth speaking from some very
high quality accounts I think of Twitter
or whatever to do away with you know
accounts it would essentially be a much
less interesting platform even to the
point where it might get displaced by a
platform that embraced anons I'm not 100
sure about Facebook that deleted my
Facebook account a long time ago not out
of any Prejudice but just because I
found it more annoying than anything
else I believe Facebook does not allow
in on accounts and that right there
makes Facebook way less interesting as a
medium where you're going to learn
anything or encounter anything truly
interesting or off the beaten path
aniket the reading habits guy all right
kid you're on the air
so we have heard you talk so much about
reading and reading books and with us
moving into this entirely digital
generation where people are not reading
books how do you see people reading in
the generation or years to come by and
where do you see books going and the
authors going from here onwards yeah I
obviously grew up reading a lot of books
and I love books doesn't mean books are
the only medium of learning some people
learn from YouTube videos some people
like audiobooks some people like tweets
some people like blog posts at the end
of the day it's about where you can find
the highest signal to noise ratio the
books are uniquely interesting for a
number of reasons one is unlike the
synchronous media of YouTube and
audiobooks uh you can consume books
asynchronously which means that on one
sentence you can spend hour and then the
next paragraph you can spend a minute in
the next chapter you can spend a second
as you slip through it so for anyone
who's serious about absorbing knowledge
books are a much better medium they're
much more efficient and the point of
reading is is not to stack up a giant
stockpile of books that you then tweet
out and say current reading this week
look at how many books I read dumping
your chest and the point of reading is
not even to necessarily absorb knowledge
in an age of Google the knowledge is
always a fingertip away but the point of
reading is to spark your own creativity
and to spark your own thoughts so it's
almost like you're starting a fire in
your brain so a really good book has to
be read slowly if you're reading books
quickly and you're proud of the speed at
which you're reading them you're reading
the wrong books it's like lifting
weights that are way too light you're
just cranking through the exercise on
the other hand if you read a book that's
way too difficult for you and you're
just stuck and can't make any progress
then that's like trying to lift the
weight that's too heavy you can't even
get a single rep off but what you want
is you want to lift a weight or read a
book that is kind of at the edge of your
ability where you're learning more but
it's a struggle it's it's a little
painful it's a little confusing but at
the same time it's sparkling ideas and
thoughts that then you have to add your
own creativity in your own
interpretations and apply to your own
experiences to learn something the books
that excite me the most are the ones
that make me smarter they don't
necessarily give me more knowledge or
information I'm not going to necessarily
read a book on why water is the most
important molecule in the world or a
biography of a famous General but those
books are always a fingertip away I can
pull them up and you know read them very
quickly and easily if I need to or want
to but I'm not going to just absorb
useless knowledge that I can just Google
on demand rather the books that I read
are the ones that make me smarter in
fact Brett Hall just joined the chat and
Brett is a teacher of physics and
epistemology and runs this great podcast
called the theory of knowledge podcast
which I've shielded before on my Twitter
it's actually probably the only podcast
that I listen to religiously because it
makes me smarter and because Brett is
exploring this book called the beginning
of infinity which also is probably the
best book I've read in the last decade
and also made me a lot smarter I wish I
encountered it earlier but that's not to
say that reading that book is the
end-all and be all there's nothing
magical about the book format in fact I
don't think Deutsche you know no offense
to him he's a brilliant thinker I don't
think he's the best writer because I
think he's writing for other physicists
and so he's not writing for you and me
or maybe if he tries but it's hard for
him to operate down at our lowly levels
so people like Brett and myself and
others can help interpret it as we chew
on it we can digest it and pass it down
and there's a few chapters in the
beginning of infinity that are the most
interesting and applicable for normal
people and I encourage everyone to go
and digest those and it took me to
really get through the beginning of
infinity and the fabric of reality which
is the precursor to the bigger infinity
it took me about two years to get
through it and it's not to say it took
me two years to read it I'm a very fast
reader I probably can and did at some
point read both books in you know a
weekend but it took me two years to
actually understand the concepts in the
book and there are single paragraphs in
there which sent me down rabbit holes of
videos and podcasts and reading and
looking at papers and opening up a
physics textbook and so on that consume
two months at a time there was some
comment about Multiverse person is
showing the wave equation that had me in
a tizzy for quite a while and it's not
to say that I still understand all of
the beginning of Infinity but I
understand enough of the concepts that
now I've integrated into my core
philosophy of decision making and
judgment so I I don't think books are
necessarily a sacred medium but I think
they're an important medium besides just
asynchronous consumption another
important one is that a lot of the best
work that has been written especially if
you're talking about philosophy or
something that's not that modern
remember the old questions have old
answers those are written a long time
ago and a lot of the things that they
wrote down back then would be socially
or Politically Incorrect to write today
many writers are only famous after their
own time simply because their peers have
to die out and stop condemning them for
a new generation to come in and absorb
whatever they wrote objectively rather
than through the lens of this can't be
right because my current Society is not
ready to absorb this truth so I do
recommend reading a lot of old books
because I think for philosophy and
wisdom most of it has been said better
before you can always rephrase in a new
way maybe apply it to a brand new thing
that showed up but the Timeless
questions have Timeless answers another
advantage of reading it through a book
rather than watching it through a video
is the author is a little more invisible
to you and that's good because that
removes your ego from the equation it's
not like your friend next door telling
you something there's the old line no
man is a prophet in his own land and I
think there's a lot of Truth to that I
see this in my own Social Circles where
I literally sit around with 20 people
who are talking let's say about crypto
or wealth creation and I know what
they're saying is wrong but they're not
going to ask me because I'm their friend
they've already kind of stuck me into a
friend bucket so we're peers they're not
going to look up to me in that regard I
may not look up to them in their areas
of expertise so if you can remove the
speaker from the spoken if you can
remove the writer from the writing then
it allows you to absorb it with less in
the way it allows you to make it your
own and and then regurgitate it later
but again through your own lens in such
a way that it becomes a part of the
fabric of your thoughts and so I do
think that absorbing Knowledge from a
book I find it to be higher quality
absorption than if it's coming through a
speaker maybe that's just me there are
some extremely good blogs out there
unfortunately due to cancel culture and
just the decline of blogging in general
a lot of them have been disappearing off
the internet but I do think that some of
the best content and writing that I've
ever encountered was in the long-form
blog post floating around the internet
but that's a hard problem to dig through
now Google doesn't do a very good job of
surfacing blog results there was a time
when they used to prioritize blog
results much more highly the search
these days if you search for anything on
Google you're just going to get a list
of 100 Different official sources which
just kind of shows you that the manual
tweaking of Google has been taken over
by the usual trust and safety teams so
if you're going to find these good blogs
it's going to be through personal
recommendations or social media in kind
of the dark corners of social media so
again nothing magic about books but a
Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett say
that everybody that they know who's
smart is an Avid Reader and I have a
hard time refuting that I have yet to
meet someone who I've considered a very
high functioning level of intelligence
who doesn't read for fun underlying
those last two words for fun and which
is not to say that you should go and
make it a chore to start reading but one
of the tweets I'm proudest of is read
what you love until you love to read so
the goal here is not to go crack a
physics textbook immediately but just
develop a love for reading if you can
better than an early age like everything
else and if you can develop a love for
reading then eventually you'll navigate
your way to the things you're quote
unquote supposed to be just because you
get bored of the trite stuff a lot of
the same points same jokes same
observations will strike you as
pedestrian and there is a certain magic
to quantity right once you get through
enough books you just become a better
reader it's like anything else that said
the goal here is not to read the largest
quantity of books is to read the highest
quality of books I will once again plug
the beginning of infinity and I'll say
read it and spend two years on it if you
have to and listen to Brad's podcast
because if you can get through the
beginning of infinity and really
understand the core principles at a deep
level it's going to improve the quality
of your thinking so much that your
future books and blog posts and tweets
that you pick up you will be able to
determine very quickly which ones are
talking truth and which ones are talking
trash and I mean believe me your theory
of knowledge right now is not good
enough whatever you think it is you can
upgrade it as we're talking about before
judgment is the most important thing
hey Brett Brett you got a special
dispensation I'm not going to bounce you
after a question we can just talk for a
bit or maybe I'll let you talk for a bit
Ah there we go yeah people want to know
stuff don't they and so if you have a
scattergun approach the way in which you
approach books then you might be going
for breadth rather than depth and the
thing about depth is that depth has
inherit breadth it has breadth because
the deeper the ideas the more different
subjects those ideas are going to touch
and so this is why we're drawn to
something like the beginning of infinity
and the work of David Deutsch generally
because he has devoted his life to
drilling down to find the most
foundational principles across physics
epistemology mathematics and so once you
get down there to that level of depth
you really are talking about all the
ways in which knowledge is created in
every other subject and the limitations
that
the physics actually places upon our
ability as human beings to construct
knowledge so once you've got those
fundamental ideas you've got a really
interesting way of critiquing all the
other ideas that are out there and so
that's why we're so uh thrilled with the
beginning of infinity because it's one
of the most profound books with respect
to depth of ideas yeah
I don't want to keep plugging Boi
forever but I would also say that I just
think physicists are among the smartest
people in the world there was a study
that came out recently where they were
showing like average IQ of students who
had finished their PHD across different
disciplines and it says something like
archeology was in the 140s and
psychology was in the high 140s and so
on and so on it when the highest was
physics I think it was like 162 or 160
something and I actually took Umbridge
with that I was like no there's not that
small of a gap between psychologists and
physicists because a lot of modern
psychology to me are almost borders on
charlatanism just look at look up the
replication crisis if you want to see an
example of what I mean so I didn't trust
those numbers off the bat so I looked at
the underlying paper and the underlying
paper was really interesting the
methodology that the author used was she
basically gave them all tests in various
disciplines and subjects but trying to
be broad like the sat right so she gave
them verbal and she gave them math and
critical thinking and all that and what
happened was the physicist
aced the math tests almost to a t all of
them nailed it completely because any
test that is challenging for a
psychologist is essentially trivial for
a physicist or any test that we could
measure the difference between two
physicists would be impossible for any
psychiatrist or psychologists so she
dropped the math results for the
physicists she didn't take it into
account when calculating their scores so
basically they crushed the entire field
just on verbal and basic logic reasoning
and the math was so off the charts he
couldn't even include it in the results
so that that to me was very telling and
I think the reason why physicists are so
intelligent is it's not that being a
physicist makes you intelligent it's
just the bar to being a good physicist
is very high intelligence because you're
dealing with the reality in its ultimate
form you're dealing with absolute truth
and so it's up to you to rise to the
occasion and to develop such a rigorous
way of reasoning thinking and
calculating and all the skills that go
with it including the advanced
mathematics that you can communicate
with the reality in its own terms you're
not communicating with other humans who
limit you to to human levels and will
give you a pass for example if I'm
trying to be a macro Economist pretty
much get everything wrong you'll never
find a macro Economist who can
consistently predict the direction of
the macroeconomy nor can you run a
counterfactual test so macroeconomist
and macroeconomics even though there's a
lot of good rules of thumb and some
explanations in the field in practice it
ends up being about pleasing and
convincing other people so your feedback
loop just isn't as tight I would argue
that someone who's trading
cryptocurrencies or stocks actually has
a tighter feedback loop because at least
they're taking feedback from a market
rather than say from a publication or
small group of individuals so in that
sense they're closer to the truth closer
to truth seeking or feedback from what
is true but physicists have the ultimate
feedback on what is true because a
particle is not going to listen to a
physicist because they have a PhD or a
high rank and so they're forced to
correspond to reality and obviously the
physical chemistry and other Sciences
the hard science is the Natural Sciences
all have the same type feedback loophole
that's probably tightest in physics and
Mathematics yeah I guess physics isn't
unique in the fact that it Bridges both
the abstract and the highly practical
and well it's called physics so it's
about the physical but it has
characteristics of engineering which is
of course concerned with what is
practically actually the case not so
much what's theoretically the case but
pure mathematics on the other hand is
interested in what might possibly be the
case and need not practically ever
obtain in the real world and yet physics
Bridges both of these domains and so we
can enter into the kind of theoretical
dream world about what could possibly be
the case but we're also constrained by
what physical reality is telling us as
well and so I think this is why a lot of
people are attracted to physics anyway
it has aspects of both if you like pure
mathematics then you can get a little
bit of that and if you like engineering
and solving practical problems you can
get a little bit of that and so physics
occupies that real sweet space yeah it's
not the only one I would guess
theoretical computer scientists are
probably at the same level but the
problem is if you're a physicist you're
basically all into Theory or academic
and you're dealing with the highest
levels of abstractions whereas if you're
a computer scientist you may just go
into very practical things and end up
being an entrepreneur so the set of
practicing computer science is probably
far greater than the set of theoretical
physicists and so just the barrier to
entry in the computer science field is
lower but probably at the very top
levels computer scientists the top
physical chemists maybe the top
molecular biologists top material
scientists top Engineers are at the same
level of intellect as a top physicists
again it's not to say that being one of
these professions makes you smart it's
just the bar to getting into one of
these professions at the top levels
indicates that you are very smart
doesn't mean you're smart and everything
if you go back to my definition of
getting what you want in a life then
many of them would fail in that regard
but I'm talking about a certain kind of
theoretical smart about abstractions
logic clear thinking reasoning
mathematical capabilities Etc and we can
in split hairs on what the definition of
intelligence is but then we're falling
to this wittkinsonian trap of what is
the meaning of meaning anyway and then
you can't have any conversations
everyone is equal in a infinite
ignorance we might have our own areas a
specialty that we know about but we're
infinitely ignorant of a whole bunch of
things so you can name the physicist and
you can name their crazy idea you know
of course we all respect Albert Einstein
but I only learned recently and I
probably shouldn't have learned this
recently but he was a real supporter of
One World Government now I could not
think of a more dystopian view of the
way in which a society could be
organized than having a One World
Government but I guess he was speaking
at a time when the crisis that he was
facing at that time was different to
what we're facing now yeah I think that
the One World Government folks
especially in the physics domain they
came from a background where you had
World War II going on and they had
helped in the creation of nuclear
weapons and so to them uh mad mutually
assured destructions didn't exist yet
and Matt has been surprisingly effective
in practice to date and I don't think
any of the physicists involved predicted
that it would be that good so they
thought that they might have destroyed
the world and the only way they could
think out of that was that there was one
government that government would not
want to use nuclear weapons against
themselves so I think that was the
underlying motivator for that reasoning
although I don't think they were
articulated as such let me see if I can
pull somebody else up so it's not just
me and Brett talking the whole night I'm
just looking through people's bios but
in the meantime if you got anything to
say oh I just wanted to Riff Off what
you you began with I was actually here
at the beginning listening to uh you're
talking about life as a single player
game and it really evoked for me what
Carl poppas is about how all life is
problem solving and so what we're trying
to do constantly is to solve our
problems and the more knowledge that you
have the greater the repertoire of
different problems that you are able to
solve and we want to solve things like
suffering and we want to be able to
improve our lot in life and so this idea
of it being a single player game I think
really gets at the heart of that idea
that you're just constantly trying to
avoid the next thing that is going to
thwart you in finding happiness and
making progress in generating wealth
yeah and I think that it's interesting
David Deutsch has pointed this out that
people who Converge on the truth
converge together and it's interesting
how you were coming to these ideas
before you encountered Deutsche before
you encountered copper but when you
found them that it began to resonate
with exactly what you'd been saying and
what you've been promoting out there
yeah the set of truths is depending on
what truth we're talking about but the
set of truths is quite large but it's
still infinitesimal compared to the set
of potential falsehoods we can create a
lot more falsehoods that we can create
Truth for sure and that's why one of the
things you have to do is that there's a
whole class of conjectures and problems
people will say to you prove to me that
this is false you should consider my
theory but most theories can be without
deep examination okay so here's a recent
one that's getting me uh burned a lot so
I'll go right into it which is somebody
who I thought was very intelligent
otherwise intelligent approached me on
the aliens visiting the Earth theory
that these UFOs are flying around and
they can kind of hide in for us and I I
have a lot of good arguments against it
there are many ranging from the fact
that the photographic evidence seems to
be still grainy and sketchy to why would
they even do it in the first place to
what are the odds given the distances
involved to to it's more easily
explained by just being a military
program that's clandestine even from the
kind of people in the military who are
not giving access the same level of
classification to the fact that
eyewitness accounts are incredibly
unreliable Etc okay just go on and on
but at the end of the day I had to
respond with just one phrase It's just
extraordinary claims require
extraordinary evidence and the evidence
that you're provided for the
extraordinary claim just isn't good
enough for it to be a theory that we're
going to go through and consider so
actually maybe you can talk a little bit
about UFO sighting spread while I hunt
down somebody else to pull up here I
think it was Elon Musk that he shared
that graph that shows the number of
cameras that are out there now on
smartphones and everything have gone up
exponentially but the quality of
pictures of UFOs apparent UFO sightings
has not gone up extend eventually it
remained basically the same ever since
sort of the 60s kind of thing it's
always grainy like you said yeah I don't
think that we've been visited I'd like
to know that we were but specifically
for the reason that either the aliens
are doing a particularly good job of
remaining hidden or a particularly bad
job of remaining hidden depending upon
how you look at things after all they
appear to keep on being spotted by
people who live in the uh southern
states of the United States more often
than not one of my arguments about this
is that it seems to be the case that
biology isn't necessarily friendly
towards getting the project of life
started here on Earth it appears to have
happened once life began once and we
don't know the mechanism whereby that
life is actually able to arise again
it's not like we can create artificial
life in the lab at least we haven't
figured it out yeah there's lightning in
the Bible experiments have been grossly
exaggerated I think when I was going
drink with a kid we're like yeah we just
put a whole bunch of inorganic compounds
to a bottle and we throw some
electricity in there and poof we get
life and it's just not true but we do
have this interesting Challenge on the
one hand yeah that those are the the
Miller Yuri experiments and they're
still going on today and they're trying
to put ammonia and amino acids and
various things into this flask and add
electricity add UV lights see what comes
out and they haven't managed to have
anything crawl out of the flask so to
speak they haven't created simple cells
even they haven't created anything that
appears to be anywhere close to what
life is so on the one hand it seems life
is difficult to make but on the other
hand the geological evidence says that
after the so-called late heavy
bombardment this is the period in
geological history where the Earth was
just being inundated by comets and
asteroids and being sterilized by global
kind of cratering from all of these
bodies in the solar system that was
crashing into the Earth and so therefore
the Earth was entirely unfriendly to any
kind of biology that could have Arisen
but as soon as that ended as soon as it
stopped being unfriendly to life life
appeared on Earth and so that would
suggest life does arise as quickly as it
possibly can so do we say life is easy
to produce or do we say it's hard to
produce at the moment we're in this
really interesting place where progress
is possible hey here's a problem so if
there's any young person out there
interested in the physics of the origin
of life this is a real important open
question
I've added a couple people for questions
you're up next if you've got a moment
sure thanks for having me Naval good to
see you again my question is around
prioritization and guarding one's time I
see you at someone who is good at saying
no so I wanted to know do you have a
mental framework that helps you decide
what is worth your time and what is not
and saying no to those things without
feeling guilty thank you
great question yes I put a lot of effort
into this uh so I'm going to move you
back to the audience that promised yeah
things to Aspire to move past in your
life first you want to get out of your
parents basement then you're living with
roommates then you want to get away from
roommates then you're driving commute to
work then you want to get up a commute
then you're waking up to an alarm clock
then you want to get away from an alarm
clock then you're basically living a
highly calendared and scheduled life you
want to get away from your calendar then
finally you want to get over here from
email and text messages so I'm sort of
working my way through this rabbit hole
and where I currently am is I've gotten
rid of calendars and schedules and I'm
trying to get rid of emails all together
I now check my email once every three
days and I eventually want to get to the
point where I never check my email and
obviously this is a luxury but you can
get there you just have to engineer your
life towards it and you have to be
uncompromising you have to reject social
obligations you have to reject meetings
that are a waste of time you have to be
okay with saying no you have to give up
your fomo you have have to not be afraid
to disappoint people and cut people out
of your life who aren't comfortable with
spontaneity and lack of schedules the
email one's going to be a little harder
but yeah there are sacrifices involved
along every step of the way nothing is
cost free but what do you get on the
other side you get your time back and if
you have your time then you have
spontaneity which I would argue helps
with the flourishing of joy in your life
you have creativity because you now have
time to get bored in time to think you
have proper prioritization where now
you're going to focus on what's the most
important thing as opposed to just what
happens to be scheduled you're going to
have productivity because you're going
to work on things when you feel like
them as opposed to when you are forced
to grind through something when you
don't feel like it and you're going to
say but wait of all I can't do this I
have a job and my answer is well change
jobs get a job where you're in control
of your own time or you'll say my extra
time is worthless I can't earn more if
I'm working harder or working different
hours then I'll say change your career
to where you can or you'll say but my
family won't tolerate it and I'm like
retrain in your family change your
friends change your co-workers
disappoint people if you're not
disappointing them if you're not leaving
people behind you're not really changing
changing is also growing growth involves
change so if you want to operate at
maximum productivity efficiency and
creativity you're going to work on
things that you're excited about at the
moment you're excited about them and
accept nothing less it is better to sit
on your butt and do nothing that is to
work on things that you are not excited
about because now you're just grinding
and you're robbing yourself of the time
that you need to have the good thoughts
the proper space to find what it is that
you're meant to work on and where you're
meant to live and and who you're meant
to be with I have been utterly ruthless
about prioritizing my time and saying no
to things and I I disappoint people
every single day on it every single day
and I will continue to do so until I
have complete control of my time back
Daniel you're up next yeah thanks for
letting me come up so I live and work in
the developing world and sucked into the
web 3 rabbit hole because I saw the
potential for like this new potential
for the developing world to access uh
Global markets in a whole new way and so
I'm just wondering two things number one
what you think about web 3 and the
potential for the developing world and
then also second the question of scale
what do you think it will take to scale
web 3 to lifting up those communities
that have by and large been left behind
thanks
yeah I'm not an expert on developing
World challenges I would just say that
the decentralizing permissionless nature
of crypto means that we can build
financial instruments and governance
instruments that can be adopted
regardless of the dysfunction of the
local government right a lot of the
developing world the problem is
dysfunctional local government not
always but it happens a lot and crypto
is self-governing you have tokens you
can vote you have Dows you have
distribution of power and according to
proven judgment and contribution to the
network so as long as you're dealing
with an all-digital problem like
transferring money or trading stocks or
investing in companies or issuing loans
or repaying loans and those kinds of
things then very naturally and very
easily you can adopt crypto in a way
that the people can opt into what
instrument to take and not have the
government involved I do think it's a
little early in the sense that the first
app that I would expect to be adopted in
all of crypto not just in the developing
world is Bitcoin as a reserve asset so
for example you see what's happening in
Russia and Ukraine if you're a wealthy
person who is in Russia right now or
even a poor person who's in Russia right
now and you're queued up at the ATM and
you're told you can't get hard currency
out you can get rubles but you can't get
dollars and all your USD deposits in
your bank account even if you were lucky
enough to foreign Bank deposits are
being forcibly converted into rubles and
anybody who has earning power
internationally is currently trying to
flee Russia because they're afraid of
the sanctions at regime and just the
impoverishment of Russia as slides back
into becoming an autarkic economy where
everything is locally produced and
locally consumed but which is really bad
for things like semiconductors and
information technology and medicine and
so on so I think that there are a lot of
people who are in Russia who they don't
understand Bitcoin but boy would they
wish that they had Bitcoin right now so
I think in the developing World
similarly there's a lot of kleptocracies
where the local government just prints
money and steals money from the people I
think 100 years from now people will
look back and will be considered
laughably archaic that we used to pass
around pieces of paper that somebody had
something literally called a money
printing press or that they could print
as much more of as they wanted in the
background and so by doing that they
they impoverished all of society in a
hidden way and so I would expect in the
developing world as you have more and
more economic and social collapses
because of these kleptocratic printing
presses that Bitcoin will eventually get
adopted it started to happen in El
Salvador where they declared it legal
tender I'm hearing about a few other
places I think the new South Korean
president is very pro-crypto and as we
see more and more people adopting
Bitcoin across from corporate treasuries
to these developing country situations I
think could be a killer app that said
the fact that we have not yet seen Mass
Bitcoin adoption in developing countries
is a bit of a yellow or red flag for the
industry it means that it's still super
hard to use use people don't understand
the concept and they still haven't
figured out the advantages I do feel
like a couple of several Global crises
have already come and gone where Bitcoin
would have been a great answer to them
but we still did not see Mass adoption
of Bitcoin and make no mistake like
Bitcoin isn't perfect it does suffer
from certain issues obtaining it is
still quite hard to do so you have to
buy it through a centralized exchange
and then your track is transparent
rather than being opaque although if it
was opaque like Z cash would probably be
banned in a lot of countries as well if
they really understood the capabilities
but I think in the developing world just
basically protecting the assets that you
have already accumulated and created
there are a huge good use of crypto web
3 is a little more fanciful now we do
see in the Philippines for example
people are playing games for money
actually infinity and the people like
yield games have built Guilds of players
and people can make a living playing
these games I don't really view that as
a best use of web3 it's a fine
intermediate use case and it's how
helping people in developing world gets
digital salaries that are on a par with
First World countries or developed
Nations but that strikes me as like an
intermediate step it's not really making
the underlying people better off it's
not training into computer scientists
it's not helping them start new
companies it's not protecting their
assets rather it's just giving them a
new job but it's fine as an intermediate
stepping stone but it's not really the
web 3 Revolution we were promised I'm
afraid the web 3 revolution in the
developing world is still going to be
largely limited to bitcoin or Z cash or
Monero for private transactions and I
think it's still on the horizon and it's
gotten closer but it's still not quite
there yet let's find someone else who's
uh speaking Brett I think you did an
episode on your podcast on bitcoin
didn't you yeah I tried to take a
different attack and I was talking about
ethereum ethereum as being a a potential
Universal computer of a kind and you
know they're far better than I do but
it's really interesting to me that here
we have a another case of universality
whenever human beings create another
instance of universality another case
where we can literally do everything
within a certain class of projects that
is possible you know this first happened
with a classical computer actually it
happened with language of course then it
happened with the classical computer
quantum computer and I think ethereum
and other kinds of blockchain like that
are going to allow computation a
universal style of computation which is
absolutely going to change the face of
society in the same way that classical
Computing did
Emmett I think you're up next if you
want to go yes thanks thanks for taking
my question first of all thanks for
doing this and I love your uh the music
that meeting wave puts up of some of
your riffs on some of your interviews if
anyone else oh yeah that's uh yeah yeah
he's great a DJ yeah anyone who hasn't
heard of him check it out Spotify medium
wave but anyway question for you is is
there anything in particular you think
like in the last few years that you've
thought that you've been wrong about we
all there's so much for us to know we
can't we only know so a little of the
universe or whatever it is and the human
nature physics even but is there
anything in particular personally that
you feel like you strongly believed in
but you changed your mind completely on
the last few years yeah good question
there's plenty of things I've been wrong
about I don't fixate on them I take the
lesson and move on I basically dropped
out of paying attention to crypto in
2018 2019 and even part of 2020 because
I was put off by the whole Ico craze and
all the you know terrible get rich quick
schemes that were being launched and
scamming people so I kept you know know
talking about Bitcoin and Ethan a few
others but I sort of lost interest in
the space and I completely missed defy I
also completely missed nfts they were
right under my nose I had friends
talking about them participating in them
literally I was on a weekly call with a
guy who turned out to be one of the
biggest collectors on the planet he
would tell me every week about how he's
buying this digital art and I just
rolled my eyes and didn't get so I
completely missed that going way back
like I'm an old school military history
buff so I grew up as a kid I could have
told you the throw weights of different
nuclear missiles and if I had giant
books about military fighters on my
bookshelf so anytime a war comes on I
get obsessed and I just dive into it I
tweeted out a war of this recently don't
ask me why is child driven testosterone
thing from playing with too many
military airplane airplanes and tanks
and I used to play a lot of War games
and you know there was a time when I I
bought the whole Bush era Saddam has wmd
I fell for that line hook and sinker so
I was wrong about that I was wrong about
covid very early on very early on when
people were dropping dead in the streets
and the videos coming out of China I
know I thought wow maybe this thing has
a very high CFR confirmed fatality rate
but I turned around that pretty quickly
and I came to the conclusion that no
it's like a novel 10x flu which is still
really bad for older people but my
mental model then shifted to it impacts
you as sort of the the square of your
age so the older you are the much worse
time you're gonna have so I think that
was wrong in my initial assessments
about covid but I stand by some of my
later assessments or my current more
refined assessments I I would say my
whole theory of knowledge was pretty
shaky and quite bad before I discovered
Deutsche and Popper's work so I was
infinitely wrong in many of those cases
I never bought a string theory but I
wasn't a fan of Multiverse Theory until
I read some of the more compelling
arguments from Deutsch and Sean Carroll
look most of us are wrong most of the
time but you don't need to be right a
lot in this world especially in the
digital domain in the physical domain
being wrong can have very large
consequences but in the digital domain
being wrong can have not much
consequences you may lose the money you
bad or you wrote a piece of code that
was useless but being correct can have
huge consequences positive you can make
asymmetric upside you can make a 100x or
a thousand extra money on Tesla stock or
on buying ethereum at the right time or
you can reach a million people with the
right tweet or the right message or the
right podcast perfectly crafted while
being wrong it doesn't cost you much in
certain domains it makes sense to bet
much bigger these days I just try to
have less opinions about things I feel
like I don't need to have an opinion on
everything and that's not for being
right or wrong it's just to have mental
Clarity and to have peace of mind you
don't need to have an opinion every
person walking down the street or
everything you see in the news or even
about every form of government there is
an infinite set of things out there that
are demanding your attention and trying
to hijack your attention I I this is a
little tongue-in-cheek but the goal of
media at some level is to make every
problem in your problem and social media
does this in Spades it offers you up a
new tweet or a new post and says are you
angry yet no are you angry yet no are
you annoyed yet no are you angry yet it
just keeps going through all these
different sets of them and tries all
different kinds to find something to get
you hooked so the way out of that trap
is you almost have to realize the mental
load that happens on you when one of
these Loops gets stuck in your head it's
like when you listen to a song in the
background and you don't necessarily
love the song but you just listen to it
a couple of times and now it's looping
in your head well the news can do the
same thing anger can do the same thing
and I think to some level a lot of the
anxiety that we suffer from is because
we've taken on unconsciously all these
problems and then other people are
coming in and trying to get you to solve
their problem that they believe is the
greatest problem in the world so
somebody will come along and say the
greatest problem is that we're killing
all the animals and so you got to go
vegan somebody else will say that's
climate change and you shouldn't worry
about anything else to worry about that
for many people realistically that's
what's going on in Ukraine for some
people it might be what's going on in
politics but everybody has a different
set of problems and you really have to
learn to not take on other people's
problems this is not to say that you
take on absolutely no problems but first
make sure that you are doing a good job
of solving your own direct problems and
that you have a clear mind before you
then selectively choose other problems
to take on which you can actually have
an impact on don't just take on problems
that you can't solve
if I could just add a little bit to that
I think that if we Define a contrarian
as someone who simply takes the opposite
position to whatever the prevailing view
is I don't know that there's a lot of
use to doing that but if you can
identify the places where the
overwhelming majority of people on
planet Earth are holding a particular
opinion that actually is false and you
have some insight into that then that is
a place for you to make progress and to
make a difference in the world my
favorite example of this is that
everyone seems to know that resources on
planet Earth are finite everyone seems
to agree and so therefore we've got to
conserve our resources our natural
resources but this is completely false
that there's a YouTube video that I did
about this about the fact that a
resource is only a resource once we have
the knowledge about why and how it is
and a simple example is uranium uranium
exists in the rock called pitch blend
which is an otherwise useless rock until
you have nuclear physics and this is
true of every single resource and the
thing that makes a resource a resource
is knowledge which we can continue
indefinitely to produce more of and if
we can continue to do that which we will
then we won't run out of resources
because we'll find new resources in the
future and this is not simply to be
contrarian and a lot of people balk at
this and people get very upset when I
say this but it simply is the case that
we're not going to run out of resources
resources are infinite because our
creativity is infinite and so we can
solve the problem that for any finite
particular resource any individual
resource that might run out we'll find
something to replace it and so we don't
need to be pessimistic about the future
about running out of resources about how
we're coming to rack and ruin and that
we're going to end up existing in
poverty in fact it's quite the opposite
we're going to be more wealthy we're
going to be more more happy we're going
to have more resources and so if you're
going to take the opposite perspective
to what the prevailing view is if you
can find those examples like that
particular one that's just a random an
example you can actually take the
position that is held by only a very
tiny minority of people that's an Avenue
for you to certainly either make a
difference in some way philosophically
or perhaps to generate wealth in a way
that other people or pessimists who
don't think it's possible won't bother
trying but you'll try because you'll
have a different perspective yeah as
they've said don't debate them in the
media when you can debate them in the
marketplace but if truth is on your side
by all means feel free to bet them in
the media too I do think Brett's
sustainability episode is one of his
best it's a mind Bender it will
challenge many deeply held assumptions
it's worth reviewing I remember the peak
oil debacle when everybody was saying
we're going to run out of oil and then
it turns out no shell and fracking came
along and we actually have unlimited oil
we just choose not to use it for other
reasons now but there's no shortage of
oil on this planet at least for the
foreseeable future essentially it all
boils into knowledge it all boils down
to how much do we know and the more we
know the more we can do with what we
have all the resources that we need are
available to us on this Earth in the
solar system in the asteroid belt in the
sun in this galaxy even in empty space
so-called empty space there's a lot of
resources it's just a question of how
can we create a powerful enough or
discover and utilize a powerful enough
energy source to extract whatever
resources we need and understand the
processes required to convert one thing
to another Deutsche has a great
definition of wealth I Define wealth
that more practically as assets that
earn while you sleep but he defined it
as a civilizational level as the set of
physical Transformations that you can
affect and I think that's a very
powerful one because it shows we're only
limited by our knowledge it's not to say
you can't run out of things in the short
term but economic incentives are set up
in such a way that as long as there
isn't a lot of government interference
that creativity can help you out of that
trap now it does have to proceed its
natural level there are not that many
shortcuts in life but I think we can
find our way out of these so-called
sustainability trap which is really just
a deeply pessimistic the world is ending
Cassandra approach that people like to
take on a regular basis because
pessimism is intellectually seductive a
lot of intellectuals tend to be
pessimistic which is not to say that
being pessimistic makes you smart but
people confuse that so they signal their
intelligence by pessimism whereas I
would argue that pessimism is actually
the opposite signal the cynicism that
goes with it it shows a lack of
imagination it shows a lack of reading
history it shows the lack of actually
looking at the Arc of human progress and
if you fall into the Trap of being a
pessimistic or a cynic or invicted
mentality I would say pessimism
and cynicism is a societal level version
of victim mentality it's even worse than
victim entire victim mentality just
keeps you down pessimism and cynicism
especially when articulated by very
eloquent people keep Society down and
that's not so good very briefly uh
pessimism is leaked very strongly to
prophecy as well there are two ways of
talking about the future either we can
predict the future or we can prophesy
the future the only way to predict the
future is to have a robust scientific
explanation and that scientific
explanation allows you to logically
derive certain claims about the future
so in physics we do this routinely we
can predict when the ball is going to
hit the ground trivially
but as soon as we get outside of the
physical sciences once we start getting
into economics once we start getting
into sociology and Global Affairs and
even something like the global climate
it becomes far more difficult to make
those guesses about the future and so
they cease to be predictions they cease
to be based upon good scientific
explanations and they become prophecies
and it doesn't matter how many letters
you've got after your name it doesn't
matter that you've got a PhD in
meteorology if you're claiming to know
what things are going to be like a
thousand years from now or a hundred
years from now 10 years from now you're
being a prophet you're being the same
crystal ball Gaza as people in the past
have been yeah one of the things that
annoys me about the whole current
standard line attack where people say
you can't talk about that stay in your
lane what they mean is you don't have
the expertise and if you do one level
further what they mean is that you don't
have the credentials and if you dig one
level further what that means is you
don't have the right academic stamp and
so all that's doing is reducing Society
to a small set of academic credentials
people who are in a circle jerk issuing
each other credentials and they're not
going to think out of the box and
they're certainly not going to think
anything that goes against their
profession so I would trust a physicist
on climate science much more than I
would trust the climate scientist I
would trust a computer scientist on AI
much more than I would trust an AI
researcher just because once you adopted
a point of view as your identity you're
unlikely to say anything that might
contradict in that sense I don't like to
put any labels on myself nor do I think
that we should be worshiping at the
altar of credentials a lot of the great
advances in human history came through
polymaths came through mixing
disciplines Nature has no concept of
disciplines Nature has no concept of
different professions that's just a
human-made construct sure if you're
going to get operated upon you probably
want someone with a medical degree
because there you're trying to minimize
the chance of something going wrong and
the better the entry is very high but
when it comes to for example figuring
out even deep Trends in things like
epistemology and evolution some of the
best work has been done by people
outside of the field and certainly in
everyday Affairs like what is the right
role of government what is the right
spending level what is the right
taxation level should we wear masks or
not which is a multivariate decision
should we force people to get vaccinated
or not which is more than just a pure
biological decision it also impinges on
human freedom and human rights I think
everybody who has done a little bit of
homework as a clear thinker is entitled
to have an opinion and so the stay in
your lane attack is one that
automatically leads to a block from me
because those people are essentially
just advocating for University academics
to run the world flywheel I will let you
talk awesome it's incredibly difficult
trying a time when I was going to enter
and come up with a quick whip but one I
wanted to say from earlier when you were
mentioning physics and whatnot I had
lost a bet that you would mention uh
Feynman and so I thought that was quite
funny to share and I went so close to
Mission I knew it I was gonna bring up
the nature always we use threads out of
the longest tapestries and so there's
only a few theories you need to
understand I was going to follow that on
to right about in deep explanations
being better than broad explanations So
yeah thank you very much Simplicity yes
exactly yeah so that was one quick whip
then the next one that I had was when
you guys were a moments ago discussing
when you were mentioning pessimism and I
was going to say pessimism is Media
needs to generate money in some Manner
and if you want to have a one-sided
opinion the easiest way to validate
people's emotion is to create the issue
at hand and when you create the issue
and you create the narrative and then
you empower hour someone's thinking
letting them know that it's correct
because it's a part of the masses now
you've compounded the initial idea which
is the news that you're giving to them
which is something that was not
something they were concerned of prior
to tuning in and it has these
compounding effects which ultimately
gives control of your entire mental
capacity and people don't necessarily
have you know time to to think for
themselves that's a great point it
reminds me of this uh loose idea that I
have which is probably wrong because I
haven't really thought it through but
that's a lot of modern society the media
rails against but I don't think weed is
as bad as fear because what's the worst
case with greed the worst case with
greed is you go off and do something for
your greed but especially in a
capitalist environment you're almost by
definition have to create a product or
sell something and it's probably a
voluntary transaction the way we're
designed is yes we get greedy but we
only agreed to waste certain level
because in evolution the rewards to
being greedy were fairly low before
human wealth existed if you were greedy
you might get an extra deer carcass you
might get an extra meal you might find a
better place to sleep fear on the other
hand had huge consequences which was if
you were not afraid when the tiger
showed up if you didn't realize when the
scream went out you were gonna get eaten
or when the neighboring tribe attacked
you were going to get skinned so the
consequences to fear have historically
been much greater the rewards to Greed
which is partially why I think we're a
fearful and pessimistic species now why
do I bring that up I say that because I
think that the people who control you
through greed actually have a lot less
power than the people who control you
through fear and that is why a lot of
media is about fear so if you're getting
angry at people being greedy I would be
much more careful about the people who
are inducing fear in you because it
always starts out as hey I'm giving you
a public service you should pay
attention and so you look at them as a
good guys they get the virtue signal and
then they they drive you into a fearful
State fear naturally leads to anger
because now you're angry that you're
driven into a corner you're afraid and
that leads to conflict so I think a lot
of the modern conflicts that are
otherwise avoidable are driven through
fear so always be very wary of people
who are trying to scare you usually
they're up to no good they may be
genuine and authentic and think they're
trying to do your public service but I
think that as a society we push back and
greedy people too much and we don't push
back enough on the people who are
inciting fear
I would go so far as to say that and
just to elaborate on that thought in
this I have I do have a question but
telebrand on that thought is I think the
they are fearful there's especially with
the new technologies that come about
there's no other way to try and quiet
someone who's saying even the smallest
idea that gets planted into someone's
brain to begin a sprout they wanted to
cut that off at its at its root because
sorry before if there was any water that
would even you know water that seed and
the reason being is they are incredibly
fearful because the technologies that
have come about from nowhere early in
you know the 90s and the.com bubble
where you had this significant new
Underdog where you had so much wealth
creation that was traditionally rooted
in oil gas and real estate and other
types of traditional means that now can
be combated with this new opportunity to
create something to fight back with
which which is this wealth from uh
monetizing and all of our information in
that I think there's been this decade or
two decade struggle for power where
you've had people knowing that we can't
respect people and give them the
opportunities to think for themselves
and and we can treat them though with
pity I think a lot of our issues in
Society come from the lack of belief in
somebody else's ability in order to
enable a person to feel more competent
for themselves put them down and not
even give them an opportunity to think
for themselves where if you were to
start to replace that with empathy you
would have a different view on people
and give them capabilities but they're
grasping for power I'm going to have to
thank you for those thoughts I want to
balance you for a moment just to make
room for others because we're running
out of time it's already an hour and a
half in and people are probably getting
pretty tired by the way I would also say
people should feel free to ask questions
about a topic where I actually do have
some expertise which is making money and
wealth creation because studied that
pretty heavily or not studied learned
that where I do consider myself an
actual expert and not just on philosophy
or physics or politics or where I'm more
of an amateur not that I need not that
I'm going to stay in my Lane but just
feel free to ask questions about your
business or business problems you're
having
all right let's try to give me
hey so great talk so far one question I
have and something I've seen a lot
happen recently is the fervor and the
excitement over web3 and This Promise of
a great new future has a lot of people
obviously getting into the space running
in Full Tilt ahead but I think a thing
that a lot of people misunderstand is
that you can't simply move into a new
economy a digital wonderful digital one
and just a shoe the old one which is I
think the pipe dream of a lot of new
companies now so the question I have is
how exactly does this aside sort of
fundamentally rewrite the rules and pay
the piper so to speak so that the Old
Guard doesn't just spend every last bit
of energy they have attempting to
dismantle the new because it threatens
sort of the safety and the security that
they're hoping to get with the systems
that they've built and brought up to
speed for today
yeah so how do we prevent the olds from
stopping web3 actually Douglas Adams the
late great Douglas Adams author of The
Hitchhiker's got the Galaxy said this
brilliantly I'm paraphrasing him but he
said something along the lines of
everything that happened before I was 20
it was like natural and normal and just
the way the world is and everything that
happens between the ages of 20 and 30 is
new and exciting and fresh and something
that I can build my worldview and my
career upon and everything that happens
after I'm 40 is suspicious and terrible
and not to be trusted it must be
suppressed and stuff and it is true it
is the way the human mind works when
you're young you're impressionable
you're absorbing you take the world as
it's given to you you're adapting to the
world that you're going to live in then
you go through this phase where you're
looking for opportunity you're looking
for Frontiers you have excitement you
want to build something you want to
create something you want to change the
world you want to get your message out
there and so you tend to naturally
hopefully view things as opportunities
and then at some point you just get
tired you have a family of kids you're
getting a little older you want things
to be calm you want them to be simple
you don't want to expend too much energy
and you want stability and so you tend
to look with a negative eye with a
jaundiced eye towards anything new
coming up and so that's just human
nature how do we stop it look we don't
necessarily stop it not all change is
good I think Brett has talked about this
but change that destroys embedded
institutional knowledge too quickly it's
bad there's this whole crowd now that
says capitalism doesn't work we do it
with capitalism and you ask them what
we're going to replace it with you get
crickets because we know that communism
doesn't work and we know that socialism
is as communism light it slides towards
communism and maybe it works in some
very small societies like Sweden Denmark
where they're you know homogeneous race
and they're protected by the United
States and they're hidden behind
mountains and they have huge natural
resources but even there I would argue
that it's not exactly the hotbed of
innovation creativity but regardless so
people hate capitalism but they have
nothing else to replace it with so not
all change is necessarily good but
something like web3 heck yeah you bet
they're going to try and stop it you bet
they're going to try and Outlaw you bet
they're going to crack down on it if it
didn't then it wouldn't actually be that
valuable it's not actually that
disruptive I do think that countries
that try to ban or stop or slow down web
3 are going to find themselves
increasingly on the wrong side of
History even today for example a lot of
the new crypto token offerings are only
available to non-americans which is kind
of sad you're cut out as an American a
lot of the new products are being forced
overseas all the crypto teams that are
settling with the SEC or cftc often end
up relocating their products overseas or
their operations team overseas or only
serving overseas customers this is
literally driving Innovation out and it
comes from this mythology that the
United States somehow creates
entrepreneurs that's not true the United
States attracts entrepreneurs and
attracts entrepreneurs because they're
from the environment for entrepreneurs
or used to be anyway and now those
entrepreneurs are going to be attracted
elsewhere and the internet or at least
the part of the internet that's high
quality and works and it's Innovative is
global we're lucky that Bitcoin was
probably created by an American a group
of Americans are spread in the U.S first
but if the next Bitcoin or the next eth
is created in some other part of the
world we're going to watch those other
countries become rich and by the time we
figure out that they're at the Forefront
of knowledge creation it will be too
late there's nothing that guarantees
that the United States will stay at the
Forefront of human history what's taken
it so far has been the unprecedented
freedoms that it offered in the Bill of
Rights but those freedoms are being
increasingly circumscribed and limited
by sort of this bureaucratic State
that's taken over of Administrators and
courtiers who are essentially
controlling what is allowed what isn't
people like the SEC the cftc and all
these three little agencies these are
just cops by another name who make rules
put people in jail take people to court
and even worse they don't necessarily
even try them they basically use their
influence with banks and lawyers and
scare tactics to clamp down Innovation
so I've always said going way back that
for crypto the final boss is the state
it's the governments of the world and
there will be a few of them who are
enlightened and who embrace the future
and usually those are strange and
uncommon combination of both enlightened
and desperate they're looking to gain
rather than to lose or look into the
future rather into the past and
unfortunately I think most of Western
societies now are sort of entering their
decadent Empire stage which can be a
great and fun place to hang out I'm sure
Roma the decline was a blast but it's
not necessarily the place where the
frontier thrives it's not the place
where Innovation happens one of the more
interesting things I've seen is there's
been an exodus from San Francisco during
the pandemic partially due to the
pandemic but partially due to their
horrible governance with just an awful
D.A who won't prosecute crime and a
board of education that doesn't believe
in education and so on and just a huge
homelessness problem that's just
multiplied and multiplied and basically
unparalleled single party rule which is
never a good idea whether it's left or
right but in this case it's harsh left
and as I've seen San Francisco crumble
eventually I think people will start
coming back the network effector is very
powerful and unfortunately this taste
but it's hard to argue with reality but
I have noticed that the crypto teams are
gone yes the majority of crypto
Innovation was outside of the San
Francisco Bay area but a large chunk of
the high quality companies were coming
out of the Bay Area and that range from
regulatory ones like coinbase to dexes
like dydx and even Solana and Phantom a
lot of these things were built and
operated out of the Bay Area but now I
think it's very clear that very few
crypto companies in their right mind are
going to start in the United States let
alone the San Francisco Bay Area I do
think the crypto Genies out of the
bottle web 3 Innovation is going more
and more Global certainly going you know
Cross City and that's not going to come
back and I don't think the action The
Regulators are going to be helpful I'm a
huge fan of divided government and
gridlock honestly because I view
government as being good at a few things
around public goods like National
Defense and Roads and that kind of stuff
but mostly what we spend money on is not
that and the huge number of laws that we
as soon as something becomes interesting
means that we restrict the frontier we
restrict the opportunities and we freeze
Innovation Peter Thiel famously asked
like where am I flying cars and Rockets
it's because the government got involved
why are the prices of Health Care and
real estate and education skyrocketing
while everything else is deflating once
the government got involved so generally
I think it should be left to the private
sector and obviously the government can
have some work in ensuring true
competition although they're pretty
incompetent there too but it would be
nice for example if they got Facebook
and Twitter to open up their apis or
something of this sort or be nice if
they broke Apple's App Store Monopoly
but I'm not counting on them to figure
out how to do that properly or at least
not until it's way too late in the wrong
way and so on I think the government
that governs best is the one that
governs slowly that makes very few
changes and tries not to fix things
because when it tries to fix something
it generally ends up breaking it look at
the TSA regime that we live under now
the transportation Safety Authority now
that the medical industrial complex
we're probably going to be wearing masks
and airplanes for a really long time air
travel just gets slower and slower
anyway this is not meant to be a polemic
against government but I like to buy the
government because then it gets out of
the way and it lets the private sector
innovate anyway probably too much said
on this topic but I think that web3 is I
wouldn't say design because it's not
designed by any single person but I
would say it is an emergent property of
the internet and it is the internet's
immune response to over regulation and
so it is designed to resist regulation
and the governments that try to over
regulate web 3 will find that it slips
away from them and it takes this massive
wealth creation and Innovation elsewhere
and the US is no longer the default
place where Innovation is going to
happen in web3 the default place for
Innovation and web 3 is the internet and
the internet is everywhere for the first
time in human history we have this thing
called a tradition of criticism which
perhaps is the defining characteristic
of the Enlightenment for the rest of
human history any tradition was to keep
things the same that's what a tradition
is you traditionally do the same thing
over and over again but uniquely our
society by which I'm in the United
States Canada Europe Australia we have
this tradition of criticism where over
time things change and it's sustainable
and it's stable and that's really unique
and I mention it now in the context of
what you've just been saying because
there are so many attacks on it now
there are so many attacks on the
traditions of criticism people involved
in cancer culture people saying that we
should censor this that or the other
people imposing regulations where they
don't need to be regulations these all
act to prevent criticism to prevent new
innovation and these are
anti-enlightenment ideas and we have to
guard against them and if you have a
chance to stand up again into something
then stand up against over regulation
stand up against any impingement on Free
Speech unfortunately for me as an
outsider a person who's not in the
United States the most disappointing
thing about the United States is how
anti-American so many Americans are
they're really against things like free
speech not all of them of course but
there is this unique feature of the
United States that we don't have
elsewhere Australia doesn't have free
speech some of us claim we do but we
don't we do not have a Bill of Rights in
the same way that America does so you
really need to value that and you need
to understand that you are in that
tradition of criticism you are following
on from the early Enlightenment thinkers
and of all the countries in the world
still the United States is preserving
the best parts of the Enlightenment
where unfortunately others in that
tradition aren't doing it as quite as
well
yeah the first amendment the Second
Amendment are quite unique in that
states and every now and then some
people will get triggered and I
mentioned and say well I'm really free
and then certain European country and
the answer is no you're not you can be
arrested for saying things that are
against the so-called law by the way
even the fire on a crowded theater thing
is bad law most people will tell you
that that was done in the context of
draft dodging in the war it was a bad
ruling and would probably not survive
today free speech in the United States
at least constitutionally is very
protected but because of the
monopolization of media by a small
number of social media companies who
themselves then engage in politicking
because they're protected by section 230
the communications decency act which
makes them not liable as Publishers even
though they censor and choose what
content goes in their platform they get
this weird protection from the
government that was meant to stop child
porn but then of course got abused and
used so that now the second rate failed
journalist joined trust and safety teams
for all these different platforms and
then they tell us what they think is
right and wrong so now all discourse and
creativity and and criticism is
relegated to what a second-rate failed
journalist on one of these platforms
thinks and of course they're just going
to listen to the academics you know
anyone with a PhD in their name which is
a BS credential passed on by another PhD
in circular reasoning so I'm not afraid
to call them out because I figured I'll
get canceled at some point anyway but I
just feel like the attacks on Free
Speech are the single most disgusting
feature of modern technology in modern
society and the fact that Twitter and
Facebook censor so often and so freely
if I could wish anyone out of existence
I would wish the trust and safety teams
and their jobs out of existence I think
censorship is no place in these
platforms we are absolutely capable of
taking care of ourselves if they just
let us publish And subscribe block lists
we could pick our own editors we could
mute and block our own accounts on an
individual basis and we can share them
with people that we trusted and this
whole idea that we need to be babysat is
just absurd and I think history will
look very unkindly upon these people
I think I should probably wrap it up
it's a
gone on for an hour 45. it's been good
catching up with everybody thanks for
tuning in hope it was useful I think I
recorded this if I didn't do this wrong
so people should be able to replay it
I'm sure somebody will put it on YouTube
If you are going to Tweet out of this
please be kind with the excerpts try and
replicate the context and remember if
you're going to straw man you will get
blocked so be kind thank you everybody
thank you Brett especially for showing
up and thank you fitting and take care
everybody an apology to Joseph who I
accidentally bounced at the beginning
when I was trying to figure out the
controls take care
