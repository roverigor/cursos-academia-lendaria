do you want to tell us about some of the
jobs that you had as a youth and the
specific job that kicked off your
fanatical obsession with creating wealth
this gets a little personal and I don't
want to do the humble brag thing there
was some thread going around Twitter
about like name five jobs you've held
and every rich person on there was
trying to signal how they were held like
normal job so I don't want to play that
game I've held a bunch of menial jobs
there are people who have had worse than
me people who had it better than me
there was one point where I was washing
dishes in the school cafeteria and I
said eff this I hate this I can't do
this anymore and I sweet-talk my way to
a computer science prof of helping ta
his CS class in algorithms when I myself
was completely unqualified for that and
so it forced me to learn computer
science algorithm so I could ta the rest
of the course but that desire came out
of the suffering of Washington dishes in
the college cafeteria which is not to
say there's anything wrong with that
there's nothing wrong with anything
really but it was just not for me I did
not enjoy it
I had an active mind and I wanted to
make my money and earn my living through
mental activities not through physical
activities but sometimes it takes the
suffering of doing the wrong thing to
motivate you enough to do the right
thing I worked at a law firm for a while
a big prestigious law firm in New York
City I had a big internship there and I
basically got fired for surfing using
that back in the day this is before the
internet was a big thing using that was
the news groups and it was the only way
for me to stay from being completely
bored and I was an overpaid guy wearing
a tie in a suit and had to hang out in
the conference room when the lawyers
needed photocopies I would make
photocopies and the meantime I would be
bored out of my skull this is pre iPhone
thank God to Steve Jobs for saving us
all from unending boredom but I used to
read the Wall Street Journal or anything
that I could get my hands on I would
have read the back of a brochure just to
keep from going insane because listening
to a bunch of corporate lawyers discuss
how to optimize my new details in a big
contract is really dull and they got mad
at me because they wanted me to sit
there quietly and not read The Wall
Street Journal they said that's rude
that's misbehavior so I got called up
and reprimanded a bunch of times and
then I was finally terminated and I was
sent home in shame early from my very
prestigious internship this
my chance of going to law school that I
was unhappy for all of an hour but
ultimately it's one of the best things
that ever happened to me because then I
would have ended up as a lawyer not that
I have anything against lawyers but it's
not what I was meant to do
you mentioned the catering job that you
had a while back that really kicked off
the whole obsession that was an Envy
thing when I was in high school I had to
make some money to pay for my first
semester at college and I had to get a
job it was the summer of 1990 1991
timeframe so this was the bush senior
recession if anyone who was alive back
then remembers it was actually really
hard to get a job so I ended up working
for an Indian food catering company and
I ended up having to serve at a birthday
party for a kid who it was actually in
my school so I saw my classmates and I
was out there serving food and drinks to
them and that was incredibly
embarrassing I wanted to hide away and
die right there but you know what it's
all part of the plan it's all part of
the motivation if I hadn't had that
happened I probably wouldn't be as
motivated and I wouldn't be as
successful so it's all fine but it was
definitely a very strong motivator in
that sense envy can be useful and we can
also eat you alive if you let a follow
you your entire life but there are
points in your life where it can be a
very powerful booster rocket
