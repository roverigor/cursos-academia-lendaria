let's talk about hard work there's this
battle that happens in Twitter a lot
between should you work hard and should
you not like David Hauser's on there
saying it's like your slave driving
people and Keith Robo is always on there
saying like no all the great founders
work their fingers to the bone and
they're talking past each other first of
all they're talking about two different
things David is talking about employees
in a lifestyle business which is fine
your number one thing in life if you're
doing that is not getting wealthy you
have a job you also have your family you
also have your life but Keith is talking
about the Olympics of startups he's
talking about the person going for the
gold medal and trying to build a
multi-billion dollar public company that
person has to get everything right they
have to have great judgment they have to
pick the right thing to work on they
have to recruit the right team and they
have to work crazy hard because they're
basically engaged in the competitive
sprint so if getting wealthy is your
goal you are going to have to work as
hard as you can but hard work is
absolutely no substitute for who you
work with and what you work on what you
work on is probably the most important
thing finding product market founder fit
to expand on Marc Andreessen definition
you came with product market fit but I
would add product market founder fit
which is how well you are personally
suited to that business the combination
that three that should be your
overwhelming goal and you can save
yourself a lot of time if you pick the
right area to work in picking the right
people to work with is the next most
important piece and then third comes how
hard you work but they're like three
legs of a stool if you shortchange in
any one of them the whole stool is gonna
fall down so it's not like you can pick
one over the other that easily so the
order operations when you're building a
business is or even building your career
is first figure out what should I be
doing what is something where there is a
market that is emerging there's a
product that I can build that I'm
excited to work on and something where I
have specific knowledge and I'm really
into it and then second surround
yourself with the best people possible
and no matter how high your bar is raise
your bar because you can never be
working with other people who are great
enough if there's someone greater out
there to work with you should go work
with them I advise a lot of people who
are looking at which started to join in
Silicon Valley I say basically pick the
one that's going to have the best alumni
network for you in the future look at
the PayPal mafia they work with a bunch
of geniuses so they all got rich so just
try and pick based on the highest Intel
energy and integrity people that you can
find and then finally once you've picked
the right thing to work on and the right
people to work with then you work as
hard as you can this is where the
mythology gets a little crazy people
will work 80 120 hour weeks a lot of
that's just status signaling it's
showing off
nobody really works 80 200 20 hours a
week sustained at high output with
mental clarity your brain breaks down
you just won't have good ideas so really
the way people tend to work most
effectively especially in knowledge work
is they sprint as hard as they can while
they're working on something and they're
inspired and they're passionate and then
they rest they take long breaks it's
more like a lion hunting and much less
like a marathon running and running so
you sprint then you rest you reassess
and then you try again in which you end
up doing is you end up building a
marathon of Sprint's maybe just made the
point to me on the side that inspiration
is perishable which is a very good point
when you have your inspiration do it
right then and there this happens to me
a lot with my tweet storms I've actually
come up with a whole bunch of additional
tweet stone besides the ones that are
already out there but sometimes I just
hesitate or I just pause and then it
just dies and what I've learned is if
I'm inspired to write a blog post or to
publish a tweet storm I should probably
do it right away
otherwise it's not gonna get out there I
won't come back to it so inspiration is
a beautiful and powerful thing and when
you have it just seize it so people talk
about impatience when do you know to be
impatient when you know to be patient my
glib tweet on this was impatience with
actions and patience with the results
and I think that's actually a good
philosophy for a life anything you have
to do just get it done
why wait you're not getting any younger
your life is slipping away you don't
want to spend it waiting in line you
don't want to spend it traveling back
and forth you don't want to spend it
doing things that you know ultimately
aren't part of your mission and when you
do them you want to do them as quickly
as you can while you do them well with
your full attention but then you just
have to give up on the results you have
to be patient with the results because
you deal with complex systems you didn't
with lots of people it takes a long time
for markets to adopt products it takes
time for people to get comfortable
working with each other it takes time
for great products to emerge as you
polish away polish away polish away so
impatience with actions patience with
results and as may be said inspiration
is perishable
so when you have inspiration act on it
right then and there if I have a problem
that I discovered one of my businesses
that needs to be solved I basically
won't sleep until at least the
resolution is in motion and this is just
a personal failing but if I'm on the
board of a company I'll call the CEO if
I'm running the company I'll call my
reports if I'm responsible I'll get on
there right then and there and solve it
if I don't solve a problem the moment it
happens or I don't start moving towards
solving when it happens I have no peace
I have no rest I have no happiness until
that problem is solved so solve it as
quickly as possible
I literally won't sleep until it's
solved maybe that's a personal
characteristic but it's worked out well
in business
