knowledge is the thing that makes
the existence of resources infinite the
creation of knowledge is unbounded we're
just going to keep on creating more
knowledge and thereby learning about
more and different resources there's
this wonderful parable of europium in
the beginning of infinity where david
talks about 60 years ago or so when
first color television started to be
manufactured they were cathode ray tube
type where you'd fire a stream of
electrons at a phosphorescent screen and
the phosphorescent screen have these
pixels three different colors one of
which was red
and those red phosphors on the screen
were filled with the element europium
and the interesting thing about europium
is when you put electricity through it
when you excite it it glows with this
red color and the extra interesting
thing about europium is it is the only
such element on the periodic table it's
the only chemical that will do that if
you fire electrons at it it will glow
the red that you need to have color
television now it was calculated that
there's only a certain amount of
european on the earth and that amount of
european was quickly being consumed by
cathode ray tube manufacturer so the
scientists had a perfectly robust
mathematical theory about how the number
of cathode ray tubes was finite
therefore they're going to run out of
cathode ray tubes and it's true in a
very narrow sense that for any given
resource you're going to have a finite
amount on planet earth of course there's
going to be european outer space and you
could probably mine it there but the
deep point is no one has cathode ray
tubes anymore the whole idea of color
television has nothing to do with the
excitation of europium these days we've
all got lcd screens we had plasma
screens and they'll probably be
something else coming in the future as
well that will have absolutely nothing
to do with the technology we have today
but we're still going to have color
television or color screens and this is
true for absolutely any resource that we
can think of you might very well make a
perfectly good malthusian calculation we
can't keep on burning wood if you happen
to be living on the african savanna
because eventually all the forests are
going to be burned down obviously we're
going to run out of wood there's a
finite amount of wood even if you can
grow more wood eventually the
consumption of wood is going to outstrip
the amount that's there and this is the
argument that's made for coal oil and
everything else that we happen to be
consuming even so-called empty space has
a lot of matter and a lot of things that
could be converted into energy there is
no limit to the amount of resources out
there there's purely a limit to
knowledge and unfortunately there's a
pessimistic assumption here that people
make that human creativity is bounded
and i think it's the people who
themselves have not built things who
have not created new things from scratch
who seem to feel this the most
