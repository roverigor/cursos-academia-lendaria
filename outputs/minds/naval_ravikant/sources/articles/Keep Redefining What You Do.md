we just finished talking about the
importance of working hard and valuing
your time next there's a few tweets on
the topic of working for the long term
the first tweet is become the best in
the world at what you do keep redefining
what you do until this is true if you
really want to get paid in this world
you want to be number one at whatever it
is that you're doing and it can be niche
that's the point it can literally be
you're getting paid for just being you
you know at this point some of the more
successful people in the world are that
way
Oprah gets paid for being Oprah Joe
Rogan gets paid for being Joe Rogan and
they're being authentic to themselves so
what this tweet is trying to say
simultaneously is that you want to be
number one but you want to keep changing
what you do until you're number one you
can't just pick something arbitrary you
can't say I'm gonna be the fastest
runner in the world and now you got to
beat the same bolt that's too hard of a
problem but what you can do is you can
keep changing what your objective is
until it arrives to your specific
knowledge your skill sets your position
your capabilities your location your
interests and then converges to making
you number one so when you're searching
for what to do you actually have two
different foci that you have to keep in
mind at all points and one of those is I
want to be the best at what I do and the
second is what I do is flexible so that
I am the best at it until you arrive at
a comfortable place we were like yes
this is something I can be amazing at
while still being authentic to who I am
and this is not going to be an overnight
discovery it's gonna be a long journey
but at least you know how to think about
it the most important thing for
companies to find product market fit I
would say the most important thing for
an entrepreneur is to find founder
product market fit where you are
naturally inclined to build the right
product which has a market and that's a
three focus problem which is you got to
make all three of those work at once if
you want to be successful in life you
just have to get comfortable managing
multivariate problems multiple objective
functions at once and this is one of
those cases where you have to map at
least two or three at once
