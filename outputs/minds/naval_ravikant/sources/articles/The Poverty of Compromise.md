this idea of questioning things that
he the two you thought were unassailable
in a particular domain for millennia
people were wondering about the best way
to conceive of what democracy is even
plato had this idea of what is democracy
and he had the question about who should
rule that's the whole idea of democracy
supposedly we'd have to figure out who
should rule should it be the philosophy
kings who should rule should it be the
population of citizens and he decided
that a mob would readily vote away the
rights of a minority that's what he
thought democracy was but papa
questioned this whole idea of looking at
what democracy was he went even deeper
and said democracy has got nothing to do
with who should rule democracy is the
system which allows you to remove
policies and rulers most efficiently
without violence and that's how you
judge different democratic systems so
you can actually make a judgment on
france england the united states canada
these places have better or worse kinds
of democracy we might all call them
democracy but to the extent that we're
actually able to get rid of the people
that we don't like from the democratic
system quickly efficiently easily
without violence that's the measure of a
good democratic system rather than
trying to figure out which system's
going to give us the best rulers that's
the same mistake as saying
what method of science is going to give
us the true theory no method of science
is going to give us the true theory
science is an error correcting mechanism
all we can hope for is to get rid of the
bad ideas and by doing that we've
corrected some of our errors and then we
can move forward to find something
that's a better theory than what we had
before which actually raises the idea of
how to make good decisions when you're
at loggerheads with someone else this
idea that compromise is supposed to be a
virtue of some kind and it's not it's
preferable to having a
violent confrontation if you've got two
people who otherwise can't possibly
reach an agreement and they're going to
get into a battle of some sort but if
you're in a situation where
a person a has id x and person b has
idea why
the common understanding of what a
compromise is is it's somewhere between
x and y person a won't get everything
they want and person b won't get
everything they want so let's come up
with a compromise this is theory zed
when that policy proves not to work we
shouldn't be surprised because neither
person a or person b actually ever
thought it was the best idea in the
first place at all they thought that x
or y was the correct idea so when they
implement zed what happens when it fails
is that no one learns anything person a
goes back to saying i always told you
that x was the correct idea and person b
goes back to saying i always told you
that idea y was the best idea so they
haven't made any progress whatsoever
they've shown that zed is wrong but no
one ever thought that zed was correct in
the first place so this is the poverty
of compromise and this is what you get
in science at certain times it's
everywhere in politics as well
