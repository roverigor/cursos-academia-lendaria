we skipped one tweet because I wanted to
cover all of the tweets on the topic of
the long term and the tweet that we
skipped was there are no get-rich-quick
schemes that's just someone else getting
rich off you this goes back to the world
being an efficient place if there's an
easy way to get rich it's already been
exploited and there are a lot of people
who will sell you ideas and schemes on
how to make money but they're just
always selling you some 7995 course or
some audio book or some seminar which is
fine everyone needs to eat people need
to make a living they might actually
have really good tips but if they're
giving you actionable high-quality
advice that acknowledges that it's a
difficult journey and will take a lot of
time then I think that's realistic but
if they're selling you some
get-rich-quick scheme whether it's
crypto or whether it's an online
business or seminar they're just making
money off you that's their
get-rich-quick scheme it's not gonna
necessarily work for you one of the
things about this whole tweet storm and
podcast is that we don't have ads on
here we don't charge for anything we
don't sell anything not because I don't
want to make more money it's always nice
to make more money we're doing work here
but because it would completely destroy
the credibility of the enterprise if I'm
saying hey I know how to get rich and
I'm gonna sell that to you it ruins it
when I was young and I was kind of
studying up on the topic one of my
favorite books on the topic was actually
called how to get rich by Felix Dennis
the founder of Maxim magazine
billionaire who passed away and he had a
lot of crazy stuff in there but he had
some really good insights too but
whenever I read something by him or by
the GoDaddy founder Bob Parsons or say
Andrew Carnegie or you read stuff by
people who are already very wealthy and
they've clearly made their wealth in
other fields not by selling the how to
get rich line they have a credibility
you just trust them and they're not
trying to make money off of you they are
obviously trying to win some status and
some ego right you always have to have a
motivation for doing something but at
least that is a cleaner reason why
they're probably not lying they're
probably not fooling you they're not
slowing you at some level every founder
has to lie to every employee of the
company that they have where they have
to convince them that it's better for
you to work for me
then is to do what I did and go work for
yourself so I've always had a
our time with that which is why the only
honest with in my companies I've
recruited entrepreneurs and I tell them
you're gonna get to be entrepreneurial
in this company and the day you're ready
to go start your own next thing I'm
gonna support you I'm never gonna get in
the way of you starting a company but
this can be a good place for you to
learn how to build a good team and build
a good culture how to find product
market fit to perfect your skills and
meet some amazing people while you
figure out exactly what it is you're
gonna do because positioning timing
deliberation are very important when
starting a company but what I've never
been able to do is look them in the face
and say you must be at your desk by 8:00
a.m. because I'm not gonna be at my desk
by 8:00 a.m. I want my freedom or say to
them that you're great at being a
director today and you'll be a VP
tomorrow you know putting them into that
career path track because I don't
believe in it myself if anyone is giving
advice on how to get rich and they're
also making money off of it they should
have made their money elsewhere like you
don't learn how to be fit from a fat
person you don't learn how to be happy
from a depressed person so you don't
want to learn how to be rich from a poor
person but you also don't want to learn
how to be rich from somebody who makes
their money by telling people how to be
rich it's suspect anytime you see
somebody who's actually gotten rich
following some gurus advice on getting
rich just remember that in any random
process if you run it long enough and if
enough people participate in it you will
always get every single possible outcome
with probability one there's a lot of
random error in there and then also this
is why you have to absolutely and
completely ignore business journalists
and economists academics when they talk
about private companies I won't even
name names but like when a famous
economist rails on Bitcoin or when a
business journalist attacks the latest
company that's IP owing it's complete
nonsense those people have never built
anything they're professional critics
they don't know anything about making
money all they know is how to criticize
and get page views and you are literally
becoming dumber by reading them you are
burning neurons I'll leave you with a
quote from the same Talab that I liked
where he said if you want to be a
philosopher King first become a king and
then become a philosopher and not first
become a philosopher and then become a
king I'm glad you brought up Tala
because I was going to finish this by
saying just remember the title of his
first book which
is fooled by randomness one of the
reasons why we're a little vague in this
podcast is because we're trying to lay
down principles that are timeless as
opposed to just giving you the winning
lottery ticket numbers from yesterday
