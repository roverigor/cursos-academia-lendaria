## Article Content

Naval Ravikant argued that cryptocurrencies will create a fifth protocol layer powering the next generation of the Internet.

### Core Argument

> "Cryptocurrencies will create a fifth protocol layer powering the next generation of the Internet."

### The Human vs Machine Distinction

**Humans don't need math-based cryptocurrencies when dealing with other humans:**
- We walk slowly, talk slowly, and buy big things
- Credit cards, cash, wires, checks – the world seems fine for human transactions

**Machines, on the other hand, are far chattier and quicker to exchange information:**
- The existing Four Layers of the Internet Protocol Suite (Link Layer, Internet Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer) are constantly communicating
- This network "transfers data but doesn't transfer value"

### The Key Question

> Where's the protocol layer for exchanging value, not just data, and where's the distributed, anonymous, permission-less system for chatty machines to allocate their scarce resources?

### The Vision

Naval posed that one day cryptocurrencies will be used by companies to:
- Transfer value
- Check contracts
- Track each transaction through the blockchain

The Fifth Protocol explores the possibility of a fifth protocol that could be used in computer-to-computer communications to transfer value, enabling a new generation of machine-to-machine commerce.

### Reception

The piece was published in April 2014 and generated discussion from notable tech investors like Fred Wilson, demonstrating Naval's early and prescient thinking about blockchain technology and cryptocurrency applications.
