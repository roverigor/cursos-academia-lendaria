the artificial general intelligence crew
gets this completely wrong too just add
more compute power and you'll get
intelligence when we don't really know
what it is underneath that makes us
creative and allows us to come with good
explanations
people talk a lot about gpt3 the text
matching engine that a i put out which
is a very impressive piece of software
but they say hey i can use gpt3 to
generate great tweet well that's because
first as a human you're selecting which
tweets out of all the garbage that it
generates are good second is using some
combination of plagiarism and synonym
matching and so on to come up with
plausible sounding stuff but the easiest
way to see that what's generating
doesn't actually make any sense is just
ask you to follow a question take a gpg3
generated output and ask it why why is
that the case or make a prediction based
on that and watch it completely fall
apart because there's no underlying
explanation it's parroting it's a
brilliant bayesian reasoning it's
reading from what it already sees out
there generated by humans on the web but
it doesn't have an underlying model of
reality
that can explain the scene in terms of
the unseen and i think that's critical
that is what humans do uniquely that no
other creature no other computer no
other
intelligence biological or artificial
that we have ever encountered does and
not only do we do it uniquely but if we
were to meet an alien species that also
had the power to generate these good
explanations
there is no explanation that they could
generate that we could not understand we
are maximally capable of understanding
there is no concept out there that is
possible in this physical reality that a
human being given sufficient time
resources and education could not
understand
