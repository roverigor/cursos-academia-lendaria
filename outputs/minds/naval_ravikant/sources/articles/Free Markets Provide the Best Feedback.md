mark andreessen summarizes this nicely
as strong opinions loosely held so as a
society if you're truth-seeking you want
to have strong opinions but very loosely
held you want to try them see if they
work and then error correct if they
don't but instead what we get is either
strong opinion strongly held which is
the intolerant minority or we get weak
opinions loosely held which is the
compromise model where no one really
takes blame no one gets credit no one
gets to try the way that they want to
and everybody can then fall back on real
communism hasn't been tried although in
that case real communism has been tried
it just hasn't worked out well as a
digression one of the common critiques
that i hear people say we need to move
to a post-capitalist world capitalism
isn't working okay well what is your
alternative and usually this is where
people start fumbling because there
aren't a lot of choices when you're
trying to figure out how to divvy up
credit divvy up resources and reward
people for their work you essentially
have two choices feedback from free
markets in reality and the best model
for that is money or you have feedback
from people which is where communism
ends up which is a group of people
decide that you did the best work now
who decides you did the best work
someone has to be in charge of doing
that invariably that ends up being the
biggest thug so i don't think it's an
accident that every communist country
degenerates into a dictatorship north
korea obviously run by the kim jong-il
family china paul fidel castro communism
never seems to actually be
run by a distributed majority of the
people it always ends up being run by a
bunch of people who are taking charge
because it's just human nature that if i
get to decide who gets the gold it's
going to go to my friend's family and
the people that i like and that's
invariably what ends up happening either
you need an objective function to carve
it up and money is the known objective
function or it becomes all subjective
and if it's subjective then who's to say
you carving it up instead of me we're
just going to decide based on who has
more physical force who has more guns
what we say on the side of free markets
is that what we've extracted out of that
decision-making process is the coercion
no one is forced into purchasing a
service undertaking an agreement the
only time the force is applied is when
the government gets involved the people
at the top then say this is the best
decision and you will all have to agree
with it otherwise there's going to be a
man with a badge and a gun turn up at
your door all that we're saying when it
comes to free market is that the
individual gets to decide without being
coerced what might work for them now
they could be wrong but why shouldn't
they try and make mistakes it's the only
way to make progress the only way to
error correct is to actually try
something else perhaps fail
