what's a mispriced externality you
mentioned that at some point during our
podcast and externalities when there is
an additional cost that is imposed by
whatever product is being produced or
consumed that is not accounted for in
the price of the product sometimes you
can fix that by putting the price back
into the product one of the most ardent
ways people attack capitalism these days
is that it's destroying the environment
and if you throw away capitalism because
destroying the environment then guess
what we're all headed back to
pre-industrial times there's not going
to be a good thing so rather there is an
externality because the environment is
finite the environment is freshest and
we have to price it properly and fold it
back in if people are wasting water or
putting hydrocarbons in the atmosphere
or polluting things you want to charge
them what it costs to clean up that
pollution return it to a pristine State
perhaps that price has to be very very
very high if you raise that price high
enough you knock out pollution it's much
better than feel-good measures where
we're just gonna ban plastic bags and
we're gonna say don't take showers and
Saturdays and Sundays when we're having
a drought California likes to run
declarations and ads to scare you into
not taking showers and times when
there's a drought when it would be just
much better to raise the price of fresh
water your average consumer might pay a
few pennies more for a shower
but then the almond farmers who consume
a lot of the water will cut back on
using fresh water and almond farming may
move to a part of the country where
water is more abundant properly pricing
externalities can save resources in a
tremendous way it's a good framework to
think about how to be effective when you
want to do things like save the
environment rather than feel-good things
that won't actually amount to anything
