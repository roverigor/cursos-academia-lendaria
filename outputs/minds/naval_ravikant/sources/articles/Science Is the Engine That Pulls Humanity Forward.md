welcome to the eponymous novel podcast
the main topic that we started out on
was timeless principles of wealth
creation and then we've been touching a
little bit on internal happiness and
peace and well-being
but i am first and foremost a student of
science and failed physicist if you will
i loved physics i wanted to pursue it
but i never felt i was going to be great
at it and i was pulled into more
technology which is applied science
nevertheless i've remained a student of
science i remain fascinated by it and
all of my real heroes are scientists
because i believe that
science is the engine that pulls
humanity forward
i've been lucky to live in an age where
scientific progress and technological
progress
seem not likely but inevitable so we've
gotten used to this idea that life
always gets better despite all the
complaining that goes on
about how productivity growth is
stagnant the reality is anyone who owns
a smartphone or drives a car
or even lives in a house has seen
technology improve their quality of life
over and over again we take this
progress for granted
and it's thanks to science so i continue
to
be fascinated by science and to me
science is also the study of truth
what do we know to be true how do we
know something to be true and as i get
older i find myself incapable
of having attention span for anything
which is not steeped in truth
so the background on this particular
podcast series
is i thought i knew a lot about science
and there was a lot about science that i
took for granted such as what scientific
theory is and
how scientific theories are formed most
of us have a vague idea of it
and it can range from some people think
science is what scientists do
which has a definitional problem as in
what is a scientist
and other people think well science is
making falsifiable or testable
predictions and maybe that's closer to
it
and then sometimes people say what's the
scientific method and what is the
scientific method
and then they start describing their
junior high school chemistry experiment
and
lose the trail after that especially in
these days where we're told to
quote unquote believe in science which
is an oxymoron
people respect science but they don't
understand what science is
the idea of what science is is getting
hijacked sometimes by well-meaning
people who want to convince you of the
science and sometimes by not so
well-meaning people who just want to
influence the way that you think and
feel and act
