so we covered the skills that you need
to get rich so that was specific
knowledge accountability leverage
judgment and lifelong learning let's
talk a little bit about the importance
of working hard and valuing your time so
no one is going to value you more than
you value yourself so you just have to
set a very high personal hourly rate and
you have to stick to it
so even since when I was young I just
decided that I was worth a lot more than
the market thought I was worth but I
started treating myself that way so
always factor your time into every
decision how much time does it take oh
it's gonna take me an hour to get across
town to get this thing well I value
myself at $100 an hour that's basically
throwing a hundred dollars out of my
pocket am I gonna do that
you buy something from Amazon they
screwed it up you have to return it is
it worth your time to return it is it
worth the mental hassle keep in mind
that you have less work hours you have
less mentally high-output hours do you
want to use them to run errands and
solve little problems or do you want to
save them for the big stuff all the
great scientists were terrible at
managing their household life none of
them had a clean organized room or you
know made all their social events on
time or sent their thank-you cards you
can spend your life however you want but
if you want to get rich it has to be
your number one overwhelming desire
which means that it has to come before
anything else which means you can't be
penny-pinching this is what people
understand you can penny pinch your way
to the basic sustenance you can keep
your expenses low maybe you retire early
and not spend too much and that's
perfectly valid but we're here to talk
about wealth creation and if you're
gonna do that then that has to be your
number one overwhelming priority so
fast-forward to your wealthy self and
pick some intermediate hourly rate for
me believe it or not back when you could
have hired me which now obviously can't
but back when you could have hired me
and this was true a decade ago or even
two decades ago before I had any real
money my hourly rate I used to say to
myself over and over is five thousand
dollars an hour today and when I look
back really was about a thousand dollars
an hour and of course I still ended up
doing stupid things like arguing with
electrician or returning the broken
speaker but I shouldn't have and I did a
lot less than any of my friends would
and I would make a theatrical show out
of throwing something in the trash
or giving to Salvation Army rather than
trying to return it or handing something
to people rather than trying to fix it I
would argue with my girlfriends and even
today to my wife like I don't do that
that's not a problem that I solve I
still argued that with my mother when
she hands me like little to news I just
don't do that I would rather hire you an
assistant and this was true even when I
didn't have money another way of
thinking about something is if you can
outsource something or not do something
for less than your hourly rate outsource
it or don't do it so if you can hire
someone to do it for less than your
hourly rate hire them that even includes
things like cooking now if you may want
to eat your healthy home-cooked meals
but if you can outsource it do that
instead and I know some people will say
well what about the joy of life and what
about getting it right just your way
sure you can do that but you're not
gonna be wealthy because now you've made
something else a priority Paul Graham
basically said it pretty well for Y
Combinator startups you said you should
be working on your product and getting
product market fit and you should be
exercising and eating healthy like
that's about it that's kind of all you
have time for while you're on this
mission so set a very high hourly
aspirational rate for yourself and stick
to it and it should seem and feel
absurdly high if it doesn't it's not
high enough and whatever you picked on
my advice to you would be raise it like
I said for myself even before I had
money for the longest time I used five
thousand dollars an hour and if you
extrapolate that out into what it looks
like his annual salary it's multiple
millions of dollars per year ironically
I actually think I've beaten it but I
look back because I'm not the
hardest-working person I'm actually kind
of a lazy person so I worked through
bursts of energy where I'm really
motivated or something so if I actually
look at how much I've earned per actual
hour that I put in is probably quite a
bit higher than that
