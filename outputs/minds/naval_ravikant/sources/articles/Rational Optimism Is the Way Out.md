in general professions in which you get
your feedback from
other members of that profession tend to
get corrupted when you see a journalist
writing articles to impress
other journalists or a restauranteur
running a restaurant that's
designed to impress other foodies and
other restaurateurs
those end up not being practical and
high quality
they may receive accolades and prizes
within certain elite circles
but they're not reflecting reality where
someone who is getting feedback from
either mother nature like a scientist or
an experimentalist
or from free markets where other people
are voting with their money and their
time
those are going to be much better
predictors the people who are operating
in the real world
and are getting paid for it tend to be
optimists the people who are operating
ivory towers
are incented to be pessimists to be an
entrepreneur you need to be optimistic
about the fact that
you're creating something that other
people are going to find value in
and people who have a pessimistic
philosophy tend to have a pessimistic
psychology as well if you're constantly
thinking about all the ways in which the
world is going to rack and ruin
then this has a day-to-day impact upon
your
outlook on the rest of society and on
your family on your friends
on everything because you think that
this world is condemned
so you're going to feel that weight upon
your shoulders
and it's going to come through in the
way in which you present yourself to the
rest of the world
we see a lot of this on social media
right now entrepreneurs are typically
too busy to spend a whole lot of time on
social media but you do get
scientists academic journalists who are
depressed with life because they have a
pessimistic view of reality and that's
got to have an
impact upon their subjective experience
of the world
unlike people who are creating trying to
bring something new into existence
unfortunately the pessimism is
self-fulfilling and here
we take the stance that all evils are
due to lack of knowledge
rational optimism is the way out the
data supports it history supports it
and we can always come up with good
explanations through creativity
to improve our lives and everybody
else's lives so stay optimistic
