we spoke earlier about picking a
business model that has leverage from
scale economies network effects zero
marginal cost of replication but there
were a few other ideas on the cutting
room floor that I want to go through
with you the first one was the
principal-agent problem so mental models
are all the rage everyone's trying to
become smarter by adopting mental models
I think mental models are interesting
but I don't think explicitly in terms of
a mental model checklist I know Charlie
Munger does but that's just not how I
think instead I tend to focus on the few
lessons that I've learned in life over
and over that I think are incredibly
important and seem to apply almost
universally one that keeps coming up
from microeconomics because as we've
established macroeconomics is not really
worth spending time on is what's called
the principal agent problem principal in
this case is principal with the P al not
ple so it's not a principal that you
follow
it's a principal who is a person who is
an owner a principal is an owner and an
agent is the person who works for the
owner so if you can think of it as an
employee the difference being a founder
an employee I can summarize this by a
famous quote that either was said by
Napoleon or by Julius Caesar it's
generally attributed to either one but
he said if you want it done then go
if not then send which is basically
saying if you want to do something right
do it yourself because other people just
don't care enough now the
principal-agent problem pops up
everywhere in microeconomics the way
that they try to characterize it is that
the principal's incentives are different
than the agents incentives so the owner
of the business wants what is best for
the business and will make the most
money the agent generally wants whatever
will look good to the principal or might
make them the most friends in the
neighborhood or in the business or might
make them personally the most money you
see this coming up a lot with hired gun
CEOs running public companies where the
ownership of the public company is
distributed so widely that there's no
principle remaining so nobody owns more
than 1% of the company the CEO takes
charge and stuffs the board with their
buddies and then starts issuing
themselves low price stock options or
doing a lot of stock
Bax because their compensation is based
directly tied to the stock price so
agents have a way of hacking systems
this is what makes incentive design so
difficult as Charlie Munger says if you
can be working on incentives don't work
on anything else almost all human
behavior can be explained by incentives
and the study of signalling and signals
is seeing what people do despite what
they say people are much more honest
with their actions and they are with
their words you have to get the
incentives right to get people to behave
correctly it's a very very difficult
problem because the good people aren't
purely coin-operated
they're not just looking for money
they're also looking for other things
like status or meaning in what they do
principal agent problem is the one that
as a business owner you're always going
to be trying to figure out how do I make
this person think like me how do i
incent them how do I give them founder
mentality and I think you have to truly
have been a founder to fully appreciate
how important this founder mentality
thing is and what a difficult and gnarly
problem the principal-agent problem is
what I would say to you is if you are a
principal you essentially want to spend
a lot of your time thinking about this
problem what that means is you want to
take your top lieutenants and you want
to be very generous with them in terms
of ownership and incentives even if they
don't necessarily realize it because
over time they will and you want them to
be aligned with you in how they operate
when you do business deals it's better
to have an aligned partnership where you
both have the same incentives then a
partnership where you got the advantage
in the deal you negotiate in such a way
that you've got the better end of the
transaction because eventually the other
person will figure it out or they'll be
misaligned and somebody else there will
start doing misaligned things and the
partnership will fall apart either way
it's not gonna be one of those things
that you can invest into with the
benefits of compound interest over
decades and then finally if you're in a
current role where you're an agent
you're an employee your most important
job is to think like a principal the
more you can think like a principal the
better off you're going to be long term
because it's training you how to be a
principal long term and eventually you
will become a principal it's also going
to align you with the principal and a
good principal will then
promote you or empower you or give you
accountability or leverage way out of
proportion to what might be your menial
role I'm always very impressed by
founders who will promote up very very
young people through the ranks having
them skip multiple levels despite their
experience and invariably it happens
because this agent who's way deep down
thinks like a principal so if you can
hack your way through the principal
agent problem you've probably solved
half of what it takes to run a company
the reason I asked about this one first
is because I feel like I personally
never see the principal agent problem in
my work I tend to work in small teams
where everybody is highly economically
aligned and the people have been
filtered for a commitment to the mission
and everybody else who doesn't work out
moves on to another role elsewhere these
are all heuristics that you have
designed to avoid having to deal with
the single biggest problem in management
another example of a heuristic you can
have that helps you route around the
principal agent problem is they deal
with the smallest firm as possible so
for example when I'm hiring a lawyer or
a banker or even accountant to work on
my deals one of the things that I've
become very cognizant about is the
bigger firms all the other things equal
are generally worse yes they have more
experience yes they have more people yes
they have a bigger brand but what you'll
find is that the principal and the agent
are highly separated and very often the
principal will sell you and convince you
to work with the firm but then all the
work will be done by an agent who simply
doesn't care as much and you can end up
getting substandard service so I prefer
to work with boutiques and my ideal law
firm to work with is a law firm of one
my ideal banker to work with is a solo
banker now you're making other
sacrifices and trade-offs in terms of
that person's resources and you are
betting big in that person but you've
got one throat to choke there's no one
else to point fingers to there's nowhere
to run the accountability is extremely
high if you're an agent the best way to
operate is just
say what wouldn't the founder do if you
think like the owner and you act like
the order it's only a matter of time
until you become the owner
