induction also says that prediction is
the main reason for the existence of
science but it's not
it's explanation you want an explanation
of what's going on
even if you can't necessarily predict
with any certainty what's going to
happen next
in fact knowing what's going to happen
next with some degree of certainty can
be deflating and the unknown can be far
more fun than having
absolute certitude about what tomorrow
will bring this brings us to the related
point the science has never settled we
should always be free to have new
creativity a new conjecture
you never know where the best ideas are
going to come from and you have to take
everything that's made in good faith
seriously and so this idea that the
science is settled or the science is
closed is nonsense
and it implies that we can all agree
upon the process with which we come up
with new theories
rather through creativity and conjecture
and the door is always open for new
people with new ideas to come in and do
that
as popper said we're all equal in our
infinite ignorance so even if someone
claims expertise
they might even be valid in their claim
to expertise there's an infinite number
of things they do not
know and those infinite number of things
they do not know could affect the things
they do know
so the child who is coming through
school who
is not expert in anything can still come
up with an idea
that can challenge the foundations of
the greatest expert because the expert
like the child
is ignorant about a whole bunch of
things they could have error that does
not preclude someone else
who lacks that fine-tuned knowledge from
being able to point out
there's an error and here's a better
idea
