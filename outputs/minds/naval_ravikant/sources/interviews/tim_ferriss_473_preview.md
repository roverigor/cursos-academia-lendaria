**Naval Ravikant: **Yeah, thanks for having me. If I recall correctly, I was crushed in Podcast of the Year by Jamie Foxx, so—



**Tim Ferriss: **That's right. So Jamie Foxx—



**Naval Ravikant: **I need weaker competition this time around. If you could just tone it down this year, please.



**Tim Ferriss: **I will do my best, yeah. Jamie, basically, I could have been a completely non-responsive, critical care patient; as long as the equipment functioned, Jamie Foxx is the consummate performer. So he is formidable competition of podcasts, but you are a different breed. And I understand that you get asked to do podcasts a lot. So what type of disclaimer would you like to apply?



**Naval Ravikant: **Oh, yeah. I don't go on other people's podcasts anymore, I had to make an exception for you because you are the OG. You put me on the map, you're a good friend and frankly, I wouldn't even be known if it weren't for you. So I definitely have to thank you and honor your request to have me back. I generally don't do podcasts anymore or at least other people's podcasts for a couple of reasons. First is, I just don't believe in sequels, I think sequels suck, right? You look at sequels in movies and whatnot and they're usually pretty bad. They cost three times as much, they're long-winded. The person now has an ego and a reputation to defend. They've already said what they were going to say so they're just repeating themselves to some level.



And, maybe the first run, they took an idea they've had for a decade or three decades and they expounded on it and it sounded great. And then in the sequel, whether it's a book or a movie, they have to come up with something equally good, but they only have two years to do it. And it's just really difficult to do. So I think sequels just make everybody look bad, and I'm not a fan of sequels. Yet here we are. The thing about sequels is they make money, people want them, people crave them because there's a certain familiarity to it, but hopefully we won't embarrass ourselves too much. So yeah, I don't do sequels; we'll make an exception here and kind of see how it goes. Just don't have Jamie Foxx back on—at least not this year.



**Tim Ferriss: **Well, I am looking right now, as a framework for starting this conversation, at your Twitter account. And that might seem like an odd place for me to start. People who listen to this show a lot will know that I don't often do that, but I want to know two things. You follow zero people on Twitter, yet you have almost a million followers and also trending right now in the United States is Jamie Foxx. I just find that hilarious! He's right next to [crosstalk]. Cannot keep this guy down. So let's talk about your account. I find your account fascinating, I find your use of Twitter fascinating, and I'd like to begin with a photograph of a professor at a blackboard that you have as your profile, I suppose header. Who is the person in the photograph? I think I recognize this person, but I want to hear you describe why you chose this photograph and who it is.



**Naval Ravikant: **Yeah, that's Professor Richard Feynman, who was a pioneer in the field of quantum electrodynamics. He was part of the Manhattan Project. He's known colloquially for his book *Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!* And a couple of related ones like *What Do You Care What Other People Think?* But he's also very well-regarded in the field of physics, obviously. He passed away a while back, but he invented a lot of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman path integrals, he was part of the Manhattan Project. A brilliant, brilliant guy. And I loved him because Feynman was one of the first characters that I encountered that did science and serious work and was accomplished in so-called real life. He was a character, he was a happy person. He was deeply philosophical, he didn't take himself nor life too seriously. He appreciated the mysteries of life, he appreciated living life and he had a lot of fun along the way. To me, he was like a full-stack intellectual hacker of life. And was just very inspirational to me as a kid, growing up.



And even though I read a lot of philosophy and just kind of normal non-fiction, my hero and even though I'm in the business world, the tech world, my heroes are scientists because I think applied science is the engine that pulls humanity forward. It eventually becomes technology. That technology allows us to engage in all kinds of pursuits around civilization, rather than be scrapping for just basic subsistence and survival. And so I think scientists are still the most unsung heroes of human history, and Feynman was one of the greats. And he was admirable in many regards as to how he lived his life. Although I think recently they tried to cancel him, but they try to cancel everybody.



**Tim Ferriss: **Feynman is a character, certainly he is a character, was a character and a figure who has fascinated me for decades. And actually, I collect very few things but managed to buy some of his papers and drawings at auction a handful of years ago because it was the first time that they had been made available. So hey, I can show you some of his equations from the Manhattan Project, which is wild to think about. And my fascination though is, in many respects, uninformed because I don't have the scientific literacy to fully appreciate the genius that he brought to bear on physics for instance, but I could appreciate his cleverness and his questioning of assumptions and also his distaste for uniforms and other accolades. Most notably, some of the prizes that he was awarded, that he seemed to have particular dislike for on some level.



**Naval Ravikant: **Yeah. He famously said that science is the belief in the ignorance of experts. And it's so funny because these days, so many people are on Twitter saying, "Believe in science," or "According to science." And you have to realize there's no such thing as science with a capital S. The foundation of science is doubt. It is all about falsifiability. David Deutsch, who's kind of one of my current modern living physicist heroes, is a Popperian. He subscribes to Karl Popper's philosophy. And he basically says that if it's not falsifiable, it's not scientific. If you can't prove it false. If it's true up or down or left or right, it's not science, it doesn't require belief, you should be able to challenge it at all times. It should make risky predictions that are not obvious, and those predictions should then be tested and you shouldn't be able to, after the fact, move the goalposts or change how the predictions were set up.



And so those are the hallmarks of good science. Falsifiability, independent verifiability, and making risky and narrow predictions with details that are hard to vary both before and after the fact. And that's how you end up with good science and good explanations, not by people on Twitter or voting. That's politics. So everything has become politics now; science has become politics, too. People are politicizing, there's a big science, but I think Feynman would be very unhappy with that. He was just a generally happy character and non-political, intended not to get involved in these things. But I think he would realize that, that is not actually science, but it's masquerades of science, it's almost becoming social science and going to Twitter. Nassim Taleb is one of my favorite Twitter followers, even though he's a bit—



**Tim Ferriss: **Cantankerous?



**Naval Ravikant: **Yeah. He's cantankerous. He annoys people for sure, but you want to hear the truth, you got to be prepared to be hurt a little bit. But he had a great tweet recently that I retweeted, which I'm sure made a lot of people mad, where he said, "The opposite of education is not ignorance. The opposite of education is an education in social science." And I thought that was hilarious, but it hurts because there's some truth to it. If there was no truth to it, it wouldn't hurt at all. If I said, "Tim Ferriss is fat," that would just bounce right off of you. But if I said, "Tim Ferriss and Naval are fake gurus," that might hit us, right?



Because we kind of suspect at some deep level, there's a part of that, that's true. So I think the same way with social science does kind of lead you down the road to ignorance because it's about social and anything social is about groupthink and group behavior. And individuals can search for truth, but groups search for consensus because if a group doesn't have consensus, it can't get along. If it can't get along, it falls apart and there's conflict. And so the last place you're going to find truth is in large groups and the moment you make science about large groups and about voting and about consensus, you're not really practicing science anymore.



**Tim Ferriss: **Yeah, and the science with a capital S is dangerous.



**Naval Ravikant: **Very dangerous.



**Tim Ferriss: **As you mentioned —



**Naval Ravikant: **Yeah, it's propaganda. Then it becomes macroeconomics. Again, another Taleb line, he says, "It's easier to macro bullshit than it is to micro bullshit." And so, big sciences, he called it macroeconomics. Whereas they're calling microeconomics, little science, which is me in a lab or me with my computer trying out various things. Just like with macroeconomics, you can pick and choose whatever data you want to prove, whatever point you want with big science, you can pick or choose whatever papers you want. So look at the fights right now on the internet about what COVID means. You can go down that hall of mirrors and find scientific quote, unquote, substantiation for many points of view, depending on which papers you choose to cherry-pick. And so then we reduce back to consensus, but again, science isn't done by consensus.



It should be done by experimentation, verifiability, falsifiability, rigorous testing. And in an ideal science world, you don't go and survey 10,000 scientists. You actually pick the one smartest scientist. But that's very hard to do now. No one can agree on who the smartest scientist is. So unfortunately I think that the nature of what science is, is being corrupted and that started the day we let the so-called social sciences masquerade as sciences. The day we said psychology is a science, and politics can be a science, and so on. And you can apply the scientific methods to those things. Then I think that's the day we started to corrupt science or at least the word science. So real science these days is relegated to a very small corner. Physics, maybe molecular biology and chemistry, mathematics, theory of computation, but it's a fairly limited set.



**Tim Ferriss: **Yeah. A very quantitatively literate friend of mine said at one point, "Most of the disciplines that have science at the end of them are not actually science." Although there are some exceptions, right? So computer science.



**Naval Ravikant: **Computer science.



**Tim Ferriss: **Neuroscience, if it's hard, neuroscience would be an exception, but very often, if there's science appended to it, it is not in fact, something that is falsifiable, according to someone like Karl Popper, right? It cannot be proven or disproven using experiments.



**Naval Ravikant: **That's right. If there isn't some experiment that could theoretically disprove it, then it's not science. Yeah. It's like Honest Abe's Law Firm, right? If he needs to put "honest" in the title, then you have to wonder! So the same way with "science" in the word, other than, as you said, computer science and neuroscience, you sort of have to wonder.



**Tim Ferriss: **Well, let's look at a couple of quotes from Feynman. There are few that I think about a lot and these are on Goodreads, but number one—and I think this is really applicable with respect to science in media, particularly a term that bothers me a lot, which is, "studies prove" or "studies show." Just like "capital S science shows," which isn't really a thing. The facts can get contorted quite a lot. The quote from Feynman is: "I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something." Right? So in other words—



**Naval Ravikant: **This is a very deep point. And I think that a lot of times that we just define something with another definition, or we just throw out a piece of jargon as if that means we know something. And it's a difference between memorization and understanding. Understanding is a thing that you want. You want to be able to describe it in 10 different ways, in simple sentences from the ground up and re-derive, whatever you need. If you just memorize, you're lost. So I think this is one of the things that I get stuck on a lot, which is, just keep going back and reading the basics over and over, trying to understand them. So don't necessarily have that tall edifice of knowledge, that that is very seductive in academia. But as anyone who's operated much in the real world knows, in the real world, you get paid for making good judgments and decisions based on the basics.



For example, if you know arithmetic, statistics, probability at a high level, and you understand some basic math, you have all the math that you need to succeed in life. You don't need calculus or even trigonometry or number theory or set theory or any of these kinds of things unless you're going into a deeply technical field of mathematics. Yet we spend so much of our time in school covering pre-calc and calculus when the kids who were taking those courses aren't even that good at basic math. So the basics are really important. That's the steel frame, the foundation for understanding that you need to get through life and too much of it is reduced to memorization and understanding things as names and as definitions. And I think the Feynman example is, his dad would take him for walks and they would see birds. And his dad would say, "This bird is such and such a warbler," but that doesn't tell you anything about the bird; that tells you about humans.



And humans gave that bird that name. Really the bird, it likes to stand on one leg at this point and it likes to pick lice in its feathers, doing this, and it likes to eat these kinds of things. And it flies this way for that reason and that these are its predators and these are its prey. So, I mean, those are the kinds of things that really give you understanding. Who cares what the bird is called? The name of the bird is irrelevant. In professional life, this happens a lot, which is jargon.



People try to protect their knowledge by basically saying, "Well, I understand this term and that term and what this term means." But the reality is, most people don't actually know what these things mean underneath. I find this very common in accounting. A lot of business people don't know accounting, and even a lot of accountants will have fancy words for things. But when you dig underneath, they don't really understand the principle of what's going on below it. And if you just understand the principles, and even if you don't understand the words, you will have an advantage in, for example, negotiating deals, because you will understand underneath how the pieces are actually moving on the board, as opposed to what they're called.



**Tim Ferriss: **And I just want to point out—developing that foundational knowledge is akin to learning the basics of shooting foul throws in basketball. It is not becoming Michael Jordan, right? With a very limited set of colors with which to paint. If you spend a few days with a decent YouTube tutorial or book, gathering the basics of accounting, you will be able to make significantly better decisions, right? I just want to underscore that this is not a master's degree or a PhD or any type of commitment like that, that can separate you from the pack in terms of advantage.



**Naval Ravikant: **Well, just run a business. Running a lemonade stand will teach you better accounting than a textbook. Now you may need to learn certain conventions because you need those to communicate with other humans. So that there's efficient communication. When you say one thing, they understand that thing, and that's where jargon can be useful because it can be a compressed way of communicating knowledge rather than having to try and explain it from first principles every time. But when it's not useful is when it becomes a substitute for understanding. Understanding is the thing. That's what separates humans from the other animals.



That's what separates us from the robots, that we actually understand what's going on underneath. For example, in the artificial intelligence world, there's a new algorithm, GPT3, which is the rage, which is text completion. So people are saying, "Hey, I can make up really plausible sounding writing. And so the AI is here and it's going to take all the jobs." Well, no, because the AI doesn't actually know what's going on underneath. If I were to ask it a question of, "Well, why did you write that?" Or "What does that mean?" It would very quickly fall apart.



So you always want to strive for understanding, not for memorization. You should be able to re-articulate it five different ways in every language that you know. Otherwise, you don't really understand it. And the good news is, you don't have to understand that many things. While we're on the topic of Feynman, one of the quotes from him is he says, "Nature uses only the longest threads to weave her tapestry." And so what he means by that is that there's only a few basic principles that you have to understand to kind of understand the sum total of our knowledge in physics. There's not a lot. And as physics becomes more and more advanced, we're actually unifying theories. We're collapsing them into one thing like we do with electricity and magnetism or statistical mechanics and heat and thermodynamics. Those turn out to be one thing.



We're trying to do currently with gravity and quantum mechanics, we're trying to reconcile them in quantum loop gravity or in string theory, or what have you. So you just kind of have to understand a few of the basic things and then you'll see them recurring over and over and over again. For example, I study and read physics and computer science just for entertainment. There's no practical application for me, but there's this really interesting theory I was reading about called Solomonoff induction. And it's basically formalized as Occam's razor, which is that the shortest answer is the correct one. But it's more advanced than that.



But it basically says, if you want to figure out why something happened, you take all the different reasons why it could have happened, all the different theories why it could have happened. And then you sort of weigh each of them based on how compressed they are, how short they are, how likely they are. That kind of gives you the explanation for why that theory happened. Now, Feynman has a very similar and elegant thing in a completely different field where he basically says, "If you want to understand why this particle took that path, why did this photon take that path? What you do is, you look at all the possible paths that a photon could have taken, and you sort of weigh them. You sum them probabilistically based on how likely that path was." It's actually the same observation, except one is about photons traveling through time. And the other is about the causality and why an event may have happened. And what the theory is behind that.



And these are two completely different fields and two completely different characters, thinking about two completely different things. And these are very, very fundamental theories in their fields, but deep down, they're actually the same, which to me is fascinating. It just shows how much of what we look at as complexity actually emerges from a set of very simple rules. And it's just fascinating. So understanding is a thing to strive for, not the word. So even though you use the fancy words like Solomonoff induction and finance path, integral theory, whatever the heck it's called—I don't even know what the actual name is—the name is irrelevant; it's the concept that's fascinating.



**Tim Ferriss: **You spoke to learning accounting through building a business. Let's segue to business. Your pinned tweet is a tweetstorm. So it's a series of tweets, the headline of which is, "How to get rich," and then in parentheses, "without getting lucky." It has, as we record this, 44,800 retweets, 110+1,000 favorites. We're not going to go through this whole thing; it's quite long. But I'm curious to know what parts of it you think people are paying too much attention to or over-emphasize and what parts of it do you wish people would pay more attention to? Because there are many different pieces of advice in this thread.



**Naval Ravikant: **Yeah, that tweetstorm is a series of principles that I kind of wrote for myself in my head when I was 13 and I was trying to figure out how to make money. And it kind of came up with a framework of how to be rich, but not by accident, to do it in a way that I could repeat it over and over. And I would leave very little up to chance because I think there's kind of this—it's not completely mythology, but there's this belief that to make money, you have to be born rich, or you have to be privileged, or you have to be in the right circles, you have to get lucky. And I think that there are still ways to accomplish the original American dream, which is make money, but do it in a deliberate, systematic way.



And when I say money, I mean wealth, I don't mean a law firm where you make a couple of hundred bucks an hour, but you're still tied to the clock. I mean, when you wake up when you want, you go to sleep when you want, you live where you want, and you have freedom. So to me, the purpose of money is freedom. And for that, you need to create wealth and can you do it ethically? Can you do it sustainably? Can you do it reliably? Can you do it with people that you like, can you do it doing things that you enjoy? And I think it's absolutely possible. And I like to think that I'm at least one of many living proof points for that. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger are examples of others. Not that I'm in their status or their league, but other people have done it.



So that was the whole point of that framework. And the tweetstorm, I just wrote it down one day. And it's funny because obviously, I have some experience at Twitter, so I know how to craft things. But I think that was written back in the day when the tweet limit was 140 characters too. So it was harder, but I just woke up one night when I'd been thinking about it and I wrote out the whole tweetstorm, almost exactly like you see it. And there are lots and lots of missing pieces. Obviously, that is just a very high level, very Zen koan-like, or, or haiku-like, or even in Hallmark card-like framework. it's missing a ton of details, which I then tried to extrapolate in my podcast series on the same topic.



**Tim Ferriss: **What do people overemphasize, and what are people missing?



**Naval Ravikant: **I think—



**Tim Ferriss: **And actually, Naval, let me pause and just read a few of them. This is from May 31, 2018. So a few examples, and you don't have to comment on these specific examples, but just for people who haven't seen this, I want to give them an idea. So the second of these various tweets in this sequence is, "Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you." End of that particular tweet. And then there's another one, "You're not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity, a piece of a business, to gain your financial freedom."



**Naval Ravikant: **That one right there is the most important one. Which is, in modern life, what happens is the person who is the best at doing something in the world will get to do it for the entire world through a combination of leverage and distribution, accountability, and specific knowledge. All of which I talk about in the tweetstorm. If you're the best in the world at doing something, if you're the best teacher in the world at math, you should be teaching the entire world math. If you're the best podcast interviewer, you should be doing all the top interviews and their returns will accrue to you, especially in this highly digital world where we live in, where the cost of distributing something is very close to zero. And so what you kind of want to do is, you want to productize yourself into a business, and then you want to own that business.



That is the way to make wealth. A clear example is the Tim Ferriss podcast and the Tim Ferriss brand, right? It's an eponymous brand. Your name is on it. You're leveraged through this podcast and through the books you write and through the army of followers that you have on the various media platforms. And you're taking on big accountability and there's specific knowledge. Only you know how to be Tim Ferriss, the learning machine who can then connect to other learners and extract value out of them and share that with the audience. So that's an example of you having productized yourself. But ultimately, you own the Tim Ferriss business. Now you can go lower levels down from that. You don't have to own the entire business. You could be an investor in public equities or private stocks. You could be a partner in a private business. You could be an employee of a startup where you have stock options, but if you don't own a piece of a business, it's going to be extremely hard to get wealthy.



It would be nearly impossible, almost not worth that route. So I think that is the most important foundational tweet. I think, where people kind of miss the plot the most though, is we have pain avoidance in life. We don't want to face things where it's clear we have made bad decisions because one good definition of suffering is that, that's the moment when you see things that they clearly are, and you kind of don't like what you see. Like, for example, if you and your spouse have been fighting for a long time, you've kind of been sweeping it under the rug and you've sort of been suffering along, but you're sweeping it under the rug, and then you get divorced. At that moment you can no longer unsee all the damage that was in the relationship and what all the consequences are.



They're real. The same way if you haven't been taking care of your health, but then suddenly you find out that you've just fallen off a cliff and something irreversibly bad has happened. The moment of suffering arrives and you're in pain because you can no longer unsee this thing. You can no longer avoid it. So I think the same way—the unfortunate part is that a lot of these principles are written for young people because you can set yourself on a certain trajectory in life earlier.



And so, for example, if you went and you got a PhD in a social science, and now I'm basically saying, "Hey, learn to code," you're going to avoid that. You're not going to want to see that because you have all this sunk cost in the degree. So I think a lot of people don't want to pick up the new skills that are necessary, or they don't want to, for example, physically move, or they don't want to disappoint the people and the relationships that they already have to make room for new relationships.



So everybody wants to start where they are. Nobody wants to go back down the mountain to find the path going at the top. Everybody wants to stay on the path they're on, maybe make a few tweaks and get to the top or like Charlie Munger jokes. You know, people always ask me like, "How do I get to be rich like you, except quicker? I don't want to be an old rich guy. I want to be the young rich guy."



So I think these are the hard parts. The hard parts are not the learning, it is the unlearning. It's not the climbing up the mountain. It's the going back down to the bottom of the mountain and starting over. It's the beginner's mind that every great artist, or every great business person has, which is: you have to be willing to start from scratch. You have to be willing to hit reset and go back to zero.



Because you have to realize that what you already know, and what you're already doing, is actually an impediment to your full potential. And most people just don't want to acknowledge that. And I'm guilty of that too. That's just human nature. I'm not faulting anybody for it, but it's just human nature.

**Tim Ferriss: **And if we look at your specific case, as it relates to equity, you mentioned owning part of a business. You also mentioned in this conversation, productizing yourself. So would you view your success in following that principle predominantly in, for instance, the equity that you own in a company like AngelList, or is it the identity and the brand meaning associations that you've built as Naval the human, or is it slash investor, therefore being sought after as an investor? Or is it something else?



How would you think of that principle as applying it most in your own life? Because you've created wealth, not just through say your equity and AngelList, but also through many successful investments. And then I'm sure there are other ways that we could identify wealth as coming from your path that you have.



**Naval Ravikant: **Yeah, what I like about my path is that I've made money doing a lot of different little things. So I've made money consistently in sort of small to medium-sized chunks. I haven't had like one gigantic payday that set me up forever. Although it depends on your standards. I'm talking about by Silicon Valley standards, obviously, for most parts of the world, I've had many of those gigantic paydays, but they've been consistent and they've been varied.



Varied in the sense that there are completely different kinds of investments and endeavors, but consistent in that, I get one every couple of years.



**Tim Ferriss: **I just want to interject for a second, which would seem to suggest that there are principles guiding your approaches or some—



**Naval Ravikant: **Absolutely.



**Tim Ferriss: **Systematic approach. Therefore, you're not relying on winning the Powerball lottery or that equivalent.



**Naval Ravikant: **No, not at all. No, there's no lottery here to win. The lottery is for losers. Lotteries are just attacks on people who can't do math. Your get-rich-quick schemes are just other people getting rich off of you. There are no shortcuts. So what I'm doing is I am taking my specific knowledge, which is my ability to understand deeply technical concepts and communicate them to the rest of the world, to be an interface between great programmers and developers and designers and the capital markets and consumers.



And using that to put myself in a position where then I can identify great trends as they're emerging, invest in those companies or help start those companies, own equity in those things, help bring them to market, help do the strategy and how to navigate the worlds of fundraising and exiting and recruiting and company building and cultures and technology development and all that, and have a brand around it.



And I used that to kind of make money. And that is just one of several ways. I've also done it by investing early on in public markets and cryptocurrencies and starting funds and all kinds of things. It's funny I don't really follow my own principles anymore. Like the, for example, the whole podcast thing and the whole Twitter thing, even though I've got reasonably good brands and followers, and those I'm not monetizing them at all.



I'm not charging anybody for anything because I'm not trying to make money anymore. To me, that making money is like, you become the kind of person that makes money and you put yourself in long-term situations where you're always going to make money. So I have the brand and I have deep relationships with a dozen people who I know, and I trust that I can do business with, for the rest of my life.



And they're very high integrity people. They're very capable people and just makes it easy to do things. So I've set up that infrastructure. Now, the money just kind of makes itself as I go about my life. I don't want to have to work hard. I don't want to have to roll out of bed at a certain time. I don't want to have to answer to somebody. So I optimize for independence and freedom.



I could have made a lot more money by raising a huge fund or joining a big VC firm early on, or being an executive. One of the massive companies in Silicon Valley early on, but I always optimize for independence. I'm lazy. I wake up, at seven, eight, nine, 10:00 a.m. I go to sleep at two, 3:00 a.m. You know, I don't work a lot of days. Some days I work morning to night, but it's just based on whatever I'm curious about.



I never want to have to answer to a boss. No one's ever going to tell me what to do. I don't want to order people around. I don't want to have someone reporting to me and kind of asking me all the time what to do. I want peer relationships. I want to flow. I want to be able to do business or walking in a forest, talking on a cell phone, or sitting in a meeting or in front of a computer, or I want to be on a beach if I don't feel like it.



The ideal would be to make money with your mind, not with your time. So if I can just make one good decision a year, and that makes me all the money that I need for that year, then that's perfect. And that's the way it should be, because we're living in an age of infinite leverage and your judgment just gets multiplied through this massive force multiplier through code, capital, community, labor, what have you.



So if you're smart and you kind of know what you're doing, you don't need to work hard. Working hard is the last least important thing. You have to pay your dues. You have to put in all the iterations, 10,000 iterations, not 10,000 hours, to figure out what to do and how to do it well. But once, you know, you don't have to put in the time anymore. It's your judgment.



And the judgment comes from clear thinking. The clear thinking comes from having time to reflect and to pursue your genuine intellectual curiosity. And you'll see that a lot of the great investors, for example, just sit around reading most of the time, or Warren Buffett famously plays a lot of bridge. Obviously not everyone can be just an investor, although that is becoming more and more democratized.



And I've picked something that suits my temperament and particular capabilities, but there's lots and lots of ways to make money if you apply your mind to it. So I don't work to make money. I mean, if I make so much money that I'm donating hospital wings and universities and all that stuff, I overshot. I'm not trying to have some influence on the world through money. Ironically, I have more influence over the world through podcasts like this.



And so making more money doesn't change my life. It doesn't change the world as much as I could by doing other things. So there's not much incentive for me to make money anymore. Other than just this practicing my craft.



**Tim Ferriss: **Well, let's talk about a few of your missives. Missives is probably not the word.



**Naval Ravikant: **Yeah. I'm not telling anybody to do anything. I'm not trying to persuade anyone of anything. So if people don't like it some people get triggered on Twitter and they start arguing, it's like, just leave. Just don't listen to it.



**Tim Ferriss: **Well, this would be great. The one I'm going to read would be a great one for people to get really upset about. Or I would find it comical to look at the comments of people are upset, but the line is this: Imagine how effective you would be if you weren't anxious all the time.



Why did you put this out? And have you seen highly anxious people become people who experienced very little anxiety? Is that something you've seen, but first, why did you put this up? What was behind it? And then have you seen anxious people become largely, I guess an anxious or non-anxious people.



**Naval Ravikant: **Yeah. Most of my tweets are not very deliberate or thought through. What's happening is I've been thinking about some concept for months, years, whatever it's been percolating. And then all of a sudden it'll come to me. It's sort of like one pithy sentence where I'm like, oh, this is how I will remember this thing. This is how I can distill this down into a pointer for myself, so that when I need to make decisions, I can retrieve that whole line of reasoning.



And so where this comes from is basically everybody, after a certain age, I am taking responsibility for my own happiness and peace and quality of life. And one of the things you learn after you make money is that money doesn't make you happier. It takes care of your money problems, but it's not necessarily going to put you in a place where you're in some kind of bliss all the time.



In fact, there's nothing out there that will make you happy forever. So you sort of have to take responsibility for guiding yourself in such a way that your mental state ends up where you want it. And so I've been working on my mental state and I have—working is a big word. I don't even want to say I've been working on it, but I would say my mental state has gotten to a place which is much better than it used to be.



And people will often say, "Well I don't want to do that because it'll take away my ambition. I want to succeed right now." And so I've thought about that a fair bit. And is that true or not? Well, it certainly, for me in the last few years, since I've become calmer, my effectiveness has gone through the roof and I've been more successful, but it's hard to disambiguate that from, well, also, maybe you just later in your career, you're in a better position for it and that's a valid criticism.



So one of the things I've been trying to figure out is like, would I have been as successful and it's hard to do the counterfactual obviously if I wasn't as anxious, because anxiety comes from fear and it's also a motivator. It makes you get off your butt. And one of the ways to make the anxiety go away, at least until the next piece of anxiety comes along, is to go do something about it.



So what is the role of anxiety? Well, firstly, I noted that pretty much everybody's anxious all the time. It's a rare human being who isn't anxious and it makes sense. We're alpha predators. We took over this earth and domesticated or killed all the other animals. And we did that by being the most paranoid, the most fearful, the most angry predators this world has ever seen.



So anxiety is built into the core of who we are. In fact, you could argue that all the mind does all day long is fear-based scenario planning for survival, and then maybe a little bit of green for replication. So anxiety is at the core level of who we are, but certainly some people are more anxious than others. There's no question. And some people seem to get much calmer about it.



So which is more useful for effectiveness? So assuming that your goal is your motivation is intrinsic. You're doing the thing because you love it or because you really want it, and you can separate that motivation from anxiety. Then I think you can take on certain superpowers. And we kind of all intrinsically know this. If you look at Samurai warriors, Miyamoto Musashi is in a duel with somebody else, you know that the person who is calmer is going to win.



In all those movies, it's the one who's incredibly still then swipes with a sword incredibly quickly, and is then still again, that's the winner—the one who has a zen sense of mind. Similarly in *The Terminator* movies, part of the reason you fear the Terminator is because he's a robot. He's unstoppable, he's implacable. You can't argue with him. You can't communicate with him. You can't make him slow down.



And he has no remorse. He just keeps coming. Or in that old Clint Eastwood movie *Unforgiven*. The guy who wins the gunfight is the one who doesn't flinch. He's just keeping his cool while he's loading his gun and shooting. He's not like all over the place running around. So I just think we waste so much energy through anxiety that if you can be calm and still go about your business, it's a superpower.



And I realized this myself recently, where I was in a conflict situation, business. It was a high conflict situation. It was unfortunate. We, I think we've solved it. But as I went through this high conflict situation, I'd been through one like it years before where I was much more anxious. And I remember that time period. And I remember how much I was sweating it and how nervous I was and how I went through bouts of fear and anger and how it kind of worked up I was the entire time, intense and didn't get much sleep.



But this time I was incredibly calm and I was almost enjoying it because it was like practicing my craft. Now, of course it's easy to do now because I have more money. But at the same time, it just didn't bother me. It was just very mechanical. And because of that, I can be very effective about it and it can be effective about it while doing lots and lots of other things. My mind wasn't constantly spinning in a whirlpool taking on 10 different problems and just fear-based scenario planning all the time.



Most of these things were never going to happen. So I do believe that being calm and still going about your business is the superpower. Now yes, if anxiety is your only motivator, then you have a problem. But I would argue the pure motivations don't come out of anxiety.



**Tim Ferriss: **So let's talk about attribution here. To what would you attribute the, I know this, that it's difficult to isolate variables, et cetera, but if let's just say like you have a family, so let's just say one of your kids comes to you is like, "Dad, I'm suffering from a lot of anxiety. What should I do?"



Or you observe it and you want to help your kid out. What types of recommendations would you make? Or might you make? Another question if you prefer it is what has helped you to go from the whirlpool experience of anxiety in high conflict experience, round one versus calm Naval, and high conflict experience round two?



**Naval Ravikant: **Yeah. It's really hard to separate all the pieces out. I mean, it comes from a combination of a philosophy, yoga meditation, and getting older, having kids. Like you, I've had some psychedelic experiences, but those are very far back in the past, just a distant memory at this point. But I would say the number one thing that has been very, very important for me is meditation.



And it's a stupid thing to say, because so trite, everybody just says it now. But when I say meditation, I don't mean sitting there and watching your breath or chanting a mantra. I mean, self-examination and meditation is a great way to do that self-therapy. It's sitting there with your thoughts. So anxiety, this pervasive nonspecific anxiety where we're just constantly on edge about everything, that comes from an unexamined life. I think it was Socrates who said, "An unexamined life is not worth living." I forget who said that quote—



**Tim Ferriss: **Something like that.



**Naval Ravikant: **But it's—



**Tim Ferriss: **Aristotle, Socrates—



**Naval Ravikant: **One of those smart philosopher types, but it's correct. It's your unexamined life that is causing the problems. And you can examine it in multiple ways. You can examine it through you can have some crazy mushroom trip where it all comes out one night. You could do a lot of meditation sitting there with yourself and letting your mind run crazy.



And then seeing what's actually in your mind that your mind wants to tell you, and have you listened to, and have you resolved that is unresolved. It could be through therapy. It could be through reading lots of philosophy and reflection and long walks. So there's many, many ways to tackle it, but it's that spending the time with yourself to examine why are you having these thoughts?



Think about it this way. We spend so much time in our relationships. Our relationships with our wives, our relationship with our colleagues, our relationships to our business partners, our relationship with our friends, the most important relationship you have is with yourself. It's with this voice in your head that is constantly rattling every waking hour, it's this crazy roommate living inside your mind who's always chattering, always chattering, never shuts up and you can't control these thoughts.



They just come up out of you don't even know where, and those quality of your thoughts, those conversations you're having in your head all the time. That is your world. That is the world you live in. That's the worldview you have. That's a lens you see through, and that's going to determine the quality of your life more than anything else.



And if you want to see what the quality of your life actually is, put down the drink, put down the computer, put down the smartphone, put down the book, put down the headphones, just sit by yourself, doing nothing. And then you will know what the quality of your life actually is because that's what you're always running away from.



That's why people, when they try to meditate they sit down, "I hate it. I can't sit still." Why? Because your mind is eating you alive. Your life is unexamined. Your mind is running in loops over things that it has not resolved. And because they're not resolved when you run around your normal life. It's not that those problems have gone away. It's that they're just there, they're there, but they're provoking anxiety.



And what you think of as the anxiety that's kind of consuming you and you can't identify the source. That's just the tip of an iceberg poking out from underneath the water and underneath this giant pile of garbage of decisions that were made without too much thought of situations that you're in, that you haven't resolved, that you need to resolve, of problems that you have, or desires that you have that have gone unmet or unmanifested, or are being, or contradictions that you're living in a ways that you, which you feel trapped.



So proper meditation, proper examination should ruin the life that you're currently living. It should cause you to leave relationships. It should cause you to reestablish boundaries with family members and with colleagues. It should cause you to quit your job. It should cause you to change your eating patterns. It should cause you to spend more time with yourself.



It should cause it to change the books you read. It should cause us to change what your friends are. If it doesn't do that, it's not real examination. If it doesn't come attached with destruction of your current life, then you can't create the new life in which you will not have the anxiety.



**Tim Ferriss: **Or at least parts of it. Not necessarily whole cloth. So let's dive into meditation because as you mentioned, it's a term that is used a lot. And in the minds of most, it is represented by things that you just said, you do not do like the mantra-based meditation or following the breath. And you and I have meditated before.



I don't know if your approach is still similar, but it is quite a—I'd hate to talk about trite paradigm shift in a sense, at least in the way that I experienced it alongside you, at one point, which was literally doing nothing for extended periods of time. I don't know if that's still the case, but could you describe the practice a bit because it was such a burden lifted in a sense when the pass-fail is removed.



And the experience that I had after say a week of doing this twice a day, which is not necessarily what people would do in normal life, but was pretty profound. So could you describe the current practice, which may be different from what I experienced.



**Naval Ravikant: **Yeah. I actually have two different things that I do, and I almost hate calling it meditation because everyone has in their mind, a preconceived notion of what meditation is. Let's not even call it that. I would say that there are two self-examination practices that I do, and I don't even call them practices anymore because sometimes I do them because I feel like them and I enjoy them, or because it feels right.



And sometimes I don't because anything done routinely sort of becomes its own trap and is not going to get you anywhere. It just becomes like another spiritual high and other check box.



**Tim Ferriss: **Now is it fair though, to say that you're able to opt-in and out now because you had a certain front-loading period—



**Naval Ravikant: **Correct.



**Tim Ferriss:**—of doing it consistently.



**Naval Ravikant: **Actually I'll say the three different things that I do and I'll go through them. The first, I just read a lot of philosophy, especially at night time before I go to bed.



**Tim Ferriss: **Which ones? Schopenhauer, Maxims? Who are we talking about?



**Naval Ravikant: **Yes, Schopenhauer, Western philosophy is my current favorite, although I've definitely moved around in that one. Eastern philosophy, I'll read everything from Osho. I know he's discredited and been canceled, but fantastic—that makes me like him even more. Krishnamurti, I don't know, Kapil Gupta, Rupert Spira. I mean, it's all over the place. Anthony de Mello, he's fantastic actually.



If going to start with one book. Start with Anthony de Mello's *A Way to Love* or his book *Awareness*. They're both really good, but there's a ton of them. I basically read a lot of philosophers. Siddhartha, Vasistha's Yoga, Bhagavad Gita, Tao Te Ching. I'm always going through one of these books at any given time and usually rereading for inspiration.



And I'll read these at night. Usually, there'll be one or two things I'll catch on to, I'll reflect on it before I go to sleep. So that is a form of self-examination and it's not done because it's a formula it's done because I'm genuinely interested in these things. So it's not work to me, it's fun. The second thing that I do is which I've been doing for a long time now is just trying to be aware of my thoughts and not in a sit there and be like, "Oh, I'm going to be aware of my thoughts kind of way."



But just realizing that a lot of these thoughts that come up are unbidden I don't control them. It's not like I decided to have this thought. I don't even know what I'm saying to you right now. It's coming out of my mouth at the same time as I'm thinking it. So where is this coming from? Who is this person? What is this person saying? Is this true? Is it correct? Has it been correct in the past? Is he just being paranoid now? Is it being crazy? What are his underlying motivations? 



And I'm not even questioning so much, but more just kind of seeing it. And after a while, when you see it, you start seeing through your own BS, you start seeing how you're mainly just justifying whatever the heck you want to believe, because it's good for your survival. It's good for your replication, or it's good for your money, or it's going to get you late or any of these various things.



**Tim Ferriss: **And when you're doing that reflection is it sitting at a table, pen and paper? Is it—



**Naval Ravikant: **No.



**Tim Ferriss: **Half lotus with your eyes closed? What is—



**Naval Ravikant: **No, it's really just walking around. Just walking around. It's just life. Just if you say something to me, I'm always going to listen to it with a slightly critical filter, because you're external to me. Applying that same filter to my own thoughts, it gives me a level of peace and distance from them and the ability to see through my own BS, which I think makes my life better.



So I've just found that to be a useful way of life. But there are lots of times where I forget to do it. I get caught up in some emotion, some runaway train of thought, but usually these days I can catch myself and be like, "Oh, okay, I'm in that mindset again. And having that mode of reactions again," and when the mind sort of sees me chattering it quiets down a bit.



And like I said, is that back to that crazy roommate analogy, which I originally picked up from Michael Singer, by the way, he has a good book called *The Untethered Soul*. But the crazy roommate analogy, like you would eventually tell your roommate to shut up, or you would tell them to start justifying their claims, or you would at least at some level, you start dismissing them for just kind of rambling all the time and this fear of paranoid mode.



So I think just kind of viewing your thoughts as sort of these unbidden things that arise from within you, but aren't really necessarily the whole story and should be viewed with the same level of skepticism that you would apply to an outside observer. I think that framework is helpful. And if you find it to be true, then you'll find yourself doing it more often. If you find it not to be true, if you're like, "No, actually I choose these thoughts and I want to have them. And that's who I am. And this all makes sense to me."



Then you can stop viewing it with a critical eye that's up to you. But the last one is the one that I think people think of as more traditionally meditation, which is sitting down and meditating. And on that one, I learned from an Indian gentleman, same character you learn from, who had a very simple system and I just found it the most compelling form of meditation I've ever tried.
