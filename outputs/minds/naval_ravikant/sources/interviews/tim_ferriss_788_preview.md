**Tim Ferriss: **Brother Naval, Brother Aaron, nice to see you both. And Naval, would you like to kick us off, grab the reins, go to town?



**Naval Ravikant: **Aaron Stupple here, who I actually met, I think we met online, right?



**Aaron Stupple: **Yeah.



**Naval Ravikant: **We met online on various channels, Twitter, Airchat, and just talking about various things. He came out of the critical rationalism crowd, which is a group of thinkers that surround David Deutsch and his philosophy. And Aaron struck me as someone at first who I was like, this man is insane, but I realized in a good way. He's a very ground up, very principled thinker. And what I really liked about talking to Aaron, who came out of nowhere, is that he will take these philosophically sound positions that are very controversial and then he will just defend them indefatigably without tiring. He'll just keep going. He'll keep repeating himself if we need to. He'll explain it from 10 different angles, but he is very tied into the idea of using creativity to find answers to problems and to not using coercion.



And so he would end up in these rabbit holes where I would find myself having to, usually when I meet someone like that, I usually side with them, I learn from them, and I try to help preach that to the rest of the world. Here, it was a little bit the opposite. I found myself on the defensive. I found him too radical, too hard to take seriously. But as time went on, I actually realized he was right about a lot of things. It gave me that very uncomfortable feeling.



And so Aaron actually wrote a book called *The Sovereign Child*. He's been espousing a theory around Taking Children Seriously, which is an older philosophy, but he's, I would say, the best expositor of that philosophy. But he also had really great takes in everything from "Is AI going to end the world?" to "What do you do if you walk into an emergency room?" because he's a doctor, to "How to run a classroom," because I think he's also been a public school teacher. So I just found him a very compelling person to talk to, and I'm still honestly trying to digest a lot of what he has to say.



And I think some of it has seeped into my life and my family life and some of it still hasn't. So I'm here to challenge him and interrogate him and to reveal him to the rest of the world. I will say that this may end up being one of your most controversial episodes for two reasons. I think one is, it really attacks, at a core level, the entire system we have around how we view children and raise children. So it's really a big F you to the entire system, everything from schooling to parenting to child raising to how do you take care of the most precious thing in your life? And second, it's a bunch of dudes. It's a bunch of men standing around talking about this. I don't see the wives or the women. So you could just call this the bro parenting episode, right? This is a bunch of dads and potential dads talking about what is the best way to raise sovereign children? 



So let me just start off by maybe asking Aaron, give us a very quick background on yourself.



**Tim Ferriss: **And also mention how many kids you have, just so we underscore some bona fides.



**Naval Ravikant: **Zero. He actually has zero children.



**Aaron Stupple: **Zero children. It's all theoretical. I've got five kids, ages seven to one. And thanks so much for those kind words, Naval. I really appreciate that, and it's been so much fun talking with you and your cohort on Airchat and Twitter and elsewhere. I started off as a public school teacher coming out of college and spent five years doing that and was really kind of deep into the human nature and the experience of young people and formed some pretty strong ideas about human nature and children, and then converted that into medical school. And I've been a practicing physician now for the past 10 years, internal medicine.



And along the way, I got into one of our mutual heroes, David Deutsch, and his take on Karl Popper's philosophy. And within that, David Deutsch and his colleague, Sarah Fitz-Claridge, they both developed this theory on children and childhood called Taking Children Seriously. And I stumbled upon this right with the birth of our first child, and I thought, boy, this is pretty radical and pretty interesting. And after reading more about it and learning more about it, I was kind of faced with, do I apply this to my own kid? Because it's very different from the typical conventional view on parenting and what I had already been very comfortable with coming out of teaching.



And I did. The short story is that I did, my wife and I, she is very open-minded and was open to these ideas. And we found ourselves just doing this 100 percent, basically. And so we've got five kids now. We've been doing this for seven years. And it's remarkable. I've been into philosophy as an amateur since college, but this is the first time that was a really strong application of these ideas to my life. And I can't think of a more transformative day-to-day impactful, practical, applicable set of ideas than this set of ideas as applied to children.



**Naval Ravikant: **I will say, I've incorporated, maybe, call it 30 percent to 50 percent of what you're saying. I was already directionally inclined, but I've managed to incorporate some of it and my wife and I are open to more of the rest, although it's pretty radical. So let's get into it.



So just as an example, the philosophy that you're talking about, the Taking Children Seriously philosophy, which you lay out in *The Sovereign Child*, the book, you basically say the kids have no sleep schedules, you don't control what they eat, they have unrestricted screen time. I'm not even sure I have unrestricted screen time, but your kids have unrestricted screen time. You don't force them to go to school. You don't make them do chores. You don't have rules like "Don't hit each other." You try not to mediate sibling conflict. You don't force them to share things. They're not forced to say "Thank you" or obliged to say "Thank you" or even badgered to say "Thank you." There's no real punishment, there's no timeouts or withholding of things. There's no making them spend time with the grandparents or the extended family. You don't force them to brush their teeth. You don't make them sit at the dinner table, that's optional. So what are we talking about here? Do you have children or do you have roommates?



**Tim Ferriss: **Feral animals.



**Naval Ravikant: **Feral animals, exactly. So what is this all about? Where did this come from?



**Aaron Stupple: **The typical way of looking at parenting is the question of what do you allow and what do you disallow? And almost every view I'm parenting is a discussion of, well, we allow this, but we don't allow that, and these are the methods that we use to enforce these limitations and these are the justifications that we have for enforcing these limitations. And what my wife and I do is we just step away from that question altogether and instead view problems as they arise and try to find solutions to those problems rather than appealing to rules. The way we interact with our friends and our family, the adults in our lives, we don't apply rules to people. If we're not crazy about what we're having for dinner, we don't say, "Okay, this is the rule for dinner time." We instead try to come up with something that works for everybody. And so you could just start with sleep, you could start with brushing teeth or eating food. The idea is to let kids choose what is interesting or appealing to them and then deal with problems as they arise.



**Naval Ravikant: **But couldn't every parent say, "Well, I try to do that. I try to convince them that broccoli is good and salmon is good and they should eat their broccoli and salmon, then they get dessert. And so I try to convince them to do that, but they don't know any better." And so I always try to negotiate with them, but after a while, you sort of give up because you realize they're just going to eat chocolate until they explode. And so I have to cut that off and say, "No. No more ice cream. And you're going to eat your salmon, your broccoli, and then you can have your ice cream." And then there's a little bit of fighting and whining, and then eventually they just get used to it. So what's wrong with that? I tried too, I tried to negotiate with them.



**Aaron Stupple: **The thing that's wrong with it is that every time you force your child to do something, you inevitably set yourself up as an adversary to your kid. So if you're trying to get them to eat broccoli, you are introducing a difficulty in their life around food. And food is something that is crucial to a person's engagement with the world, a young person, and you want them to learn about broccoli for broccoli's sake. If broccoli is good for you, you want them to understand broccoli for its own properties. If chocolate is bad for you, if chocolate makes you feel bad, then you want them to understand that as mediated by themselves, not because you're introducing yourself into that thing.



So you don't want them to avoid chocolate because they're afraid of Dad. You don't want them to eat broccoli because Dad makes you eat broccoli at the dinner table and you can't go up and do what you want to do because you've got to appease Dad. If broccoli is really important, then it's really important that broccoli is not confused. If eating well is really important, then it's really important that eating is not confused by what your parents' expectations are.



**Tim Ferriss: **Let me just zoom out for a minute. So if we look at, say David Deutsch and his collaborator on Taking Children Seriously, and for people who want more on David Deutsch, we might have some mentions and sidebars, but Naval and I did an episode with David. Why did they land on the tenets that they did for Taking Children Seriously? And can we know that their approach is right? In other words, is there any way to even know that this is a good approach to parenting?



**Aaron Stupple: **So that's perfect. It's about knowing, right? And there's different theories about, how do we know when we know something, right? We call this epistemology, the theory of knowledge. And Deutsch's perspective on this is that humans are uniquely knowledge creators. And the thing about children that's similar to adults is that they're both knowledge creators in the same way. And the role of the parent is to facilitate the child as a burgeoning knowledge creator and not to foil that process. And things that foil that process of knowledge creation and discovery are authorities that arbitrarily thwart you when you're trying to learn about something.



And so that's how they hit on this originally. Sarah Fitz-Claridge was just very interested in non-coercion and raising children with zero coercion. She just had that in her mind as a parent and she kind of searched around for schools of parenting that had zero coercion, that had no enforcement of rules. And the person that she aligned with was David Deutsch who brought this epistemological perspective. And his whole argument is that the problem with coercion is that it blocks knowledge growth and your duty as a parent is to facilitate and foster knowledge growth. And that's, I would say, one way of describing the entire premise.



**Naval Ravikant: **And I think underneath, deep down, we all kind of know that there's this contradiction between, okay, we teach kids, go to school, obey the rules, do what we say, you don't know yet, you're not ready, you're not ready, you're not ready. And then all of a sudden they go to college and there's a complete flip. Like, "Now you're free. Now you get to learn how to operate in the real world. You've got to think for yourself. Why can't you think for yourself?" And this whole time you've domesticated them almost like animals so that they can function in normal society, you train them to eat, you train them to go to the bathroom, you train them to go to sleep, you train them to listen to the teacher, and then all of a sudden they're supposed to be independent thinkers and creators and knowledge generators.



And I think all of us have a story of how some very important parts of our life are all about undoing all the things we're taught and discovering for ourselves. And it could be learning how to learn instead of being forced to learn, learning what to learn instead of the set of subjects we were given in school. It could be finally figuring out proper diet and nutrition, which turns out to be the opposite of what we were taught, the FDA food pyramid is still upside down, starts with grains and you get your bread and get your rice, and then it kind of goes down from there and meat is at the bottom. So, a lot of it is about undoing what we learned. And a lot of us also have the stories.



I personally have the story when I first went to college, I ate the worst food you could imagine. I just ate complete garbage, I played a ton of games, it's mostly what I did, spent most of my time in the computer lab playing video games. And I was just so enamored with the freedom, not that my mother was all that restrictive in the first place, but I just didn't have the abundance of food and screen time that I suddenly did in school. And I think even as an adult, we're all still dealing with social media addiction, we're all still dealing with eating more sugar than we want to, we're all still dealing with trying to figure out the proper diet, we're all still trying to be disciplined enough to exercise, we're all still trying not to doom scroll all the time. So there's a learning process. And so the question is, when do you start that learning process?



And so I think we have this distinction that kids below a certain age, they're like somewhere between, this is going to be controversial, but somewhere between animals and slaves and ignoramuses, they're like animals that you need to teach them basic things so it sticks. Like you teach a dog, you teach the kid what to eat, when to eat, how to eat, when to go to the bathroom, and then they're a little bit of a slave because we can order them around. We're physically larger than them, even if we're not physically overpowering them. Every missive is backed up with a threat of, "Or what else?" Well, I'll take it away from you, right?



It's like with the government. The government says, "I'm going to write you a ticket for jaywalking." What that really means is I'll put you in jail if you jaywalk, because everything is backed up at the end of the day with the ability to throw you in jail. The same way everything you say as a parent is backed up with the ability of force. And without that, it wouldn't exist. And then finally, we just assume that the kids are not capable of learning certain things fast enough. They have to brush their teeth, they have to not eat ice cream because it might cause irreparable damage by the time they're old enough. But I think all of these are valid concerns and they're worth tackling, and we can go more into them, but I've got a whole list of controversial things to go through with you.



**Tim Ferriss: **Okay, so I'm going to be the guy in the sidecar chiming in. Do we have any more than one case study of people who have applied this to children for more than seven years? Like 20 years? 25 years? Just because I don't personally know anyone who has parented their children this way. And so, I'm wondering if we have a sample set of kids who've been raised over 15, 20+ years using these methods and how they turned out.



**Aaron Stupple: **I'm not familiar with a set. I know some folks, but I don't want to out them individually. But I'll even attack the premise of the question. Well, I'd say this is relevant that when we think about kids and what is a good way to parent, we think in empirical terms and in terms of outcomes and research and scientific tests and sociology and things like that. But there's a huge problem when you're trying to answer what is essentially a moral question, trying to answer it scientifically and from a research base or an outcomes-based basis.



So a comparison would be feminism, right? The arguments for women's liberation were not outcomes-based arguments. And there were people who were saying that, "You know what? If we allow women to control their own lives, then they're going to be worse off, they're going to be depressed, all sorts of terrible things are going to happen." And you can imagine the people who were arguing against feminism in terms of outcomes could create all sorts of arguments about what those outcomes would be. And women arguing in favor or people arguing in favor of feminism, in favor of women's liberation, would say, "I don't care what the outcomes are. I want to control my own life. I'm a full status person and I am morally deserving to make choices and decisions about my life." And the same goes for all minority issues and human liberation movements is that they're moral arguments, they're not scientific arguments. And it's kind of funny — 



**Naval Ravikant: **Yeah. In fact if you ask most people like, "Hey, when you were young, do you wish your parents had controlled you more or less?" I think most people's complaint would be that, "My parents were too controlling," right?



**Tim Ferriss: **Well, are we dealing with some survivorship bias where you're asking very smart people who have done well what they would prefer, then maybe. You're not asking people in jail the same question. Now, look, I want to explore the moral side of things, but I'm going to just state my maybe placeholder objection that if we frame it as a moral argument, then we take certain lines of questioning off the table. I will just say my interest in asking that question is, what does it refer to? One of you guys is going to know, the Lindy effect, just like the durability of things over time. I just haven't seen much of this, so I'm curious about it — 



**Naval Ravikant: **Actually, there is some Lindy evidence. There's some Lindy evidence. Firstly, keep in mind that historically children hit puberty age of eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, and they were adults at that point. They were out conquering nations and having children. And it's only recently that we moved it up to 18 and a lot of struggle for teenagehood is trying to control an adult as if they're a child. And so, you can already see that it happens at a certain age.



Then secondly, it's not an all or nothing thing, and Aaron lays this out in his book, which is basically about where can you start? So for example, I'll say with my children, my children are closer to somewhere between homeschooled and unschooled and they wake up when they want and they sleep relatively when they want and they do have a lot more permissiveness around eating and screen time. The amount of screen time they spend is horrific. I think one of my kids was showing me the other day, he did eight hours of screen time that day, which I think most parents would have a fit. In one day, eight hours of screen time, that's all he did. So they already have a high level of permissiveness. And I can just say for me personally that they seem pretty well-developed, they're happy, they're healthy, they're pretty intelligent, and they seem to do well relative to their peers. They seem to have less hangups than I think the average kid would and they have a lot more freedom.



But the good news is you don't have to do this all or nothing. I said all or nothing to be provocative because Aaron's a believer, he's all the way, but you can start in one area. And so what's an example of an area where you could start, Aaron? The beauty of truth is you don't have to rely on somebody's study, because people who do studies these days, we know how corrupted they are. So we know there's a whole class of people who show up on Twitter to say, "Source?" As if that's killing your argument. Harvard didn't bless this. Well, Harvard wants mandatory education at Harvard, right? So I can't listen to them. They want to indoctrinate my child. So — 



**Tim Ferriss: **Let me turn around the question on you, Naval, just for a second. Because you mentioned early on you're 30 percent to 50 percent incorporated. So what did you incorporate first?



**Naval Ravikant: **Yeah, I basically retreated heavily back. And what I retreated on was first I'm not very authoritarian with the kids. I never have been. So if they're around me and they want to eat junk food, I just hand them the junk food and then I'll leave the room. I'm not that responsible.



**Tim Ferriss: **That's Mom's problem.



**Naval Ravikant: **Yeah, exactly. Mom and other caretakers might be more restrictive, but I tend not to be, especially around food, especially when I know what a bad job I personally do with food. I'm also not that restrictive with screen time. I basically just after 6:00 p.m., they get unlimited screen time. Pretty much, and I don't force them to go to school. They're a combination of homeschooled and unschooled. Where I would say I am restrictive is I probably interfere a lot if they're fighting, if they're hitting at each other. I'm kind of pushy about, "Let's go, let's go. Let's hurry up. We're late. Get in the car," that kind of thing.



Definitely the one place where I have a big bugaboo, I think they can get over eating badly as kids. Young bodies are very resilient and it takes a lifetime to figure out how to eat well. And I think they can get over even socialization and emotional hangups and interpersonal conflict. All that stuff has to be handled on its own and they have to figure it out. The two places where I probably interfere a lot is one is I insist on math and reading. You've got to do your math and you've got to do your reading. If you do your math and reading, then you're a free individual. Until then, you're a little slave and you don't get to do what you want. So I'm pretty tough there. And the other one is if one of them is hitting the other, then that to me is a boundary that you don't cross and I tend to get emotional and tend to interfere. So those are probably the two places where I'm most restrictive.



But I would say that our kids are closer to wild animals than properly raised children. But I will say, I think most kids these days that I run into, most of their friends who are kind of "normally raised," I wouldn't trade places. Our family has a lot more freedom. We get along great with our kids. They're very intelligent, they're very independent, they're very capable, and they seem to be as well or better adjusted than any of their peers. Not to put their peers down, but I have noticed that all of their peers tend to have a way of getting attention from adults and violating the rules. And that could be anything from, "I'm having an allergic reaction" to "I threw up" to "I'm having a meltdown" to whatever. And these are all attention-seeking behavior to control adults who are normally not controllable. And our kids seem to have a lot less of that. Maybe it's just anecdotal.



**Aaron Stupple: **Yeah, I would say the same thing. Our kids are not wild. In fact, they do what we ask them to do. They're very responsive. When my wife asks them to do something, they don't have a knee-jerk defensiveness, and they're not trying to game us as adversaries or gatekeepers. It's a very authentic interaction and they're very polite. They say "please" and "thank you" to each other. They bang up against each other so frequently without us trying to intervene that they understand each other's boundaries. They're very conscientious. Obviously, it's a small sample size and there's plenty of other reasons why that might be the case. But I would say a lot of people object to removing rules and say that it's impossible, a kid will absolutely fall apart. And a few examples of kids not falling apart, I think, does demonstrate that it's possible. It's possible that removing rules can result in a very orderly, structured, and I would say polite kind of rule following way of being. 



**Naval Ravikant: **Yeah. I often say that I would rather that my kids be disobedient and free and uneducated than that they're educated and obedient because you can always educate yourself, and most of us who know anything have become self-learners over time. And learning is always a moving target. But that independent thinking, that independent streak, you can't get back. Everyone I know who is successful in life has a strong, independent streak, no exceptions.



**Tim Ferriss: **So question, Aaron, you said rule-following, but this is also a freedom-maximizing parenting philosophy. You also mentioned that if your wife asks for something, the kids will often, for lack of a better term, comply. So is the teaching then coming from modeling rather than rules? That's why they say "please" and "thank you?" It's not a request, it's something that you are demonstrating and therefore they're following? Or are you explaining the importance of those things and therefore they end up adopting those behaviors?



**Aaron Stupple: **We explain when we can, but with little kids explaining in words rarely works. And so I think a helpful distinction is that it's not that all rules are bad, the rules of chess, the rules of baseball are great. What's great about rules is when you can opt out of them and adults can opt out of almost any set of rules. Rules that adults can't opt out of are called laws and laws are very different from rules. 



**Tim Ferriss: **You can opt out of those too. There are just severe consequences.



**Aaron Stupple: **Right? Well, you can stay home, right? A man's home is his castle. You can avoid the laws of the road, the rules of the road, and just not drive a car. You can ride a bike, you can walk. But a typical kid cannot escape, cannot opt out of the rule of brushing their teeth, for example. When teeth brushing time comes around, Mom or Dad will hunt them down and find them and make them brush their teeth. And so that's not really a rule in the same sense of the rules of chess, where if you want to say, let's play with different pieces, let's change the way the pieces move, you can adopt those rules or say, "I don't want to play chess. I want to go do something else." So rules are great and I'm actually a huge fan of rules. In fact, I'm such a fan of rules that I don't want to contaminate rules with this kind of fake or phony set of rules, which are really, they're not even laws. They are arbitrary autocratic impositions on a child's life.



And so brushing teeth, forcing a kid to brush their teeth, I think, is a disaster. People usually think that you have to force rules on kids. It's a necessary evil. You just have to. Nobody wants to be a hard-ass, but when push comes to shove, they just have to brush their teeth because kids don't know about cavities, a three-year-old doesn't understand the concept. And for their own good, they would be upset with me later in life if they have cavities and they said, "Dad didn't make me brush my teeth and now I've got awful teeth." They would be rightfully, justifiably upset with me.



And so what do you do in that circumstance? The typical thinking is that, well, it's a necessary evil. You just have to make them brush their teeth. But the truth is, and this is getting to the epistemology, is that a kid that's not brushing their teeth, really that's a problem. And the question is, are there ways to solve this problem that don't involve me forcing myself on them, forcing the rule on them? And with any problem, there's multiple solutions and brushing teeth is a great example.



What my wife and I do is we try to explore and understand what is the nature of this problem? And so maybe the kid isn't brushing their teeth because they don't like the taste of the toothpaste or they don't like the feel of the toothbrush. Or my wife and I'll brush our teeth and blow our breath in each other's face and kind of swoon at how good our breath smells afterward, and then they want to do that. They want to have good smelling breath. They want to play the breath smelling game. We'll take them to the store and we go to the toothpaste aisle and let them pick out the *Paw Patrol* toothpaste and the unicorn toothpaste, and they get their own toothpaste.



**Tim Ferriss: **Man, I need to go shopping with you. That sounds great.



**Aaron Stupple: **Right? And then that becomes a whole fun thing. Like, "Hey, let's go to the store and you're going to be in charge and let's go to the toothpaste aisle and you pick out all your stuff." And today is amazing, there's different flavors of mouthwash, there's everything. So you explore the space of these solutions and you never know when you can find one.



**Naval Ravikant: **Yeah. Can I give you my own anecdotes on this that are funny?



**Aaron Stupple: **Yeah, go for it.



**Naval Ravikant: **So with my older son, I actually managed to explain to him the germ theory of disease. We watch YouTube videos on little germs eating things and I convinced him that germs are going to eat his teeth if he doesn't brush them. So he brushes them. My daughter, she's really young, she just sees me flossing all the time, she loves playing with floss. It's that simple. So, each one has their own mechanism, how to figure out. My middle son, he likes the, I think it's a Spider-Man toothbrush, so it's a very particular toothbrush he likes. So he plays with that. So there's a different solution for each one. But it takes time, it takes creativity, it takes problem solving, and you can't get exactly what you want when you want it — 



**Aaron Stupple: **Well, it also takes another thing is for them to be open to you, Naval. Right? If you were a rule enforcer, they want to keep like, "Oh, shit, it's toothbrushing time," right? Last thing I want to do is deal with Dad at toothbrushing time. Whereas if you're never that enforcer, then the kid is much more like, "Oh, what are you doing with the floss? What kind of toothpaste is that?" They're much more interested in emulating and following the modeling when you are not this arbitrary enforcer. 



**Naval Ravikant: **I have a rule for myself, which I do bust my kids occasionally, which I know you don't bust your kids, but I do occasionally bust my kids. But if they come to me with something that they did innocently, that they didn't think was wrong, but it's wrong, I never bust them because I don't want to create that feeling in them, like, don't go to Dad. So at least I'm not fully enlightened here, but I'm headed in the direction. But let's go to some of the harder ones. Let's talk about eating or screen time. Those are the tough ones. 




Tim Ferriss: Can I actually, I'm going to go mezzo zoom in? We're going to get to those. But I want to just mention, so Aaron, this is my first time having this conversation with either of you about this approach to parenting. And what I'd like about it is that there's an examination of the problem, right? We're not jumping to solutions because often, the problem is the way we're looking at the problem in the first place. But I imagine for a lot of people listening, they're like, "Okay. So you have a bespoke Savile Row-tailored solution to every kid. That sounds fucking exhausting." When if the kid's refusing to wear gloves and it's freezing outside, "Just put on your fucking gloves because I tell you to put them on." And I'm also, I guess as a segue from that, coming back to this creativity over coercion. When I think of creativity, I actually think of the power of constraints, not the complete lack of constraints. That's my personal experience and the experience of a lot of people I interview. So how do you reconcile these things or think about any of those?



**Aaron Stupple: **All right. Let me do the gloves first and then the constraints second.



**Tim Ferriss: **Yeah.



**Aaron Stupple: **So yes, it's a lot of work when the kid wants to go outside and doesn't want to wear their mittens, right? And you're going to be dealing with a kid melting down because their hands are cold and a totally irrational, seeming three-year-old screaming. But also, won't put the mittens on even when their hands are cold. And that's a nightmare and I'm not pretending that that's not a nightmare. But the investment up front pays off in the long run. Because once a kid understands what mittens are for and has no confusion about mittens are because Mom makes me put the mittens on, right? "Mittens are because cold hands suck and I'll wear my mittens."



Once a kid understands that, the mitten problem is solved and you never have to lecture them about getting ready and what they wear. And it's that over and over and over again. The first times through, it is more work. There's no question about it. Exploring the problem, trying to understand. My daughter brushes her teeth like, boom. My son too. Pretty much the three older kids brush their teeth just on their own. Once a problem gets solved to the kid's own understanding, it's solved for the rest of their life. 



**Naval Ravikant: **It's also not part of an explanatory framework that you can build upon. Rules don't connect to each other. The only way rules connect to each other is Dad or Mom says so. Whereas knowledge, it's a framework of understanding. So once you understand you're brushing your teeth because of germs, then you also understand why you should shower, and why you should use soap, and why you should change your underwear, and all those things.



**Aaron Stupple: **Why you take medicine, why you cover your mouth when you cough.



**Naval Ravikant: **Yeah. Exactly.



**Aaron Stupple: **Exactly. It all builds. 



**Naval Ravikant: **Right. They all go together. And so the sooner you can teach your kids that knowledge, the better. But there's an age, I would argue with Aaron. Like there's a certain age which it just doesn't register.



**Aaron Stupple: **No. Because the other part of it is that you are the guide, right? Dad is someone who helps me. Dad is never someone who busts my balls. Dad is never an adversary. Dad is always a guide and a participant in this knowledge accumulation process. And he helps give me the knowledge that helps me solve my problems and avoid getting sick or avoid getting a sunburn or bug bites or whatever it is. So you have a — it not only builds on the knowledge itself, but the relationship with your parents gets stronger. And that's why I'm saying, when we ask our kids to do something, they trust us. They know that we have their best interests at heart. Not simply because we tell them, but because they see it and experience it. So you have a trusted guide who you understand that we're all in this project together of figuring out life and avoiding suffering and pursuing interest and pursuing joy and developing passions.



**Naval Ravikant: **There was an old book called *The Scientist in the Crib*. The title is so good that I think the book is very popular because everyone wants to view their child as a little scientist. Even though they treat them like the convict in the crib, "You do exactly what I say when I tell you to." But I think there's a struggle. People say, "Well, I don't want to be my kid's best friend. They have friends, I have to be a parent." And then, they think through, "Well, what does that mean to be a parent?" And the reality is I think most people would've preferred more independence when they were kids. So why not start trying to give it to your kids and doing the explanation? But the explanations are hard. I mean, it takes a lot of upfront work. I will grant that.



**Tim Ferriss: **Let me ask you this, Naval. Do you think people, in retrospect — well, for instance, coercion versus non-coercion. There isn't really a universe in which most people would find a positive connotation with coercion, right?



**Naval Ravikant: **Sure. Yeah.



**Tim Ferriss: **So if someone says functional medicine, they don't want to go to a non-functional doctor, right?



**Naval Ravikant: **Right.



**Tim Ferriss: **Well, it's a bit of a — not a semantic trick, but you can't really reasonably take the opposite position. So I'm wondering, do you think that most people who say, "I wish I had more freedom when I was a kid," are recalling completely enough or accurately enough to make that judgment?



**Naval Ravikant: **There's certain things where you can argue the opposite. So I'll take the other side for a moment to challenge Aaron's philosophy. I think brain plasticity is a thing. If you don't learn your math or your music or your languages when you're young, it's a lot harder to learn than when you're older and they're building blocks. So my kid may be interested in some physics thing like, "Oh, why is the sunlight going this way?" Or, "Why is it a quarter moon instead of a half moon?" And I start trying to explain it. But if he doesn't have the basics in geometry or math because he skipped all of that, then he'll lose interest before I can get him interested enough to figure out the math. If you're trying to figure out basic math when you're 19, it's pretty late in the game. You're going to have a hard time.



Same thing with literacy and reading. If you never learn how to put words together and read. Then when you finally are interested and I point you to the book, you can't read it. And you're not going to climb that hill from zero to figure it out. So I'm stuck in that one. I think I would call it literacy, numeracy, and computer literacy are the three things that I really want my kids to have. And those three, to me, are foundational building blocks. And everything else, they can learn on their own interest and in their own time. Yeah.



**Tim Ferriss: **So Aaron, are there any areas, non-negotiables, like Naval's that he mentioned perhaps, these fundamental building blocks that you have reserved outside the scope of *The Sovereign Child*? 



**Naval Ravikant: **And by the way, there's a physical equivalence too. So I think the three that people fall down on, if I may, well, okay, there's actually a lot. But there's brain plasticity around learning. There's habits. Habits are a big thing. There's social cues around not hitting people or getting into fights and knowing how to socialize. There's body plasticity. I ate poorly when I was a kid. So therefore, those bad habits follow me forever and my body remembers all the damage that I did to it. There's something about the number of fat cells. Whenever it goes down, the size can go down. I don't know how true that is. So there's all these things that are viewed as irreversible. And it gets all the way to the most extreme of the kid runs in the street and gets hit by a car, because you were too permissive as a parent. So there's a litany of fears. But I think there is a specific thing around these things that you have to learn when you're young, because you can't change when you're older or you can't learn them when you're older.



**Aaron Stupple: **So a bunch of points to this. First, let's say that's true. There's these non-negotiable things. That still raises the question of how, how do you get your kids to learn these things? If math is essential, you could put a gun to your kid's head and say, "You're learning math." And so we could recognize that that would be a bad idea. 



**Naval Ravikant: **Wait. I've got to try — no, never mind.



**Aaron Stupple: **Oh, I never thought of that. 



**Naval Ravikant: **Creative problem solving, here it is. Bro problem solving — 



**Aaron Stupple: **Jordan Peterson has a popular thing where he's saying that you don't let your kid behave in a way that makes you not like them. And boy, that really sounds important. But how do you make the kid do that? And that is the problem, is that there is no way to make a kid turn out in any particular way. Every method of making a kid do something brings in a whole host of costs. Every time you're bringing in coercion, you're not making a kid necessarily do something. What you're doing is you are raising the costs of them doing something else.



If you want them to learn math, you have to raise the costs of them playing video games or playing baseball or doing whatever else it is. And so is there a way for them to learn math that doesn't involve you raising the costs of them doing something else? And the answer is yes. There's an infinite number of ways to solve any problem and there's ways of making math fun. There's ways of just making it fun. Making games and you can go through all the different apps and you hear about all this kind of stuff, right? 



**Naval Ravikant: **In that sense, this philosophy, by the way, is very active parenting. So to the people who think this might just be neglect, it's the opposite. I would say it requires way more time investment, way more creativity up front.



**Aaron Stupple: **In one way, yeah. Managing kids with a lot of rules is a ton of work. This is a lot of work. But also, when it works, it opens up a huge amount of free time. 



**Tim Ferriss: **That does seem like, and feel free to refute this, but a parenting approach that is perhaps limited to the educated elite with enough time to operate from first principles and approach things this way. Which is not to negate the value of it because I think that there are probably bits and pieces that people can apply. 



**Naval Ravikant: **So there are versions of this that have been done in schools, by the way. There's a very famous book called *Summerhill* about a school in the UK. I forget when. Maybe it's still around, but it got famous long time ago. But it was very permissive schooling where the kids ran the school. They decided if they want to go to class or not. The teachers were just at the same peer level as the kids and were resources for the kids. Now, these were slightly older kids, but not that much older. I think there were kids in *Summerhill* who were like six, seven, eight years old, and it was very, very permissive. It's almost the school equivalent of Taking Children Seriously or *Sovereign Child* kind of philosophies. So it has been done in even a caregiver context.



**Tim Ferriss: **What happened?



**Naval Ravikant: **Supposedly, incredibly successful. 



**Tim Ferriss: **They didn't get killed with a big rock off the cliff? Just kidding.



**Naval Ravikant: **Yeah. It's for the same reason that anything that goes against the institutions doesn't get absorbed by the institutions.



**Tim Ferriss: **Yeah. Sure.



**Naval Ravikant: **Anything that is status-lowering for the people in power tends not to get adopted by people in power. That's a common thing. But look, yeah, nothing can work for everybody. I think there are some general principles out of here that are worth thinking through and challenging. Like I said, I've gone through Aaron's arguments in his book and I have adopted some of them. And my wife and I were talking about how we're going to try some more of them.



Because if it works, it's actually better for everybody. I am now much more keenly aware of some things. It's like some things, you learn about and then you become more keenly aware of things as a result. So I'm much more keenly aware how almost every conflict with a child is about a negotiation. They're negotiating for something because you have a rule. And then, you are playing little king or dictator arbitrarily renegotiating the rule on the fly. And then, they go off to the other parent and they try to renegotiate the rule if they don't like your result or they try to figure out how to work around it.



And when you start noticing that and you realize how much of your life is in negotiating rules, and creating rules, and routing around rules, and how many interactions around that, you start developing a distaste for it, right? It's like if you didn't used to brush your teeth and floss twice or three times a day, when you get used to that feeling of clean teeth, then you'll notice when there's a film on your teeth. But until you get to that point, you don't notice there's a film on your teeth.



Or if you're aware of your monkey mind, right? You meditate. Then you start noticing like, "Oh, my thoughts are running away." But before you started meditating, you never notice when your thoughts are running away. That's just normal. So now, when you're aware of how much of this is about creating rules for them to follow. Rules that, by the way, you would never inflict on anybody else, ever. Out of love, out of hate, out of anything. And that's a good litmus test that Aaron lays out which is, if you wouldn't do it to your spouse, if you wouldn't speak that way to your spouse, don't speak that way to your child. So you become more aware. And as you become more aware, you will — 



You will automatically make changes is my point. You automatically say, "You know what? I don't want to be negotiating a rule with you. Here's the thing, here's the reason I'm telling you to do it. Take it or leave it, man. But here's the reason. Let's just make sure you understand my reasoning. And if you don't agree, fine, do what you want." But I do find there's context and ages that that works better at.



**Tim Ferriss: **So the reason I wanted to have this conversation also is because I've said this before, I think it was from the documentary, *Objectified*, which is about industrial design. And it was maybe Smart Design, it could have been Frog Design. But they said the designing for the extremes informs the mean, but not vice versa. So I like that you, Aaron, are effectively an edge case who's implemented this to the nth degree.



And the hope of having you on the show, especially with Naval, is that people can take even one or two things. For instance, if they just take, "Don't speak to your child in a way you wouldn't speak to your spouse," that is a valuable principle that could take a million different forms. Or if you're solving lots of similar problems, maybe there's a meta problem you can solve once, right? Like the bacteria theory of disease or something or the germ theory of disease, for instance.

**Tim Ferriss: **I assume you're probably in touch with other people in not just the critical rationalism community, but in the *Sovereign Child* and Taking Children Seriously communities. What are some of the common wins, meaning things that work better than folks may have expected and then things that are particularly challenging for folks that you see? Not necessarily across the board, but as a pattern.



**Aaron Stupple: **The hardest thing is sibling conflict. I think that's the hardest thing, because I can't let my six-year-old beat up my four-year-old. And there's a wide range of aggression between a harsh word and physically pounding someone's face in. So you can block the physical blows, but there's still a lot of harshness going back and forth. It's very unpleasant. It's very disruptive to everybody else. And just sit back and say, "Well, I don't want to coerce anybody," is not a good option.



When I'm interacting one-on-one with my kids, I can think of solutions and creative solutions and stuff. But when my two kids are interacting with each other, neither of them have the background knowledge to be able to solve their problems often. And so, it's very hard to not insert myself into that and confuse that issue. But also, prevent them from spiraling out of control.



And so some things that I do to deal with that is I'll physically block. When they're trying to fight, I'll just get in the way and block the blows. And let the yelling happen, but prevent any kind of physical injury. And another big tip is to always give a kid a place to opt out. And this goes across the board. Any of our kids want to get away from things, they can go to their room and close the door and not have to worry about — well, just be alone. And this is almost a sacred right for adults, but kids, routinely, have zero privacy. And giving them the option of privacy gives them the option to opt out of almost anything and, really, just avoid a ton of coercion. Avoid the relationship damage that comes from just being forced to be face-to-face with somebody that you are struggling with. So I think that would be the biggest challenge.



**Naval Ravikant: **You had some good points on this in your book where, one, was make sure that the kids have clear ownership. They're not forced to share things. Just like you don't force adults to really share new things, you don't force the kids either. They can trade, they can negotiate, but they have clear ownership. And I actually just used this today.



Two items arrived at the house today. There was a set of Uno cards and a Pokemon box and I gave one to each boy and I assigned ownership. And I said, "You can trade and you can negotiate, but there's clear ownership." Otherwise if they're sharing, it's an infinite tug of war. When kids are fighting, they're really negotiating boundaries with each other. And you, as a parent, always show up late. And then, do you want to get involved in the middle of an adjudication? And a good rule of thumb is like, "Well, would you do that with two adults?" If your brother and your sister were fighting, would you show up in the middle and start adjudicating? No. If they started hitting each other, you'd probably stop them.



So the similar rules apply. If they're hitting each other, you get in the way and you're like, "Hey, hey, hey. I don't feel good about this." But on the other hand, if they're having an argument, you let them have the argument. If it's really loud and disruptive, you might say, "Hey, I'm in the house and you two are being very disruptive. I'm going to go elsewhere. You go elsewhere. But just keep it down. Settle your dispute, but keep it down." So I think the framework of trying to treat them like adults whenever possible and just — it's better to think of them as adults who don't have the full range of knowledge. And maybe they're still developing their powers of reasoning because they don't have the full infrastructure logic built up. 



**Tim Ferriss: **Naval, let me ask you this. I think a decent amount, and I've spoken to friends of mine with kids who are now — I've seen them go through high school, college, et cetera. And in some of these families, they, and even the kids themselves dislike consolation prizes, right? Everyone competes, everyone wins. Because it's not a reflection of real life when, ultimately, people get out into the wild. So learning to compete and all the friction and maybe disappointment that entails is important. And I suppose I'm wondering if you're training your kids to question everything and come to their own conclusions perhaps. And sure, understand the root reasoning around things. But do you expect your kids to be fully entrepreneurs and that's that, like they create their own utopia as the founder of a company? Because otherwise, like Aaron, I would imagine, at a hospital, there are plenty of rules. And so how do you teach someone to live in a world without rules in the household? Maybe I'm mischaracterizing that. You could tell me. And then, enter a world where there are lots of rules.



**Naval Ravikant: **You know how much of a rule breaker I am and how anti-social I am. So I'm fully fine with my kids not having friends, not getting along, and not being liked, and not fitting in. I think that's a superpower. It's a bonus.



**Tim Ferriss: **Okay. Aaron, we'll come to you.



**Aaron Stupple: **I think rules of courtesy are a great example. Being able to interact with people, courteously, conscientiously, being polite. And there's two approaches to that. You can force your kids to be polite all the time. In which case, they'll never really understand why. They don't understand graciousness and gratitude. They don't understand the subtleties of those things. And so they're ham-fisted when they're out in the world.



Whereas, if the focus is on the reasons for being polite, right? If you never force them to be polite and instead introduce them to the concepts. We use "please" and "thank you" all the time with our kids. We ask them to do things. We never force them. We never command them to do things. And so, conscientiousness. My wife and I talk with each other in the same way that we talk with our kids in terms of conscientiousness. And they understand. Again, not on an explicit level, but in an intuitive way, what these words are for and how they work. Just like they learn all the other words in the language. And so when they go into the world, everybody thinks their kids are great, but my kids, I think they're quite conscientious. They say, "please" and "thank you." They'll say things to their grandparents, to their extended family, the neighborhood friends, they actually interact with them, I would say, more adult or more mature than you would expect. They're the opposite of feral. They're never trying to manipulate people, they're never playing mind games. They're never defensive. They're instead just much more authentic. And I think that's what's the thing is, that it's always the reasons that matter the most. And when you're forcing your kids to do certain things, you're saying essentially that, "The reason doesn't matter. This is so important that I don't care what you think about it, you're doing it."



You are depriving them of the opportunity to learn the reason, and in place of that opportunity to learn the reason you are inserting your own authority as the reason. But when they go out into the world, you're not there. So now it's the reason for being conscientious and polite. So all the other rules about the world. And this gets to your point about constraints. And this is really a deep, and I think fascinating idea, is that knowledge is actually a constraint. The discovery of DNA constrained the ideas around how biological organisms reproduce. It's not about the humors, it's not about the vital force. It's this one molecule. And so that is an enormous step forward. And scientists stopped looking for other things because they had the knowledge of DNA.



And then once you learn DNA and you learn cellular structures and cellular organelles, all of these things further constrain how life works, it works by cells. And oh, wow it's not just — it's these little structures within cells. Or physics, for example. Then Newton discovers the laws of motion. Those are constraints on how the world works. And then Einstein fine-tunes them. And so as knowledge progresses, the constraints get tighter and tighter and tighter. And knowledge really rules out a lot of things.



**Naval Ravikant: **The human mind does not just take explanations. If that were the case, then I could just sit on the other end of ChatGPT and get everything I needed and I'd be brilliant. No, we have to recreate in our minds, we have to fit it into our existing network of theories. We have to falsify it for ourselves. We have to test it. We have to see how it fits into our other theories and explanations and carry it with some degree of certainty or some tentative pseudo probability of whether it's true or not. And so it's this discovery scientific process all the time. So when my kids are unhappy, for example, I try to help them out, but I'm like, "Hey, why are you making yourself unhappy?" It's a hint. Maybe there's not anything, an environment that's making you unhappy, maybe that's your reaction.



Or if they ask me something, I'll be like, "Well, let's guess. Why do we think that might be the case? What's a guess? Oh, okay. Well, why might that not be true?" And a lot of times they deflect me because there's Dad playing condescending scientists, which I know it shouldn't be. It's patronizing. I wouldn't talk to my spouse that way, so I'm already violating TCS. But I'm trying to do this knowledge creation thing, and it's actually really fun. So for a parent, one of the most gratifying things is when you get to connect with your child and discover something together, and my kids are already contradicting me.



They'll say, "Well, you promised to do that yesterday and you didn't do it today, so you broke your promise, Dad." Or they'll say, "Hey, you said this, but I think that's wrong. It's actually this." And that is very gratifying to a parent. From anybody else, your ego would actually get hurt if they said you're wrong. When your child says you're wrong and they're correct, your ego actually gets a boost. You feel better. That's the weird thing about having children. That's the genes in charge rather than the body. It feels great. So when this approach works, it is incredibly gratifying.



**Tim Ferriss: **I guess what I'm struggling with is that maximizing freedom is necessary to teach your children from first principles. It strikes me as absolutist, in a way, I guess. I mean, because I know scientists and writers who will do what you're describing, Naval, but they're not going to have a Willy Wonka Sweets Delight smorgasbord at children-grasping level in the house, right?



**Naval Ravikant: **But they'll each have different sets of rules for themselves. You do this, you interview all these over-performers, *Tools of Titans*, you compile all their habits.



**Tim Ferriss: **Yeah.



**Naval Ravikant: **Have you found any commonalities? Is there a single morning routine you would give everybody?



**Tim Ferriss: **No, no, no, no.



**Naval Ravikant: **Exactly. 



**Tim Ferriss: **There is no single routine.
