  ## COLLECTION WORKFLOW

  collection_workflow:
    batch_1_critical:
      sources: [source_001 through source_010]
      count: 10
      estimated_hours: 6-8
      parallelization: 3_concurrent_streams
      priority: IMMEDIATE
      focus: "VSL frameworks + NLP + Core story"

    batch_2_important:
      sources: [source_011 through source_025]
      count: 15
      estimated_hours: 8-10
      parallelization: 4_concurrent_streams
      priority: HIGH
      conditional: "After Batch 1 complete"
      focus: "AI integration + Products + Swipes"

    batch_3_supplementary:
      sources: [source_026 through source_038]
      count: 13
      estimated_hours: 12-15
      parallelization: 3_concurrent_streams
      priority: MEDIUM
      conditional: "If gaps identified or budget available for premium courses"
      focus: "Social media depth + Premium courses (evaluate budget)"

  ## PREMIUM CONTENT STRATEGY

  premium_content_strategy:
    investment_required:
      chatVSL: "$997+ (5-Step Formula detailed)"
      now_vsl: "$497+ (Original training)"
      attention_framework: "$1,497+ (PhD-level)"
      vsl_fast_track: "$297+ (NLP + viral)"
      total_estimated: "$3,000-$4,000"

    recommendation:
      phase_1_v1.0: "START with free content (sources 001-025)"
      evaluation_checkpoint: "After Batch 1-2, assess gaps"
      phase_2_v2.0: "IF gaps in frameworks, invest in ChatVSL ($997)"
      phase_3_v3.0: "IF advanced needed, add Attention Framework ($1,497)"

    rationale: |
      - Free content is SUBSTANTIAL (25 high-quality sources)
      - Can extract 80% of value from free sources
      - Premium courses are investment for 20% incremental depth
      - Start lean, validate need before investing
