  not_recommended:

    - specialist: "Napoleon Hill: Relationship Coach"
      reason: "Insufficient depth - relationships are Shadow Value #7 (taught importance, sacrificed in practice). Hill's own relationship patterns don't support specialist credibility. Low confidence (70%) in this domain."

    - specialist: "Napoleon Hill: Health & Wellness Coach"
      reason: "Out of scope - health/wellness not covered in Hill's philosophy beyond 'sound health' as general requirement. Would require entirely new content. Viability: <40%."

    - specialist: "Napoleon Hill: Spiritual Guide"
      reason: "Paradox violation - isolating 'spiritual' side of Spiritual Materialism paradox breaks core identity. Hill is INTEGRATED (spiritual + material), not purely spiritual. Would create 30% fidelity caricature."

  implementation_priority:
    1:
      specialist: "Success Coach"
      rationale: "Highest value, lowest effort, broadest market appeal. Core Hill content already optimized for this. Build first."

    2:
      specialist: "Business Strategist"
      rationale: "High value, premium pricing, clear differentiation. Requires moderate effort but high ROI. Build second."

    3:
      specialist: "Mindset Trainer"
      rationale: "Strong differentiation, growing market, leverages Hill's unique metaphysical angle. Build third."

    4:
      specialist: "Failure Analyst"
      rationale: "Niche but valuable. Lower priority due to smaller market. Build if demand emerges."

    5:
      specialist: "Sales Coach"
      rationale: "Competitive market, requires significant adaptation. Build only if specific demand or partnership opportunity."

  total_effort_if_all_built:
    time: "90-125 hours"
    cost_equivalent: "$9,000-$18,750 (at $100-150/hr consulting rate)"
    recommended_sequence: "Build incrementally (Success Coach → validate market → Business Strategist → validate → Mindset Trainer → evaluate further)"

  generalista_vs_specialists:
    generalista:
      use_case: "Comprehensive Napoleon Hill assistant (all domains)"
      audience: "General public, Hill enthusiasts, researchers"
      pricing: "Free or low-cost (democratize success knowledge - Hill's Value #1)"
      fidelity: "94% (full 8-layer cognitive architecture)"

    specialists:
      use_case: "Targeted, high-value applications in specific domains"
      audience: "Paying clients with specific needs"
      pricing: "$50-500/session (premium specialized expertise)"
      fidelity: "85-90% (narrowed scope, but deep in domain)"

    strategy: "Build generalista FIRST (foundation), then extract specialists as market demands"

  market_validation_approach:
    1: "Launch generalista (free/low-cost)"
    2: "Gather usage data (which domains most requested?)"
    3: "Identify highest-demand specialist (likely Success Coach or Business Strategist)"
    4: "Build and validate ONE specialist first"
    5: "If successful, build next priority specialist"
    6: "Do NOT build all 5 upfront (risk of low ROI on lower-priority ones)"

  notes:
    - "All specialists leverage existing cognitive architecture (no new Layer 8 analysis needed)"
    - "Effort is in emphasis shifting, not new content creation"
    - "Paradoxes must be maintained in ALL specialists (non-negotiable for authenticity)"
    - "Generalista remains foundation (specialists are derivatives, not replacements)"
    - "Market demand should drive build priority (not just viability scores)"

confidence: "90%"
