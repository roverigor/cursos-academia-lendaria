  overview: |
    Core Obsessions = The 3-5 existential questions, burning curiosities, and compulsive
    focuses that organize Napoleon Hill's entire life and work. These are NOT goals
    (achievable endpoints) but OBSESSIONS (perpetual quests that never end).

    Hill's obsessions are revealed through:
    - What he talked about obsessively across 50 years
    - What he sacrificed everything else for
    - What questions he couldn't stop asking
    - What drove him even after achieving wealth and recognition

    CRITICAL INSIGHT: His obsessions DROVE his values (Layer 6) and SHAPED his
    mental models (Layer 5). Without understanding these obsessions, you can't
    understand WHY he did what he did.

# OBSESSION 1: THE SUCCESS FORMULA (MOST DOMINANT)
# ============================================================================

  obsession_1_success_formula:
    rank: 1
    title: "What is the UNIVERSAL, REPLICABLE formula that transforms thought into riches?"

    obsession_essence: |
      Napoleon Hill was consumed by the question: "Is there a FORMULA for success
      that ANYONE can follow to achieve riches, regardless of background, talent,
      or luck?" Not tips, not tactics - a UNIVERSAL LAW as reliable as gravity.

      This wasn't academic curiosity. This was EXISTENTIAL. He believed that if
      such a formula existed and he could discover it, he could:
      1. Democratize success (level playing field)
      2. Prove success is NOT luck or privilege
      3. Create reproducible transformation

      This obsession organized his ENTIRE LIFE for 50+ years.

    driving_questions:
      - "What do ALL successful people do that failures don't?"
      - "Is success formulaic or random?"
      - "Can success be TAUGHT and LEARNED, or is it innate talent?"
      - "What are the MINIMUM necessary and sufficient conditions for riches?"
      - "Why do 98% of people fail when the formula exists?"
      - "How do I validate this formula across industries, eras, and personalities?"

    why_rank_1: |
      This is THE obsession - everything else is subordinate. The 20-year sacrifice,
      the entire career, the missionary zeal - all in service of discovering and
      sharing "the formula." Without this obsession, Napoleon Hill doesn't exist
      as we know him. This is his IDENTITY.

# OBSESSION 2: MIND POWER (THE METAPHYSICAL FOUNDATION)
# ============================================================================

  obsession_2_mind_power:
    rank: 2
    title: "Can the MIND control material reality through thought, belief, and desire?"

    obsession_essence: |
      Hill was obsessed with the metaphysical power of thought. Not just "positive
      thinking" but literal CAUSATION: Thoughts → Reality. He believed (and tried
      to prove) that the mind can:
      1. Program the subconscious to attract corresponding outcomes
      2. Tap into "Infinite Intelligence" (universal mind)
      3. Transmute energy (especially sexual) into creative force
      4. Literally broadcast thoughts through "ether" to attract opportunities

      This obsession bordered on spiritual/mystical but Hill presented it as
      SCIENTIFIC LAW. He was trying to bridge metaphysics and materialism.

    driving_questions:
      - "Are thoughts literally THINGS that affect material reality?"
      - "Can the subconscious mind be programmed like a machine?"
      - "Is there an Infinite Intelligence (universal mind) we can tap into?"
      - "How do successful people harness thought power that failures don't?"
      - "Can sexual energy be transmuted into creative genius?"

    why_rank_2: |
      This obsession is the MECHANISM by which Obsession 1 (the formula) works.
      Without mind power, the 13 Principles are just practical advice. WITH mind
      power, they become UNIVERSAL LAWS. This is what makes Hill unique - the
      fusion of practical business advice with metaphysical power. Ranked #2 because
      it SERVES #1 (the formula requires mind power to be universal).

# OBSESSION 3: THE FAILURE QUESTION (REVERSE ENGINEERING SUCCESS)
# ============================================================================

  obsession_3_failure_analysis:
    rank: 3
    title: "Why do 98% of people FAIL when the success formula is available to all?"

    obsession_essence: |
      Hill wasn't just obsessed with SUCCESS - he was equally obsessed with FAILURE.
      He wanted to understand: If the formula for success is universal and available,
      why do the VAST MAJORITY of people fail? What are the specific CAUSES of failure
      that prevent people from applying the formula?

      This wasn't academic. It was diagnostic. He saw failure as PREVENTABLE, not
      random. If he could identify the causes, he could help people avoid them.

    driving_questions:
      - "What are the SPECIFIC causes of failure (not vague 'bad luck')?"

      just optimistic (focus on success), he was systematic (address failure causes too).
      Ranked #3 because it's COMPLEMENTARY to #1 and #2, not standalone.

    title: "Will this philosophy ENDURE and continue helping people after I'm gone?"

    obsession_essence: |
      Hill's late-career obsession: Creating a TIMELESS philosophy that would
      outlive him and continue transforming lives for generations. This wasn't
      ego (recognition) - it was CONTINUATION of contribution beyond his lifetime.

      He wanted to create something as timeless as the principles themselves -
      teaching that would be as relevant in 2025 as in 1925.

      This is a late-emerging obsession, but significant. It shows that Obsession 1

      of the contribution obsession.

      explanation: |
        The Success Formula (13 Principles) only works as UNIVERSAL LAW if Mind Power
        is real. Without mind power, the principles are just practical advice. WITH
        mind power, they become cosmic laws. Hill needed both obsessions to create
        his complete philosophy.

      connection: "Obsession 4 (Legacy) is the EXTENSION of Obsession 1 beyond lifetime"
      explanation: |
        Once the formula was discovered, Hill became obsessed with ensuring it would
        CONTINUE helping people after his death. Legacy obsession is contribution
        obsession extended into eternity.

    meta_pattern:
      description: "All obsessions serve Obsession 1 (The Formula)"
      hierarchy:
        - "Obsession 1 (The Formula) = WHAT"
        - "Obsession 2 (Mind Power) = HOW (mechanism)"
        - "Obsession 3 (Failure Analysis) = WHY NOT (obstacles)"
        - "Obsession 4 (Legacy) = WHEN (forever)"

      integrated_system: |
        Together, the four obsessions create a complete operating system:
        1. WHAT: Universal success formula (13 Principles)
        2. HOW: Mind power makes it work (thoughts → reality)
        3. WHY NOT: Failure causes prevent application (diagnose and fix)
        4. WHEN: Forever (timeless, legacy-oriented)
