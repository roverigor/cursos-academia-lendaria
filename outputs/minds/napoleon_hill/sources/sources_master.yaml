      notes: |
        HIGHEST PRIORITY SOURCE. Think and Grow Rich is the foundation of Napoleon Hill's
        philosophy and global recognition. Original 1937 edition is public domain. Contains
        the complete 13 Principles framework. Essential for all 8 DNA Mental layers.

        Best-selling self-help book of all time (70+ million copies). Cultural touchstone.
        Language is 1937 style - requires modernization awareness. Some spiritual/occult
        elements (sixth sense, Infinite Intelligence) are present but less explicit than
        in Outwitting the Devil.

      notes: |
        CRITICAL SOURCE - Most comprehensive work. Expanded 17 Principles framework
        (vs. 13 in Think and Grow Rich). Written from 1925 manuscript, published 1928.

        This is Hill's magnum opus before condensing to Think and Grow Rich (1937).
        Contains deeper philosophical content and more extensive case studies. Essential
        for Layers 5-8 (beliefs, paradoxes, architecture, singularity).

        1100+ pages makes this time-intensive but invaluable. Represents Hill's thinking
        at age 45 (early career). Compare to later works for temporal evolution.

      notes: |
        CRITICAL SOURCE - ONLY preserved video of Napoleon Hill teaching. Filmed at age 71
        (mature period). Collaboration with W. Clement Stone shows partnership dynamics.

        MUST TRANSCRIBE FULLY for linguistic analysis (Layer 2). Verbal patterns, tone,
        rhythm, pace, emphasis - all critical for authentic voice cloning. Body language
        and visual teaching style inform behavioral patterns (Layer 3).

        13 episodes × 30 minutes = 6.5 hours of content. Budget $20-50 for automated
        transcription (AssemblyAI or Otter.ai) to save time vs. manual transcription.

        Preserved on masterkey.tv and streaming platforms. High-value investment.

        limitations: "Radio broadcasts may have been edited before book publication"

      notes: |
        CRITICAL SOURCE - Q&A format is gold for cognitive analysis. Unscripted (or
        semi-scripted) responses reveal authentic decision patterns and values.

        1953 radio broadcasts = age 70 (late career, mature philosophy). "Five Foundations
        for Success" framework introduced here. Published as book in 2015 with editor
        notes and foreword.

        Q&A format allows extraction of:
        - How Hill responds to challenges (behavioral patterns)
        - What values dominate when forced to choose (values hierarchy)
        - How he structures answers (cognitive architecture)
        - Contradictions between different answers (paradoxes)

        Already transcribed (published as book), saving transcription effort. High value.

      notes: |
        CRITICAL SOURCE - Most controversial and revealing work. Written in 1938 immediately
        after Think and Grow Rich but suppressed for 73 years due to spiritual/occult content
        and criticism of organized religion and education system.

        Published 2011 with Sharon Lechter annotations. FILTER EDITOR ADDITIONS carefully -
        focus on Hill's original 1938 text, not 2011 commentary.

        ESSENTIAL FOR:
        - Layer 5 (Beliefs): Deepest spiritual beliefs, occult elements, Infinite Intelligence
        - Layer 6 (Paradoxes): Good vs. evil, freedom vs. control, drift vs. definiteness
        - Layer 8 (Singularity): Most authentic philosophical core, uncensored content

        Dialogue format (Hill "interviews the Devil") allows Hill to express controversial
        views through character voice. Reveals beliefs he couldn't publish in mainstream work.

        Suppression itself is telling - what was too controversial for 1938-2011? This reveals
        authentic Hill vs. marketed Hill.

    critical_analysis_notes: |
      **CRITICAL AWARENESS:**

      1. **Credibility Context Required:**
         - Carnegie meeting disputed by historians (no evidence found)
         - 500 interviews claim questioned (no documentation)
         - Fraud allegations and failed business ventures documented
         - Hill's personal wealth modest despite teaching wealth creation

         **ANALYSIS APPROACH:** Separate Hill's *principles* (proven valuable - 88 years, 70M books)
         from his *origin story* (disputed). Focus on what works (frameworks) vs. what's mythologized
         (Carnegie meeting). Transparent positioning essential.

      2. **Temporal Evolution is Key:**
         - Early career (1925-1937): Wealth obsession, ambition, success at any cost
         - Mid career (1937-1959): Peak influence, collaboration with Stone, PMA focus
         - Late career (1967): Shift to peace, balance, "grow rich with peace of mind"

         **PARADOX ANALYSIS:** Did Hill resolve wealth/peace paradox in old age? Or did he never
         achieve the wealth he taught, leading to philosophical pivot? This is Layer 6/8 gold.

      3. **Suppressed vs. Published Content:**
         - Outwitting the Devil (written 1938, suppressed 73 years) = authentic uncensored Hill
         - Think and Grow Rich (published 1937, bestseller) = marketable Hill

         **BELIEF EXTRACTION:** Compare suppressed content (Outwitting) to published content (TAGR).
         What did Hill truly believe vs. what did he think would sell? This reveals Layer 5/8.

      4. **Collaboration Reveals Influence:**
         - Solo works (TAGR, Law of Success) = pure Hill
         - Stone collaborations (PMA, Mental Dynamite) = Hill + Stone influence

         **PATTERN ANALYSIS:** How does Hill's voice change with Stone? Does PMA concept originate
         with Hill or Stone? This reveals Layer 3 (behavioral adaptation).

      5. **Linguistic Goldmine in Video/Audio:**
         - TV series (1954, age 71) = mature, polished teaching
         - Audio lectures (1950s) = Master Course delivery
         - Radio broadcasts (1953) = Q&A responsiveness

         **LAYER 2 PRIORITY:** Transcribe and analyze ALL audio/video for tone, rhythm, pace,
         verbal patterns, emphasis. This is irreplaceable for voice cloning authenticity.

      Collection phase ready to execute. All sources identified and availability confirmed.
      95% confidence in collection feasibility. Batch 1 (5 critical sources) can begin
      immediately with free downloads and strategic purchases.

      Transcription is single largest cost/time factor. Recommend automated transcription
      (Otter.ai Premium $16.99/mo or AssemblyAI API $0.45/30 min) to save $500+ vs.
      professional human transcription while maintaining good accuracy.

      Library loans can reduce book purchase costs by $40-60 (check Libby, OverDrive for
      digital lending of copyrighted works).
