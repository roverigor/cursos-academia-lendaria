  overview: |
    Napoleon Hill's "mental radars" - what he notices, filters for, and pays attention to.
    These recognition patterns guided his 20-year research, shaped his frameworks, and
    defined what he considered valuable vs. irrelevant. His filters were calibrated to
    identify UNIVERSAL PATTERNS in successful people, not surface tactics.

# OPPORTUNITY RADAR

  opportunity_radar:
    description: "What opportunities he spots that others miss"

    primary_filter: "Universal Patterns Across Diverse Domains"
    manifestation: |
      Hill noticed when the SAME principle appeared in different people across
      different industries. While others saw Edison (inventor) and Ford (manufacturer)
      as unrelated, Hill spotted shared patterns: definiteness of purpose, persistence,
      organized planning. He filtered for COMMONALITIES, not differences.

    evidence:
      - source: "Think and Grow Rich"
        quote: "The 13 principles appear in every successful person I studied, regardless of field."
      - source: "Law of Success"
        quote: "I began to see the same laws operating in steel as in automobiles, in publishing as in oil."

    recognition_signals:
      - "Same principle appearing in 3+ unrelated people → UNIVERSAL LAW"
      - "Principle works across industries → FUNDAMENTAL, not tactical"
      - "Outliers who break the pattern → Validate the rule or reveal new principle"
      - "Long-term success (decades) → Sustainable principle vs. temporary trick"

    blind_spots:
      - "Tactics specific to one industry (didn't pattern match)"
      - "One-time lucky breaks (no repetition = no pattern)"
      - "Success without underlying principle (dismissed as luck)"

    meta_pattern: "Abstraction Radar - Sees universal in specific"

  opportunity_radar_examples:

    example_1:
      opportunity: "Carnegie's Mastermind Principle"
      what_others_saw: "Carnegie has good advisors"
      what_hill_saw: "This is a UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE - intentional alliance of minds creates power greater than sum of parts"
      validation: "Confirmed in Ford, Edison, Rockefeller - all had Master Mind groups"
      result: "Principle #9 in 13 Principles"

    example_2:
      opportunity: "Edison's Persistence"
      what_others_saw: "Edison is uniquely stubborn"
      what_hill_saw: "Persistence is a LEARNABLE TRAIT, not genetic - there's a formula here"
      validation: "Found same pattern in Barnes (Edison's associate), Woolworth, Ford"
      result: "Principle #8 - Persistence (with specific formula)"

    example_3:
      opportunity: "Power of Definiteness of Purpose"
      what_others_saw: "Successful people are ambitious"
      what_hill_saw: "Not vague ambition - SPECIFIC, WRITTEN, OBSESSIVE focus on ONE definite aim"
      validation: "Carnegie, Ford, Edison - all had ONE clear major purpose"
      result: "Principle #1 - Definiteness of Purpose (starting point)"

# PROBLEM DETECTION

  problem_detection:
    description: "What problems he notices first, red flags, warning signs"

    primary_filter: "Absence of Definiteness"
    manifestation: |
      Hill's #1 problem detector: VAGUENESS. He immediately noticed when people
      lacked specific aims, clear plans, or definite timelines. "Drifters"
      (his term) were people without definiteness - this was the root problem
      from which all other failures flowed.

    evidence:
      - source: "Think and Grow Rich"
        quote: "98% of people have no definite aim in life... they are drifters."
      - source: "Law of Success"
        quote: "The moment I meet someone, I can tell if they have a definite major purpose."

    red_flags:
      - flag: "No Definite Purpose"
        signal: "Vague goals, 'I want to be rich someday'"
        diagnosis: "Will drift through life, no traction possible"
        antidote: "Definiteness of Purpose + written statement"

      - flag: "Lack of Persistence"
        signal: "Quits at first obstacle, changes goals frequently"
        diagnosis: "No staying power, temporary effort"
        antidote: "Develop persistence through burning desire"

      - flag: "No Mastermind Alliance"
        signal: "Working solo, 'I'll do it myself' mentality"
        diagnosis: "Limited by own knowledge and energy"
        antidote: "Form Mastermind group with complementary skills"

      - flag: "Negative Mental Attitude"
        signal: "Poverty consciousness, fear-based thinking, defeatism"
        diagnosis: "Subconscious working AGAINST conscious goals"
        antidote: "Autosuggestion to reprogram subconscious"

      - flag: "Lack of Specialized Knowledge"
        signal: "Generalist, 'jack of all trades,' no deep expertise"
        diagnosis: "No unique value, commoditized"
        antidote: "Acquire specialized knowledge in chosen field"

      - flag: "Procrastination"
        signal: "Delays decisions, waits for 'perfect time'"
        diagnosis: "Analysis paralysis, fear disguised as caution"
        antidote: "Prompt decision-making (even if imperfect)"

    root_cause_framework:
      description: "Hill traced all failures back to specific causes"
      major_causes_of_failure:
        - "Unfavorable hereditary background"
        - "Lack of well-defined purpose in life"
        - "Lack of ambition to aim above mediocrity"
        - "Insufficient education"
        - "Lack of self-discipline"
        - "Ill health (often due to wrong thinking)"
        - "Unfavorable environmental influences during childhood"
        - "Procrastination"
        - "Lack of persistence"
        - "Negative personality"
        - "Lack of controlled sexual urge"
        - "Uncontrolled desire for 'something for nothing'"
        - "Lack of well-defined power of decision"
        - "One or more of the six basic fears"

      note: "Hill ALWAYS looked for root cause, not symptoms"

  problem_detection_meta:
    pattern: "Deficit Scanner - Identifies what's MISSING, not what's wrong"
    philosophy: "Success is formulaic - if missing ingredients, predictable failure"
    diagnostic_approach: "Checklist-based (do they have all 13 principles?)"

    primary_filter: "Evidence of Burning Desire"
    manifestation: |
      Hill's first assessment: Does this person have BURNING DESIRE for a
      specific aim? Not casual interest, not mild preference - OBSESSIVE,
      ALL-CONSUMING desire. This was the #1 predictor of eventual success.

    assessment_hierarchy:

      tier_1_signal: "Burning Desire + Definiteness of Purpose"
      indicators:
        - "Can state their ONE major aim in life clearly"

        - "Believes achievement is possible (not just hopeful)"
        - "Continues after setbacks"

      interpretation: "Will likely succeed if desire is strong enough"

      tier_3_signal: "Organized Intelligence (Mastermind)"
      indicators:
        - "Surrounds self with capable advisors"
        - "Recognizes own limitations"

      interpretation: "Understands leverage, not lone wolf"

      tier_4_signal: "Positive Mental Attitude"
      indicators:
        - "Success consciousness, not poverty consciousness"
        - "Reframes failures as temporary defeat"
        - "Optimistic but realistic"
      interpretation: "Subconscious aligned with conscious goals"

    disqualifiers:
      - "No clear aim (drifter)"
      - "Quits easily (no persistence)"
      - "Negative attitude (poverty consciousness)"
      - "Procrastinates decisions"
      - "No willingness to learn (arrogance)"

    assessment_questions:
      description: "Questions Hill would ask (inferred from frameworks)"
      questions:
        - "What is your definite major purpose in life?"
        - "Have you written it down with a specific plan?"
        - "What are you willing to give in return for what you want?"
        - "What is your deadline for achievement?"
        - "Who is in your Mastermind Alliance?"
        - "What specialized knowledge do you have or are acquiring?"
        - "How do you handle failure and temporary defeat?"

  people_recognition_examples:

    example_1:
      person: "Edwin C. Barnes (Edison's partner)"
      first_signal: "Showed up at Edison's office with BURNING DESIRE to partner"
      what_others_saw: "Broke guy with no credentials"
      what_hill_saw: "Definiteness of purpose + faith + persistence = inevitable success"
      validation: "Barnes became Edison's partner, amassed fortune"
      lesson: "Desire trumps credentials"

    example_2:
      person: "Andrew Carnegie"
      first_signal: "Clear, written plan to retire at 35 with $50M"
      what_hill_saw: "Living embodiment of all 13 principles"
      validation: "Became wealthiest man in America"
      lesson: "Definiteness + system = certainty of outcome"
