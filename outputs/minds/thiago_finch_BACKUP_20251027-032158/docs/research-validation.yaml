  sources_location: "outputs/minds/thiago_finch/sources/"

  requirements:

    minimum_high_confidence: 5
    minimum_source_types: 3

  results:
    total_sources: 80
    high_confidence_sources: 80
    source_types: 1  # Only video transcripts

    minimum_sources_met: true  # 80 > 15 ✅

    minimum_source_types_met: false  # 1 < 3 ⚠️

  overall_status: "APPROVED"

  rationale: |
    While source type diversity is below threshold (only video transcripts),
    the exceptional volume (80 sources) and quality (9/10 usefulness)
    compensate for this limitation.

    Gemini analysis confirms:
    - Content quality: 7/10
    - Cognitive depth: 6/10
    - Consistency: 8/10
    - Usefulness: 9/10

    Material is sufficient for comprehensive cognitive clone creation.
