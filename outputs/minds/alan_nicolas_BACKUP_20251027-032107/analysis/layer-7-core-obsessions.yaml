  notes: |
    Core Obsessions were explicitly analyzed in modelo-do-eu.md with remarkable depth.
    The document traces how obsessions evolved through life phases, how they manifest
    in behavior, and how they drive current work.

    All 7 obsessions identified have overwhelming behavioral evidence across sources.
    Obsessions are not theoretical - they show up in every project, every decision,
    every piece of content created.

    This is the "why behind the why" - understanding these obsessions is key to
    replicating Alan Nicolas's decision-making patterns and priorities.
