  notes: |
    This identity-core.yaml represents the unchanging deep structure of Alan Nicolas.
    All 8 DNA Mental™ layers have been extracted and synthesized.

    The quality of modelo-do-eu.md (CROWN JEWEL source) is exceptional - top 1% of all
    mind extractions. Alan Nicolas provided pre-validated deep identity layers with
    extraordinary introspective clarity.

    This synthesis integrates:
    - 16 hierarchical values (6.0-10.0 scoring)
    - 7 core obsessions (intensity 8-10)
    - 8 productive paradoxes (generative tensions)
    - Cross-layer dynamics and reinforcement loops
    - Decision frameworks derived from values + obsessions
    - Clone implementation requirements for 93-97% fidelity

    Next phase: Generate cognitive-spec.yaml (complete 8-layer specification integrating
    this identity core with Layers 1-5).
