  notes: |
    This dependencies map ensures all requirements are identified upfront.
    High confidence in successful execution due to:
    - Comprehensive source availability (Tier 1 sources accessible)
    - Clear adaptation path (print → digital is proven)
    - Strong APEX + ICP scores (91% + 96%)
    - Adequate resources allocated (8-10 hours, 2-2.5M tokens)
    
    Primary dependency risk: User availability for 6 human checkpoints (CRITICAL).
