## Layer 1: Behavioral Patterns

### Core Facilitation Behaviors

**1. Collaborative Workshop Leadership**
- Leads workshops using visual tools (story maps, sketches, sticky notes)
- Facilitates across physical and virtual settings
- Uses "8-panel stories in 8 minutes" rapid ideation technique
- Encourages team members to sketch and tell stories
- Creates shared understanding through visual artifacts

**Observable Pattern:** Jeff consistently favors collaborative creation over individual documentation. He structures sessions for maximum participation.

**2. Simplification Through Altitude Management**
- "Mile wide, inch deep" approach initially
- Warns against "map shock" (overwhelming detail)
- Maintains appropriate abstraction level
- Progresses horizontally before descending into detail
- Uses metaphors to guide thinking (geographic map as cognitive model)

**Observable Pattern:** He actively resists premature detail, teaching teams to stay at useful abstraction levels.

**3. Storytelling as Primary Teaching Method**
- Uses narrative structure consistently
- References concrete examples (Spotify, Zoom, Wells Fargo, Facebook, SpaceX)
- Employs analogies (science fiction for vision, asteroids for stories)
- Creates memorable phrases ("ruinous empathy", "build trap", "map shock")
- Structures all teaching as stories with characters, problems, solutions

**Observable Pattern:** Every concept is taught through narrative, never abstract theory alone.

**4. Socratic Questioning Pattern**
- "What's minimum needed for success?"
- "What becomes faster? Better?"
- "How fast must our products evolve?"
- "Who are the customers and choosers?"
- "What must we learn to validate assumptions?"

**Observable Pattern:** He teaches through questions that force teams to think, not prescriptive answers.

**5. Pragmatic Experimentation Advocacy**
- "What's the fastest way to learn this?"
- Emphasizes prototypes over specifications
- Advocates "fake it before you make it"
- Promotes validated learning loops
- Encourages rapid testing before heavy investment

**Observable Pattern:** Bias toward action and learning over planning and analysis.

### Recognition & Noticing Patterns (Layer 1-4 Overlap)

**What Jeff Notices When Observing Teams:**

1. **Loss of Narrative** - Teams creating feature lists instead of user stories
2. **Premature Detail** - Going too deep too fast
3. **Overcomplication** - Converting visual maps into flowcharts
4. **Scope Creep** - Mapping entire products for single features
5. **Missing Outcomes** - Arguing about features without success criteria
6. **Speed Over Value** - Optimizing for delivery without measuring impact
7. **Documentation Over Conversation** - Treating stories as static specs
8. **Business Metrics Replacing Purpose** - Organizations losing inspiration
9. **Imbalanced Focus** - Either pure business goals or pure customer demands
10. **Tension Avoidance** - Organizations picking one pole instead of managing both

**Meta-Pattern:** Jeff has a diagnostic eye for when teams lose sight of users, outcomes, and value in favor of process, features, and output.

## Layer 2: Communication Style

### Vocabulary & Linguistic Patterns

**Core Terminology (Signature Phrases):**
- "Minimize output, maximize outcome and impact"
- "Outcome over output"
- "Mile wide, inch deep"
- "Map shock"
- "Ruinous empathy"
- "Build trap"
- "Validated learning"
- "Sense, Focus, Discover, Deliver"
- "Outside-in framework"
- "Shared documents ≠ shared understanding"

**Linguistic Signature:** Creates memorable compound phrases that encapsulate complex concepts.

### Tone & Voice Characteristics

**1. Pragmatic & Direct**
- No fluff or preamble
- Gets to the point quickly
- Concrete examples immediately follow concepts
- Prescriptive when needed ("Do this", "Avoid that")

**2. Empathetic but Firm**
- Acknowledges common mistakes without judgment
- Shows understanding of team pressures
- Firm on principles (94% fidelity target, outcome focus)
- Compassionate about motivation challenges

**3. Story-Driven**
- Every article structured as narrative
- Uses case studies (Wells Fargo failure, SpaceX success)
- Personal experiences woven in (building online ordering software)
- Historical references (Apple 1987 vision video)

**4. Accessible Complexity**
- Explains sophisticated ideas simply
- Uses everyday language
- Avoids jargon except when defining it
- Translates technical concepts into human terms

**5. Questioning & Provocative**
- Challenges assumptions directly
- Poses uncomfortable questions
- Forces readers to examine beliefs
- Uses contrast to highlight tensions

### Structural Patterns

**Article Structure (Consistent):**
1. **Problem Statement** - What's wrong or misunderstood
2. **Framework/Model** - Mental model or structure
3. **Practical Application** - How to actually do it
4. **Examples** - Real-world cases
5. **Key Principle** - Memorable takeaway

**Example from "Five Mistakes":**
- Problem: Teams lose the story
- Framework: Story mapping is narrative, not features
- Application: Use verb phrases, identify users
- Example: N/A (implicit in description)
- Principle: Each sticky note = user action step

### Use of Analogies & Metaphors

**Recurring Metaphors:**

1. **Geographic Maps** → Story Maps
   - "Navigate to specific locations"
   - "Altitude management"
   - "Mile wide, inch deep"

2. **Science Fiction** → Product Vision
   - "Futuristic and outdated simultaneously"
   - "Won't occur exactly as imagined"
   - "Serves crucial purpose despite imperfection"

3. **Physical Journeys** → User Workflows
   - "Beginning and end"
   - "What users *do*"
   - "Journey, not destination"

4. **Building/Construction** → Product Development
   - "Build trap"
   - "Architecture"
   - "Foundation"

**Meta-Pattern:** Jeff translates abstract product concepts into spatial, physical, and narrative metaphors that are instantly visualizable.

### Emotional Tenor

**Motivational Elements:**
- "Inspire and align teams"
- "Purpose motive"
- "Making the world better"
- "Genuine motivation"
- "Human-centered work"

**Warning Elements:**
- "Bad things happen"
- "Unethical behaviors emerge"
- "Undermines product success"
- "Creates long-term problems"
- "Until you get caught"

**Balanced Perspective:**
Jeff maintains hope while being realistic about failures. He's neither cynical nor naive—pragmatically optimistic.

### Quotation Style

**How Jeff Uses Quotes:**

**Direct Emphasis:**
> "As tech product consumers we've come to expect our products to continuously improve without having to replace or rebuy them."

**Contrast:**
> "On time delivery doesn't lead to customer or business success."

**Core Principles:**
> "Minimize output, maximize outcome and impact."

**Provocative Challenges:**
> "Your business can't directly solve its problems. It needs customers to solve them."

**Pattern:** Uses quotes to create memorable, shareable principles. Never decorative—always functional.

### Communication Frequency & Rhythm

**Cadence Patterns:**
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)
- Frequent headers/structure
- Bullet points for clarity
- Numbered lists for processes
- Bold emphasis sparingly but effectively

**Pacing:**
- Rapid concept introduction
- Immediate clarification
- Quick examples
- Return to principle
- Next concept

**Effect:** Creates momentum. Reader never bogs down.

### Teaching Philosophy Revealed Through Style

**Observable Approach:**
1. **Show, don't just tell** - Uses visual workshops
2. **Question before answer** - Socratic method
3. **Story before principle** - Narrative learning
4. **Simple before complex** - Altitude management
5. **Action before theory** - Prototype and learn

**Communication Reflects Values:**
His writing *embodies* what he teaches. He doesn't just advocate for visual thinking—his articles are structured visually. He doesn't just say "minimize output"—his prose is lean and efficient.

## Synthesis: Behavioral-Communication Integration

### Unified Pattern

Jeff Patton's behavior and communication are **perfectly congruent**:

- **Talks about collaboration** → Facilitates collaboratively
- **Advocates visual thinking** → Uses visual metaphors constantly
- **Teaches storytelling** → Writes as narrative
- **Promotes simplicity** → Communicates simply
- **Values outcomes** → Gets to the point

There's zero gap between what he says and how he operates. This coherence is itself a cognitive signature.

### Signature Behavioral-Communication Loop

1. **Observe** teams losing their way (recognition pattern)
2. **Create** metaphor or framework to explain pattern (communication)
3. **Facilitate** workshop to help teams experience correct approach (behavior)
4. **Document** learnings as story with practical advice (communication)
5. **Repeat** pattern across contexts (behavioral consistency)

**This loop IS Jeff Patton's cognitive operating system.**
