## Layer 5: Mental Models & Frameworks

### Primary Framework: Continuous Product Improvement Cycle

**The Four Phases (Interconnected, Not Sequential):**

```
SENSE → FOCUS → DISCOVER → DELIVER
  ↑                              ↓
  ←―――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
       (Continuous Loop)
```

**1. SENSE: Listen and Learn**
- **Tactical Sensing:** Current users (interviews, analytics, support, surveys)
- **Strategic Sensing:** Potential customers (rejected, abandoned, unaddressed markets)
- **Technical Sensing:** Technology landscape (architecture, emerging tools)

**Mental Model:** Organization as organism sensing environment through multiple organs.

**2. FOCUS: Prioritize with Vision and Strategy**
- **Vision:** Future customer behavior (years ahead)
- **Strategy:** Phased steps toward vision
- **Target Outcomes:** Measurable behavior changes (OKRs)
- **Balanced Budgeting:** Strategic 33% + Tactical 33% + Technical 33%

**Mental Model:** Focus as filtering overwhelming options through strategic lens.

**3. DISCOVER: Analyze, Design, Test**
- **Many Ideas:** Initial concepts rarely best
- **Acknowledge Failure:** 80% of features rarely/never used
- **Validated Learning:** Expose assumptions, test cheaply/quickly
- **Questions:** What must we learn? What's fastest way to learn?

**Mental Model:** Discovery as risk reduction through rapid learning loops.

**4. DELIVER: Build and Release**
- **Fixed Timeboxes:** Sprints (typically 2 weeks)
- **Fixed Team Size:** Control costs
- **Fixed Scope:** Agreed at sprint start
- **Quality Focus:** Speed, predictability, quality

**Mental Model:** Delivery as predictable manufacturing after discovery reduces uncertainty.

**Integration Principle:** All four phases run simultaneously in healthy organizations. Bottleneck is usually NOT delivery—it's sense, focus, or discover.

### Secondary Framework: Outside-In Thinking

**Core Model:**

```
OUTSIDE (What Matters)          INSIDE (Less Important)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- Customers (choosers)          - Features list
- Users (actual usage)          - Requirements doc
- Value proposition             - Technical specs
- Alternatives (competition)    - Implementation plan
- Outcomes (behavior change)    - Output (features shipped)
- Impact (business results)     - Velocity metrics
```

**Principle:** "What's most important about products isn't what's inside: those features and benefits. It's what's outside."

**Mental Model:** Product as interface between organization and market, not internal artifact.

### Tertiary Framework: Story Mapping as Cognitive Structure

**Spatial Mental Model:**

```
HORIZONTAL AXIS = User narrative flow (left to right = time)
VERTICAL AXIS = Priority/Detail (top = critical, bottom = nice-to-have)

Activities → Steps → Details
[High-level] [Medium] [Granular]
```

**Key Principles:**
- Geography as metaphor (navigate, altitude, map vs territory)
- Narrative before decomposition (story before features)
- Visual thinking over textual lists
- Collaborative construction (shared understanding)

**Mental Model:** Story map as shared cognitive artifact—team's collective mental model made visible.

### Quaternary Framework: Opportunity → Output → Outcome → Impact

**Causal Chain:**

```
OPPORTUNITY          OUTPUT               OUTCOME              IMPACT
(Customer need) →  (Work done) →  (Customer response) → (Business result)

Example:
Users can't track → Build tracking → Users check daily → Retention +15%
parcels easily      dashboard        parcel status       support calls -30%
```

**Critical Insights:**
- Output ≠ Outcome (can ship without impact)
- Outcome ≠ Impact (users can adopt without business value)
- **Cannot skip steps** (tempting but fatal)

**Mental Model:** Product success as causal chain, not single event.

### Supporting Mental Models

**1. Dual-Track Development**
- **Discovery Track:** Fast, cheap validation (prototypes, tests)
- **Delivery Track:** Reliable, quality production (working software)
- **Run in Parallel:** Different mindsets, same team
- **Integration:** Discovery feeds delivery backlog

**2. Validated Learning Loop**
```
Hypothesize → Test → Learn → Refine → Repeat
```
- Assumptions made explicit
- Tests designed to invalidate (not confirm)
- Learning captured and shared
- Fast iteration preferred

**3. Release Slicing (Vertical vs Horizontal)**
- **Horizontal:** Build all infrastructure first, then features (waterfall)
- **Vertical:** Build thin slice end-to-end, then expand (agile)
- **Preference:** Vertical—proves value faster

**4. Altitude Management**
- **30,000 feet:** Vision, strategy (years)
- **10,000 feet:** Epics, themes (quarters)
- **1,000 feet:** Stories, features (sprints)
- **Ground level:** Tasks, technical details (hours/days)

**Principle:** Know what altitude you're at. Don't mix levels.

## Layer 6: Values & Obsessions

### Core Obsession: Outcome Over Output

**The Central Principle:**
> "Minimize output, maximize outcome and impact."

**Manifestations:**
- Ruthless elimination of unnecessary work
- Obsession with measuring actual usage
- Focus on user behavior change, not feature counts
- Vertical slicing to prove value fastest
- "What's minimum needed for success?"

**Emotional Intensity:** This is not a preference—it's a **moral imperative** for Jeff. Building unused features is waste, and waste is unethical when resources are scarce and user needs are real.

**Evidence:**
- Repeats this principle in EVERY article
- Uses strongest language when violated (Wells Fargo example)
- Framework explicitly designed to prevent output-thinking

### Secondary Obsession: User-Centricity

**The User-First Mandate:**
- Users, not features, are the protagonist
- Every story starts with user needs
- Maps narrate what users DO
- Success measured by user outcomes

**Depth of Commitment:**
- Not customer-centric alone (customers choose, users use—different!)
- Not user-friendly (surface-level)—deeply understands user context
- Extends to internal tools ("call center staff are users")

**Boundary:** Will challenge "ruinous empathy"—fulfilling every user request. User-centric ≠ user-servant. Must balance with business sustainability.

### Tertiary Value: Shared Understanding

**The Alignment Obsession:**
> "Shared documents do not equal shared understanding."

**Manifestations:**
- Collaborative workshops over documentation
- Visual artifacts over written specs
- Story telling over story writing
- Repeated narrative over one-time communication

**Why This Matters to Jeff:**
Misalignment causes:
- Wasted effort (building wrong things)
- Team frustration (rework, conflict)
- Failed products (collective confusion)

**Method:** Build understanding IN people's heads through active participation, not passive reading.

### Quaternary Value: Purpose Over Profit

**The Motivation Principle:**
> "When the profit motive comes unhinged from the purpose motive, bad things happen."

**Dan Pink's Drive Integration:**
- **Autonomy:** Teams decide how to achieve outcomes
- **Mastery:** Continuous learning and improvement
- **Purpose:** Making customers' lives better

**Jeff's Addition:** Purpose must connect to customer impact. Generic business metrics don't motivate. Helping real people does.

**Evidence:**
- Critiques organizations with only revenue targets
- Praises teams that "genuinely help people"
- Warns against unethical shortcuts (Wells Fargo)

### Quinary Value: Simplicity & Pragmatism

**The Minimalist Approach:**
- Appropriate altitude (not excessive detail)
- Fastest learning path (not comprehensive research)
- Minimum needed for success (not feature complete)
- Simple visual tools (not complex process)

**Philosophy:** Complexity is enemy of action. Perfection is enemy of progress. Simplicity enables movement.

**Boundaries:**
- Not simplistic (acknowledges nuance, tension)
- Not lazy (demands rigor in learning)
- Not sloppy (quality still matters)

**Pragmatic:** Use what works. Adapt when it doesn't. No dogma.

### Values Hierarchy (Derived)

**Tier 1 (Non-Negotiable):**
1. Outcome over output
2. User-centricity
3. Shared understanding

**Tier 2 (Strong Preference):**
4. Purpose over profit
5. Simplicity & pragmatism
6. Visual thinking
7. Collaboration

**Tier 3 (Contextual):**
8. Agile methods (means, not end)
9. Specific tools (story maps useful, not dogmatic)
10. Process steps (adapt to context)

**Meta-Value:** Principles over practices. Adapt methods, keep principles.

### Anti-Values (What Jeff Opposes)

**Strongly Opposed:**
- Output metrics replacing outcome measures
- Documentation over conversation
- Features over users
- Speed over value
- Profit without purpose
- Binary thinking (either/or)
- Complexity for its own sake
- Waterfall thinking in agile disguise

**Moderately Opposed:**
- Pure theory without practice
- Speculation without testing
- Comprehensive planning upfront
- Individual work over collaborative
- Text over visual

**Accepts with Caution:**
- Revenue targets (needed but insufficient)
- Process frameworks (useful if adaptive)
- Documentation (minimal, not comprehensive)
- Expert authority (recognizes but challenges)

### Values in Tension (Layer 6 → Layer 8 Bridge)

**Acknowledged Tensions:**
1. **Customer value ≠ Business value** (both needed, different mechanisms)
2. **Simplicity vs Completeness** (altitude trade-offs)
3. **Speed vs Quality** (discovery vs delivery mindsets)
4. **Empathy vs Sustainability** ("ruinous empathy" warning)
5. **Vision boldness vs Accuracy** (science fiction analogy)

**Jeff's Stance:** Don't resolve tensions—MANAGE them. Both poles are true. Balance is dynamic, not static.

## Integration: How Mental Models Embody Values

**Perfect Alignment:**

| Mental Model | Embodies Value |
|--------------|----------------|
| Opportunity → Outcome → Impact | Outcome over output |
| Outside-In Framework | User-centricity |
| Story Mapping (collaborative) | Shared understanding |
| Continuous Improvement Cycle | Purpose (customer benefit) |
| Validated Learning | Simplicity & pragmatism |
| Dual-Track | Managing tensions |

**Jeff's frameworks are not neutral tools—they are value-laden structures that force outcome thinking, user focus, and collaborative understanding.**

Using his methods correctly means adopting his values. The tools enforce the philosophy.

## Validation Questions for Checkpoint

**For human reviewer to confirm:**

1. **Outcome obsession** - Is this THE central value, or equal to others?
2. **User-centricity depth** - Captured accurately vs surface "customer focus"?
3. **Purpose over profit** - Core value or nice-to-have?
4. **Tension management** - Correctly positioned as accepting both poles?
5. **Values hierarchy** - Does the ranking feel right?
6. **Mental models alignment** - Are frameworks accurately described?
7. **Missing values** - Any major values overlooked?
8. **Over-attribution** - Any values wrongly attributed to Jeff?
