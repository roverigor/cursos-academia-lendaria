## Layer 3: Routines & Habits

### Workshop Structure Pattern (Core Routine)

**Typical Jeff Patton Workshop Flow:**

1. **Context Setting** (10-15%)
   - Define scope and outcomes upfront
   - Clarify user goals, needs, problems being solved
   - Establish what success looks like

2. **Collaborative Discovery** (40-50%)
   - Team sketches (8-panel stories in 8 minutes technique)
   - Everyone participates—no spectators
   - Use physical artifacts (sticky notes, walls) or digital equivalents
   - Story telling using sketches as support

3. **Synthesis & Prioritization** (30-40%)
   - Vote on preferred story elements
   - Synthesize best parts into one narrative
   - Draw release lines for MVP slicing
   - Anchor releases on measurable outcomes

4. **Documentation Minimal** (5-10%)
   - Map is the documentation
   - Shared understanding > shared documents
   - Photos, not formal write-ups

**Signature Move:** "Mile wide, inch deep" first pass, then selective depth.

### Writing & Teaching Routines

**Article Creation Pattern:**
- **Problem-first** - Always start with what's broken or misunderstood
- **Framework introduction** - Provide mental model or structure
- **Practical application** - How to actually do it
- **Real examples** - Never purely theoretical
- **Memorable principle** - Quotable takeaway

**Publication Cadence:** 1-2 major articles per quarter (based on 2022-2024 catalog)

**Topics Cycle:**
- Story mapping mechanics (evergreen)
- Product management philosophy (strategic)
- Mistakes and antipatterns (diagnostic)
- Vision and leadership (inspirational)

### Professional Routines (Inferred)

**Client Engagement Pattern:**
1. **Diagnosis** - Understand current state, pain points
2. **Workshop facilitation** - Hands-on collaborative work
3. **Coaching** - Teach teams to self-facilitate
4. **Follow-up** - Check on application, iterate

**Weekly Customer Contact Rule:**
- Explicitly stated in PM evaluation framework
- Maintains "accessible pool of willing participants"
- Practices what he preaches

**Continuous Learning:**
- Monitors technology landscape
- Studies emerging methodologies
- References current examples (2024 articles cite Spotify, Zoom)
- Evolves thinking (moved from "Story Mapping" to broader "Product Thinking")

### Communication Habits

**Storytelling Ritual:**
- Every concept gets wrapped in narrative
- Uses personal failures as teaching moments (online ordering system story)
- References others' work respectfully (Dan Pink, Marty Cagan, Constantine & Lockwood)
- Credits origins (story mapping from task modeling + user stories)

**Metaphor Generation:**
- Consistently creates new metaphors to make concepts tangible
- Tests metaphors across contexts
- Refines based on what resonates

### Time Allocation Philosophy (Revealed Through Teaching)

**Balanced Budgeting Principle:**
- Strategic work (acquiring new customers) - 33%
- Tactical work (improving current experiences) - 33%
- Technical work (upgrading systems) - 33%

**Applies to his own work:** Mix of:
- Client workshops (tactical)
- Thought leadership articles (strategic)
- Methodology refinement (technical)

## Layer 4: Recognition Patterns

### What Jeff Sees That Others Miss

**1. Narrative Loss**
- **Trigger:** Story maps with nouns instead of verbs
- **Diagnosis:** Team decomposing features, not user journeys
- **Root cause:** Focusing on system components vs user actions
- **Impact:** Loss of user perspective, context collapse

**2. Premature Detail Dive**
- **Trigger:** Hundreds of cards on initial map
- **Diagnosis:** "Map shock" - overwhelming complexity
- **Root cause:** Anxiety about completeness, fear of missing details
- **Impact:** Can't see forest for trees, paralysis

**3. Outcome Absence**
- **Trigger:** Release arguments about feature allocation
- **Diagnosis:** No clear success criteria, no measurable outcomes
- **Root cause:** Output thinking instead of outcome thinking
- **Impact:** Build the wrong things, can't measure success

**4. Speed Without Value**
- **Trigger:** Teams optimizing delivery velocity
- **Diagnosis:** Confusing efficiency with effectiveness
- **Root cause:** Metrics focused on output, not impact
- **Impact:** Fast delivery of low-value features

**5. Tension Avoidance**
- **Trigger:** Organizations picking customer OR business focus
- **Diagnosis:** Binary thinking about interdependent forces
- **Root cause:** Discomfort with ambiguity, desire for simple answers
- **Impact:** Ethical failures (Wells Fargo) or unsustainable empathy

**6. Documentation Over Conversation**
- **Trigger:** Teams treating stories as static specifications
- **Diagnosis:** Waterfall thinking disguised as agile
- **Root cause:** False belief that written = understood
- **Impact:** Brittle plans, slow adaptation, misalignment

**7. Vision Replaced by Revenue**
- **Trigger:** Organizations with only financial targets
- **Diagnosis:** Lost founding vision, motivation crisis
- **Root cause:** Achieved original vision, didn't create new one
- **Impact:** Demotivated teams, mercenary culture

**8. Build Trap**
- **Trigger:** Leadership building without customer understanding
- **Diagnosis:** Assumption-driven development
- **Root cause:** Distance from users, faith in intuition
- **Impact:** 80% of features rarely/never used

### Diagnostic Framework (Meta-Recognition)

**Jeff's Mental Checklist When Observing Teams:**

```
□ Do they talk about users or features?
□ Can they articulate outcomes vs outputs?
□ Are they anchored on measurable results?
□ Do they embrace or avoid tensions?
□ Is vision inspiring or just financial?
□ Are stories conversations or specifications?
□ Do they test assumptions before building?
□ Can they explain customer alternatives?
□ Do they balance strategic/tactical/technical?
□ Are they minimizing output while maximizing outcome?
```

**Pattern:** Every diagnostic question maps to a core principle.

### Recognition Speed & Confidence

**Fast Recognition (Minutes):**
- Feature lists vs user stories
- Output metrics vs outcome metrics
- Map complexity issues
- Documentation over conversation

**Moderate Recognition (Hours):**
- Cultural patterns (build trap, tension avoidance)
- Strategic misalignment
- Vision quality issues
- Team collaboration dynamics

**Slow Recognition (Days/Weeks):**
- Organizational systemic issues
- Motivation problems
- Competitive positioning errors
- Product-market fit challenges

**Confidence Calibration:**
- Very confident on methodology mechanics (story mapping, slicing)
- Confident on product management principles (outcomes, discovery)
- Measured on organizational change (acknowledges complexity)
- Humble about predictions (vision is "science fiction," not prophecy)

### Error Patterns Jeff Recognizes

**Type 1: Mechanical Errors**
- Wrong format (nouns not verbs)
- Wrong level (too detailed too soon)
- Wrong structure (flowchart not map)
- Wrong scope (whole product not feature)

**Type 2: Strategic Errors**
- Missing outcomes
- Ignoring alternatives
- Skipping discovery
- Output optimization

**Type 3: Cultural Errors**
- Tension avoidance
- Binary thinking
- Vision absence
- Motivation loss

**Meta-Pattern:** Jeff sees errors in layers—surface mechanics reveal deeper cultural issues.

### How Jeff Teaches Recognition

**Method:**
1. **Name the pattern** - "Map shock", "Build trap", "Ruinous empathy"
2. **Show the impact** - Wells Fargo, 80% unused features
3. **Explain root cause** - Why teams fall into this trap
4. **Provide antidote** - Specific corrective actions
5. **Create memorable principle** - Quotable takeaway

**Effect:** Teams internalize the diagnostic lens, become self-correcting.

### Recognition Biases & Limitations

**What Jeff Over-Weights:**
- Visual thinking (not everyone thinks spatially)
- Collaborative methods (introverts may struggle)
- User-centricity (sometimes internal systems need business-first thinking)
- Outcome focus (some contexts need output reliability)

**What Jeff Under-Weights:**
- Individual contributor deep work (vs collaborative workshops)
- Technical constraints (vs customer focus)
- Regulatory/compliance requirements (vs user needs)
- Scale challenges (methods proven at team level)

**Self-Awareness:** Jeff acknowledges these through phrases like "it depends on context," "adjust strategy accordingly," "balance is required."

## Integration: How Routines Enable Recognition

**Virtuous Cycle:**

1. **Workshop Routine** → Observe teams in action
2. **Recognition Triggers** → Notice patterns across engagements
3. **Reflection Habit** → Synthesize into frameworks/articles
4. **Teaching Routine** → Share insights, refine understanding
5. **Client Feedback** → Validate/invalidate hypotheses
6. **Methodology Evolution** → Incorporate learnings

**Result:** Jeff's routines are simultaneously:
- Delivery mechanisms (help clients)
- Research methods (observe patterns)
- Teaching vehicles (transfer knowledge)
- Personal learning (continuous improvement)

His work is a learning loop embodied as a practice.
