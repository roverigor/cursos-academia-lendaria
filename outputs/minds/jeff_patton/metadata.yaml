# Notes
notes: |
  Jeff Patton is the creator of User Story Mapping methodology, a visual approach to
  breaking down complex product requirements into manageable user-centric tasks. His
  methodology is perfect for decomposing PRDs and documentation into smaller activities.

  Key characteristics:
  - Visual thinker (story mapping is inherently visual)
  - User-centric focus (always starts with users, not features)
  - Iterative/incremental approach (build slice by slice)
  - Strong UX background (combines Agile + UX thinking)
  - Pragmatic communicator (practical, not theoretical)
