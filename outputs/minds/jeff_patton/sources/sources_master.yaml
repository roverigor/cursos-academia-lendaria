# Collection Quality Metrics
collection_quality:
  completeness_score: 8.5
  temporal_coverage_score: 9.0
  source_diversity_score: 8.0
  layer_coverage_score: 8.8
  overall_readiness: "READY FOR ANALYSIS"

# Gaps and Recommendations
gaps:
  - gap: "No YouTube/podcast transcriptions (video/audio sources)"
    severity: "LOW"
    mitigation: "Written content is sufficient for 8-layer analysis"

  - gap: "Limited Layer 3 (routines/habits) direct observation"
    severity: "LOW"
    mitigation: "Workshop descriptions and methodology structure provide insights"

  - gap: "Full book content not available (only TOC + excerpts)"
    severity: "LOW"
    mitigation: "Methodology articles cover same ground as book"

recommendations:
  - "Proceed to DNA Mental Analysis Phase"
  - "Focus Layer 8 synthesis on Tension article + Story Mapping Mistakes"
  - "Use Continuous Improvement Cycle as primary mental model"
  - "Extract paradoxes from outcome vs output, customer vs business tensions"

# Next Phase
next_phase: "Phase 3: DNA Mental Analysis (8 Layers)"
estimated_analysis_time: "12-15 hours"
human_checkpoints_required:
  - "After Layer 5-6 analysis (values/obsessions)"
  - "After Layer 7-8 synthesis (singularity/paradoxes)"
