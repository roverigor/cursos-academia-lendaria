## Overview

Marty Cagan's article introduces Dual-Track Agile as a methodology addressing common Agile team challenges, including lengthy sprint planning, slow velocity, and excessive rework due to poorly validated backlog items.

## Core Concept

The approach operates on two parallel tracks:

**Discovery Track**: Rapidly generates validated product backlog items through collaborative exploration and prototyping.

**Delivery Track**: Produces releasable software based on validated requirements.

## Key Principles

The methodology emphasizes validating ideas "the fastest, cheapest way possible" before committing to production development. Rather than waterfall-style handoffs between product managers, designers, and engineers, Dual-Track Agile requires these roles working collaboratively side-by-side.

## Integration with Lean UX

The article highlights synergy between Dual-Track Agile and Lean UX practices. Instead of formal artifacts, teams create prototypes for validation during Discovery, with prototypes serving as specifications for the Delivery phase.

## Validation Timing

A critical distinction: validation occurs during Discovery, not after release. Teams can frequently validate concepts before writing production code—exemplifying the principle of "fake it before you make it."

## Important Update

Cagan later abandoned the "Dual-Track Agile" terminology, finding it misdirected focus toward process rather than principles. He now uses "Continuous Discovery" and "Continuous Delivery" instead.
