## Core Definition

According to Jeff Patton, product vision is fundamentally different from what many organizations believe it to be. Rather than revenue targets or feature lists, vision represents "imagining a future world with your product in it and telling a story about how people will experience your product(s) in that future."

## Key Characteristics of Effective Vision

### What Vision Is
- A narrative about future product experiences
- Meant to inspire and align teams working on products
- Requires shared understanding, not just documents
- Emotional and motivational in nature
- Rooted in long-range outcome thinking

### What Vision Is NOT
- A specification or implementation plan
- A business goal or growth target
- Accurate or immediately feasible
- A "vision statement" or elevator pitch template
- A mission statement (which describes organizational purpose)
- A product positioning statement (which describes current market fit)

## The Science Fiction Analogy

Vision functions similarly to science fiction—it paints a future that likely won't occur exactly as imagined, yet serves a crucial purpose. Historical examples like Apple's 1987 vision video predicted tablets, video calling, and AI assistants that seemed impossible at the time but became reality within 10-20 years.

The videos intentionally look "futuristic and outdated simultaneously," embracing boldness while accepting imperfection.

## Inspiring and Aligning Teams

For vision to motivate people, it must exist "in people's heads" through repeated storytelling, not document repositories. Leaders must actively tell and retell vision narratives. SpaceX exemplifies this—Elon Musk's persistent communication about Mars colonization creates alignment without formal visiontypes.

Shared documents do not equal shared understanding.

## Practical Recipe for Creating Vision

### 1. Set Your Time Horizon
Anchor vision to a specific future point—2, 5, or 10 years ahead. Shorter horizons suit high-uncertainty environments; longer ones work for established products with clearer trajectories.

### 2. Describe the Future World
Imagine future conditions across relevant dimensions:
- **Technology**: What innovations emerge?
- **Social**: How will people interact?
- **Political**: What regulatory changes matter?
- **Environmental**: How do ecological factors affect your space?
- **Economic**: What financial trends are relevant?
- **Intersections**: Where do trends collide?

### 3. Consider Your Organization's Future
Identify current competitive advantages and how they'll evolve. Consider current investments and their future manifestations.

### 4. Tell the Future Product Story

**Identify characters**: Define target customers, their goals, and their activities through lightweight proto-personas.

**Ideate collaboratively**:
- Share beliefs about the future
- Have team members sketch 8-panel stories in 8 minutes
- Tell stories using sketches as support
- Vote on preferred story elements
- Synthesize best parts into one narrative

### 5. Communicate Your Story
Use multiple formats to build shared understanding:
- Written narratives or scenarios
- Story maps
- Comic-style storyboards
- UI sketches with descriptions
- Future press releases
- Short videos
- Bodystorming (acting out scenarios)
- Creative blends of these approaches

## Vision in Organizational Context

Many established organizations have achieved their founding vision, leaving them searching for purpose. In these situations, revenue targets replace inspiration—a significant loss for team motivation.

If vision is missing or unclear, product leaders should co-create vision collaboratively with leadership and teams, ensuring alignment with organizational direction while contextualizing vision for specific product areas.

## The Leadership Imperative

Unless you're the founder, you inherit organizational vision and must "adapt the vision you inherited and make it real for the specific product or product area you manage." This requires developing storytelling skills and creating narratives that contextualize broader vision for your teams.

The goal remains constant: build shared understanding that inspires teams to make the imagined future real.
