## The Core Concept

The simplest answer to "what is a product?" is everything. Any offering—physical goods, services, software, or internal work—becomes a product when viewed through a product thinking lens.

## Understanding Products: Types and Examples

Products exist in multiple forms:

- **Physical goods**: Toothpaste, lightbulbs, refrigerators
- **Consumer services**: Netflix, Spotify subscriptions
- **Financial services**: Bank accounts, credit cards, insurance policies
- **Utilities**: Power, water, mobile phone service
- **Software**: Cloud-based applications delivered continuously as services

The critical insight: *"What's most important about products isn't what's inside: those features and benefits. It's what's outside."*

## The Outside-In Framework

### Key External Elements

**Customers and Users**
- *Customers* (choosers) decide whether to purchase or subscribe
- *Users* actually utilize the product to gain value
- In B2C contexts, these roles often overlap
- In B2B contexts, they're typically different people

**Value Proposition**
The perceived benefit customers expect when choosing a product. Success depends on whether users actually achieve this value through consistent use.

**Alternatives**
Options available to meet the same needs, including:
- Competing products
- Workaround solutions
- Manual processes
- Accepting the problem as-is

**Organizational Context**
- Vision: Long-term organizational direction
- Strategy: Step-by-step path forward
- Metrics: Measuring use, efficiency, and value realization

## Applying Product Thinking Broadly

### Example: Internal Legal Services

A corporate lawyer providing contract reviews and risk assessment can adopt product thinking by:
- Identifying internal clients as customers
- Understanding how legal work gets used
- Measuring whether guidance was actually implemented
- Evaluating success by outcomes, not output volume

### Example: Internal Technology Tools

Teams building call center software should:
- Recognize call center staff as users and operations managers as customers
- Focus on productivity improvements rather than feature quantity
- Minimize output while maximizing value
- Track usage metrics and operational efficiency

## Avoiding the Build Trap

Two common failure modes emerge:

1. **Leadership trap**: Building without understanding customer needs, ignoring outcomes post-release
2. **Team trap**: Assuming decisions are made elsewhere; optimizing for delivery speed over value creation

Both undermine product success.

## Putting on Your Product Hat

Ask these questions about any initiative:

- Who are the customers and choosers?
- Who actually uses what gets created?
- Do usage metrics show adoption and effectiveness?
- How does use ultimately deliver value?
- What's your vision for users' future state?
- What's your strategy for reaching that vision?

## The Fundamental Principle

*"Minimize output, maximize outcome and impact."*

Success comes from focusing on whether customers choose your product, whether users actually employ it, and whether that usage creates measurable value—not from the volume of features delivered.
