## Overview

Jeff Patton describes a foundational model for product development consisting of four interconnected phases: Sense, Focus, Discover, and Deliver. This framework explains how organizations continuously improve products to remain competitive in today's tech-driven market.

## Why Tech Products Are Different

Traditional physical products typically follow an **obsolescence model**, where companies retire old versions and replace them with new ones (e.g., "2.0" releases). Software products, however, operate differently.

Since cloud computing became ubiquitous, most software companies abandoned the release-and-replace approach. Instead, they continuously enhance existing products through frequent feature additions and improvements. Companies like Spotify, Zoom, and Microsoft Word exemplify this pattern—there is no "Spotify 2.0" coming; the platform evolves perpetually.

> "As tech product consumers we've come to expect our products to continuously improve without having to replace or rebuy them."

Tech products—defined as any product where software plays a substantial role—now dominate markets. Cars, phones, and smart home devices all contain firmware and software that update regularly, creating user expectations for ongoing improvement.

## The Four Phases of Continuous Improvement

### 1. **Sense: Listen and Learn**

Organizations must actively observe customers and markets across three dimensions:

**Tactical Sensing** focuses on current user behavior through interviews, analytics, support data, social media, and satisfaction surveys. Simple practices like tracking effort-to-outcome ratios help teams identify customer problems.

**Strategic Sensing** targets potential customers—those who rejected the product, abandoned it, or weren't addressed by current solutions. Growth requires understanding unmet needs in markets the company doesn't yet serve.

**Technical Sensing** monitors the evolving technology landscape. Teams must continuously evaluate underlying architecture and emerging tools that could strengthen the product.

### 2. **Focus: Prioritize with Vision and Strategy**

With an overwhelming mountain of opportunities identified through sensing, organizations must focus deliberately:

- **Vision and Strategy**: Vision articulates how customers might use the product years ahead; strategy outlines steps toward that vision. Both center on observable customer behavior and organizational sustainability.

- **Target Outcomes**: Rather than focusing on specific features, teams identify measurable changes in customer behavior they aim to achieve. OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) effectively package target outcomes.

- **Balanced Budgeting**: Teams must allocate time across three equally important priorities: strategic work (acquiring new customers), tactical work (improving current experiences), and technical work (upgrading underlying systems). Neglecting any area creates long-term problems.

> "It's up to teams to budget a percentage of their time on strategic, tactical, and technical change every quarter."

### 3. **Discover: Analyze, Design, and Test**

Discovery work reduces risk before full-scale investment:

**Consider Many Ideas**: Initial concepts rarely prove best. Ideation generates multiple options worth exploring.

**Acknowledge Failure Rates**: Research shows that "80 percent of features in the average software product are rarely or never used." Most product improvements don't achieve intended outcomes.

**Validated Learning**: Teams expose their assumptions about customers, user behavior, outcomes, and business impact. Using hypothesis testing, they ask:
1. What must we learn to validate our assumptions?
2. What's the fastest way to learn this?

The validated learning loop—making sense, testing, learning—forms discovery's heartbeat. Once confidence builds that the solution will generate desired outcomes, teams move forward with building at scale.

### 4. **Deliver: Build and Release**

Delivery focuses on building solutions as quickly, predictably, and reliably as possible. Agile practices like Scrum support this phase through:

- **Fixed timeboxes** (sprints, typically two weeks)
- **Fixed team size** (controlling costs, since people costs dominate software development)
- **Fixed scope** (agreed at sprint start)
- **Velocity measurement** (tracking actual work completed)
- **Quality review** (demonstrating completed work and assessing quality)

> "During delivery we focus on speed, predictability, and quality."

## Integration and Ongoing Work

These phases don't function sequentially. Organizations operate in all four simultaneously:

- Continuous sensing feeds awareness
- Constant focus recalibration shifts priorities
- Ongoing discovery tests ideas before investment
- Relentless pressure drives delivery acceleration

As organizations grow, responsibility shifts. Leadership emphasizes vision and strategy; research focuses on emerging opportunities; technical leads address architecture. Teams balance discovery and delivery work—a pattern called dual-track development.

## Critical Competitive Question

Organizations must ask themselves: **"How fast must our products evolve and improve to stay competitive?"**

Understanding where bottlenecks exist within this four-phase cycle reveals where to focus improvement efforts—often not in delivery speed, where many organizations assume problems lie.
