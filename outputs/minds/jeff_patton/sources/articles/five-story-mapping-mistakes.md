## Overview

Jeff Patton identifies five critical errors teams make when creating and working with story maps. Rather than serving as precise technical diagrams, story maps should communicate user narratives through visual organization.

## Mistake 1: Losing the Story

**The Problem**: Many teams create feature decompositions rather than actual story maps. These maps list nouns describing system components instead of capturing user actions.

**The Solution**: Focus on identifying users, establishing a clear beginning and end, then narrate what those users *do*. Each sticky note should contain a verb phrase representing a step in their journey, not a system feature.

## Mistake 2: Getting Lost in Details

**The Problem**: Breaking every step into granular sub-steps creates "map shock"—overwhelming complexity with potentially hundreds of cards that obscure the overall narrative.

**The Solution**: Maintain appropriate altitude. Progress horizontally from start to finish before descending into detail. Think "mile wide, inch deep" initially. Stay at a useful level of abstraction.

## Mistake 3: Overcomplicating Flow, Branches, and Conditions

**The Problem**: Teams attempt converting story maps into flowcharts by adding multiple branches and parallel paths, which undermines the vertical axis reserved for decomposition.

**The Solution**: Choose a typical flow left-to-right, then explain variations verbally: "usually users do X, then Y, but some skip to Z." Keep the structure flat. When multiple users act simultaneously, present them sequentially while explaining they happen concurrently.

## Mistake 4: Mapping the Entire Product for Single Features

**The Problem**: Developers resist story mapping, believing they must map whole products when adding individual features.

**The Solution**: Map only the new feature. Start where users first encounter it; end when they successfully use it. Optionally, reference a high-level product backbone to identify potential impacts across configuration areas, dashboards, or reports.

## Mistake 5: Failing to Anchor Releases on Outcomes

**The Problem**: Teams argue about feature allocation and fill releases to capacity without clear success criteria.

**The Solution**: For each release, identify target users and articulate 1-2 sentences describing how their capabilities improve. Define measurable outcomes: What becomes faster? Better? Determine metrics proving improvement. Then ruthlessly eliminate anything unnecessary for achieving those outcomes. Use vertical slicing to split features minimally: "What's minimum needed for success? What defers later?"

**Key Principle**: When releases anchor to measurable user outcomes rather than feature counts, each iteration becomes demonstrably smaller and more successful than anticipated.
