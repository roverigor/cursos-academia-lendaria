    notes: |
      Jeff Patton has excellent source availability:
      - Primary source (book) is comprehensive and authoritative
      - Rich conference talk history shows evolution over time
      - Multiple interview formats provide deep values/obsession insights
      - Story mapping methodology itself makes Layer 7 (singularity) very clear
      - Layer 8 (paradoxes) should emerge from structure vs flexibility tension

      This is an ideal candidate for high-fidelity cognitive cloning.
