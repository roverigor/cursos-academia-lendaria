**Key Finding:**

Yuval Noah Harari is an **exceptionally viable candidate** for MMOS mind mapping with the "AI: Future of Humanity Advisor" use case. With 93% APEX score and 96% ICP match, this represents one of the highest viability scores possible. Harari combines world-class source availability, global recognition, master storytelling, perfect temporal relevance (Nexus 2024), and ideal alignment with AI trends. The only minor weakness is tactical specificity (60%), which is expected and acceptable for a macro-historical philosopher rather than a tactical consultant.

**Critical Differentiator:** Layer 8 "AI Safety Advocate + Acceleration Observer" paradox is extractable and will provide authentic human depth.
