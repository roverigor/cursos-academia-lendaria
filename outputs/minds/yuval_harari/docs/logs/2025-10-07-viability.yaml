      threshold_auto_approve: ">=75"

      decision: APPROVE
      rationale: "93% APEX score indicates exceptional viability. World-class availability (20/20), perfect public persona (15/15), outstanding X-factor (15/15), and ideal temporal relevance (15/15). Only weakness is tactical specificity (9/15), which is acceptable for a philosopher/historian focused on macro perspectives rather than implementation details."

strengths:
  - "45M books sold, global bestseller status"
  - "Perfect availability across all content types"
  - "Globally recognized by world leaders (Obama, Gates)"
  - "Master storyteller with unique interdisciplinary synthesis"
  - "Perfect timing: AI expertise in AI era"
  - "Active and producing (Nexus 2024)"

weaknesses:
  - "More strategic/philosophical than tactical/actionable"
  - "Limited step-by-step implementation frameworks"
  - "Some academic criticism of scientific accuracy"
  - "Contrarian views may be polarizing"

opportunities:
  - "AI safety/acceleration paradox (potential Layer 8)"
  - "Extensive source material available"
  - "Cross-domain expertise enables rich cognitive architecture"
  - "Perfect alignment with 'AI: Future of Humanity' use case"

risks:
  - "Rapidly evolving AI field may date specific predictions"
  - "Philosophical rather than technical AI expertise"
  - "Polarizing views may limit certain audiences"
