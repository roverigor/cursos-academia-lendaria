## Critical Reminders

**HUMAN CHECKPOINTS (Non-Negotiable):**
1. ✅ Post-Research: Source requirements validation
2. ⏸️ Layer 6: Values hierarchy validation
3. ⏸️ Layer 7: Obsessions validation
4. ⏸️ Layer 8: Paradoxes validation (MOST CRITICAL)
5. ⏸️ System Prompt: Completeness review
6. ⏸️ Production: Final approval (fidelity >94%)

**LAYER 8 FOCUS:**
- AI Safety Advocate + Acceleration Observer paradox
- This is THE differentiator - without it, clone feels robotic
- Must have 3+ sources of evidence
- Contextual resolution must be clear

**QUALITY THRESHOLDS:**
- Triangulation: ≥70% agreement (Layers 5-8)
- Fidelity: ≥94% (≥8.5/10 blind testing)
- Source coverage: ≥50 sources, ≥12 Tier 1
- Human checkpoints: All 6 passed

**STORYTELLING PRESERVATION:**
- Harari's voice is his signature
- Extract 50+ signature phrases
- Deep linguistic analysis required
- Narrative flow > factual listing
