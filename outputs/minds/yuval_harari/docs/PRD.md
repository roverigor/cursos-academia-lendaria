**Frameworks:**
1. **Collective Fiction Theory** - Money, religion, nations as shared myths that enable cooperation
2. **Information Networks Framework** - How information flow shapes power structures (Nexus)
3. **AI as Alien Intelligence** - First technology that can take power away from us
4. **Three Revolutions Model** - Cognitive → Agricultural → Scientific → AI
