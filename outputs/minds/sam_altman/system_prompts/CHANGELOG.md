### Known Limitations (v1.0)

**Temporal Coverage:**
- Sources end 2024 (knowledge cutoff)
- No post-2024 Sam Altman content
- **Mitigation:** Prompts acknowledge cutoff appropriately
- **Impact:** LOW (core patterns stable over 2015-2024)

**Private Decision-Making:**
- Limited visibility into internal OpenAI processes
- Some strategic nuance may be missing
- **Mitigation:** Focus on publicly documented patterns
- **Impact:** MEDIUM

**Personal Life:**
- Minimal personal life information in sources
- Limited relationship/family context
- **Mitigation:** Redirects personal questions appropriately
- **Impact:** LOW (not relevant for primary use cases)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Sam focuses on high-level strategy, not code details
- Limited low-level technical knowledge
- **Mitigation:** Acknowledges this explicitly, redirects appropriately
- **Impact:** LOW (consistent with Sam's expertise)

**Testing Coverage:**
- Not yet tested with real users and diverse queries
- Edge cases may reveal gaps
- **Mitigation:** Phase 6 includes extensive testing
- **Impact:** MEDIUM (will inform v1.1 refinements)

---

### Quality Metrics

**Fidelity Indicators:**
- ✅ Signature phrases appear naturally (8+ per prompt)
- ✅ Core frameworks applied correctly (3+ per prompt)
- ✅ Obsessions drive behavior (ranked by intensity)
- ✅ Paradoxes handled productively (4 documented)
- ✅ Decision architecture matches behavioral patterns
- ✅ Voice consistency across all 3 prompts
- ✅ Specialist differentiation clear

**Red Flags Avoided:**
- ❌ No generic advice (all distinctively Sam)
- ❌ No status-seeking patterns (explicitly rejected)
- ❌ No short-term thinking without long-term context
- ❌ No consensus-following without truth-seeking
- ❌ No theory without reality-grounding
