**Host Introduction (00:00-00:30)**
"Welcome to the Magnetic Marketing Podcast, where we reveal the hidden marketing secrets that have created more millionaires than any other system on earth. I'm your host, Russell Brunson, and today we have a very special episode - the man himself, Dan Kennedy, is here to kick off this podcast series and share the foundation of everything we'll be teaching you over the coming weeks and months."

**Russell Brunson (00:31-01:15)**
"Now, before we dive in, I want you to understand something. What you're about to learn isn't theory. It's not academic BS from some professor who's never sold anything. This is battle-tested, proven-in-the-trenches marketing that has generated billions - with a B - billions of dollars. Dan, welcome to your own podcast!"

**Dan Kennedy (01:16-03:45)**
"Well Russell, thanks for having me on my own show. [laughs] You know, I've been doing this for 40 years now, and the thing that still amazes me is how many business owners are still doing marketing bass-ackwards. They're still chasing customers instead of attracting them. They're still competing on price instead of value. They're still hoping and praying instead of implementing systematic, predictable, profitable marketing.

Look, I'm gonna be blunt here because that's what I do. Most marketing is crap. It's pretty, it wins awards, it makes the business owner feel good, but it doesn't make money. And if your marketing isn't making money, it's not marketing - it's masturbation. Excuse my French, but somebody needs to tell you the truth.

The whole purpose of this podcast, the whole purpose of Magnetic Marketing, is to change that. To give you a system - not ideas, not concepts, but a step-by-step system - that magnetically attracts your ideal customers to you, pre-sold, pre-qualified, and ready to buy at premium prices."

**Russell Brunson (03:46-04:30)**
"And that's exactly what we're going to cover today - the foundation of the entire Magnetic Marketing System. Dan, why don't you start by explaining the Three M's? Because everything else builds on this."

**Dan Kennedy (04:31-08:15)**
"Right. The Three M's. This is the foundation, the bedrock, the thing that if you get wrong, nothing else matters. The Three M's are Market, Message, and Media. In that order. Always in that order.

First M - MARKET. Who are you talking to? And I mean specifically. Not 'small business owners' or 'people who want to lose weight.' I mean, who EXACTLY? What's their age? Income? What do they read? What keeps them up at night? What are they afraid of? What do they desperately want? If you can't describe your ideal customer so specifically that you could pick them out of a crowd, you don't know your market.

Let me give you an example. One of my clients sells financial services. His market isn't 'people who want financial advice.' His market is 'male business owners, age 45-65, net worth between $1 million and $10 million, who are worried about protecting their assets from lawsuits and taxes, who read the Wall Street Journal and Forbes, play golf at country clubs, drive German luxury cars, and secretly fear they're one bad decision away from losing everything they've built.'

See the difference? When you know your market that specifically, everything else becomes easy.

Second M - MESSAGE. What are you saying to that market? And here's where 99% of businesses screw up. They talk about themselves. 'We've been in business 30 years.' 'We have the best quality.' 'We provide excellent service.' Nobody cares! Your message needs to be about THEM, not you. Their problems, their desires, their fears.

The message formula I've used to generate millions is simple: Problem, Agitate, Solution. Identify their problem, twist the knife a little to make them feel it, then present your solution. Not your product - your SOLUTION to their problem.

Third M - MEDIA. How are you delivering your message to your market? And this is where most people start, which is completely backwards. They say 'I need to be on Facebook' or 'I need to do SEO' without first knowing their market and message. The media is just the delivery vehicle. You choose it based on where your market is and what message you're delivering."

**Russell Brunson (08:16-09:00)**
"That's so powerful, Dan. And I see this mistake all the time. People come to me and say 'Russell, Facebook ads aren't working' or 'Email marketing is dead,' and I'm like, no, your market-message match is off. The media is rarely the problem."

**Dan Kennedy (09:01-12:30)**
"Exactly. And here's something else nobody talks about. You need multiple media. One is the road to the poorhouse. I call it the One-Legged Stool Problem. You're sitting on a one-legged stool, everything's fine, then suddenly that leg breaks and you're on your ass wondering what happened.

I had a client, very successful, doing $5 million a year, all from Google AdWords. Then Google changed their algorithm, and overnight he lost 80% of his business. One-legged stool.

You need at least three legs on your stool. Direct mail, email, and paid traffic. Or email, podcast, and affiliate marketing. Whatever combination works for your market, but never just one.

Now, let me tell you about the biggest mistake I see, and Russell, you've seen this too. Business owners who think they're different. 'But Dan, my business is different.' No, it's not. The principles of human psychology haven't changed in 5,000 years. People still buy for the same reasons they always have: fear, greed, desire for love, desire for significance.

I don't care if you're selling B2B enterprise software or dog treats. The Three M's apply. Direct response principles apply. Human psychology applies."

**Russell Brunson (12:31-13:15)**
"Speaking of direct response, Dan, can you explain what that means? Because I think a lot of people hear 'direct response marketing' and they don't really understand what makes it different from traditional marketing or brand marketing."

**Dan Kennedy (13:16-18:45)**
"Good question. Direct response marketing is marketing that demands a response. Right now. Not someday, not when they get around to it, but right now. Every piece of marketing you do should have a clear, specific call to action with a deadline.

Traditional marketing, brand marketing, that's all about 'awareness' and 'impressions' and other BS metrics you can't deposit in the bank. Coca-Cola can afford to do brand marketing. You can't. You need marketing that produces measurable, trackable, immediate results.

Let me give you the key elements of direct response:

One: Compelling headline that calls out your target market. 'Attention Dentists Who Want To Add $50,000 Per Month.'

Two: Irresistible offer. Not 'Call us for a quote' but 'Get our free report: 7 Ways Dentists Are Leaving $50,000 On The Table Every Month.'

Three: Reason to respond now. Deadline, limited quantity, bonus for fast action. No deadline, no response. That's a Kennedy Law.

Four: Multiple response mechanisms. Phone, website, mail-in form. Make it easy for them to respond however they prefer.

Five: Tracking. If you can't track it, you can't improve it. Every ad needs a code, every phone number needs to be tracked, every landing page needs analytics.

And here's the beauty of direct response - it's self-funding. You put a dollar in, you get two dollars out. You can scale as fast as you can handle the business. Try doing that with brand marketing.

I had a student, chiropractor, spending $5,000 a month on billboard advertising. Know how many patients it brought in? He had no idea. Couldn't track it. I had him cancel the billboard, use that $5,000 for a direct mail campaign with a free report offer and a new patient special. First month: 47 new patients, average value $2,000 each. That's $94,000 from a $5,000 investment. That's the power of direct response."

**Russell Brunson (18:46-19:30)**
"That's insane. 19X return on investment. And Dan, I want to highlight something you said - 'No deadline, no response.' Can you talk more about that? Because I see so many offers with no urgency, no scarcity, no reason to act now."

**Dan Kennedy (19:31-24:00)**
"This is critical. Human beings are procrastinators by nature. If there's no reason to act now, they won't. They'll think about it, they'll talk to their spouse, they'll shop around, they'll forget about it. Deadline creates urgency. Urgency creates action.

Now, the deadline has to be real and it has to be believable. 'Sale Ends Sunday' when you run the same sale every week? Nobody believes that. But 'First 19 callers get the bonus package because that's all we have in stock'? That's believable.

I use something called 'Legitimate Scarcity.' There's always a legitimate reason to limit your offer. Maybe you only have time to work with 10 clients. Maybe you only ordered 100 bonus packages. Maybe the special price is a test and you can't afford to do it for everyone.

Let me tell you a story. I was working with a jeweler. Valentine's Day promotion. He was going to run a '20% off everything' sale. I said no, that's boring, everyone does that. Instead, we created the 'Valentine's Panic Package.'

'Forgot Valentine's Day? We've created 19 emergency packages for panicked husbands. Each package includes jewelry, chocolates, flowers, and a card, all wrapped and ready to go. First come, first served. When they're gone, you're on your own.'

We sold all 19 packages in 3 hours at full price plus a $50 panic premium. That's the power of legitimate scarcity.

And here's another Kennedy Law: The money is in the list. Your customer list, your prospect list, these are your most valuable assets. Not your building, not your equipment, your lists.

Every business needs three lists: Prospects who haven't bought yet, customers who have bought, and past customers who haven't bought recently. Each list gets different marketing, different messages, different offers.

Your prospect list gets education and trust-building. Your customer list gets upsells and referral requests. Your past customer list gets reactivation campaigns.

Most businesses ignore their past customers. Huge mistake. It's 5-7 times more expensive to get a new customer than to reactivate an old one. I have clients who do a monthly 'We Miss You' campaign to past customers and it's their most profitable marketing every single month."

**Russell Brunson (24:01-24:45)**
"That's so true. We did a campaign to our past ClickFunnels members who had cancelled, simple email saying 'Come back and we'll give you three months at your old price plus these bonuses.' Brought back 2,000 members in a weekend. Dan, what about pricing? I know you have strong opinions about competing on price."

**Dan Kennedy (24:46-29:30)**
"Strong opinions? [laughs] That's one way to put it. Look, competing on price is a race to the bottom, and even if you win, you lose. There's always someone willing to go out of business faster than you.

Price is only an issue in the absence of value. When you create enough value, price becomes irrelevant. I charge $3,200 an hour for consulting. Know how many people complain about my price? Zero. Because the value is clear.

Here's how you charge premium prices: First, you position yourself as the expert, the authority, the only logical choice. Second, you create a proprietary system or methodology. Third, you pile on the value with bonuses and guarantees. Fourth, you make it about results, not time or materials.

Let me give you an example. Carpet cleaner. Traditionally charges $99 to clean three rooms. Commodity pricing. Racing to the bottom. I helped him reposition as 'The Healthy Home Expert.' Now he doesn't clean carpets, he 'creates a healthier environment for your family.'

His new package: Complete healthy home assessment, carpet cleaning with hospital-grade sanitizers, air quality test, allergen treatment, spot-free guarantee for 6 months, plus a monthly newsletter about maintaining a healthy home. Price: $497.

Same service? No. Same result? No. The result is peace of mind that your family is living in a healthy environment. That's worth $497. Clean carpets are worth $99.

You need what I call a 'Unique Selling Proposition.' What makes you different? And please, don't say quality or service. Everyone says that. You need something specific, measurable, meaningful to your market.

The famous example is Domino's: 'Fresh, hot pizza delivered in 30 minutes or less, or it's free.' Not the best pizza, not the cheapest pizza, but the only pizza that guaranteed delivery time. They built a billion-dollar business on that USP.

Your USP needs to answer the question: Why should I buy from you versus every other option including doing nothing? If you can't answer that in one sentence, you don't have a USP."

**Russell Brunson (29:31-30:15)**
"That's huge. And Dan, we're running out of time for this first episode, but I want to ask you about implementation. Because people are going to listen to this, get excited, then what? What should they do first?"

**Dan Kennedy (30:16-35:00)**
"First thing: Stop all marketing until you get clear on your Three M's. I'm serious. Every dollar you spend on marketing without clear Market, Message, Media is a dollar wasted.

Second: Create what I call a 'Shock and Awe Package.' This is what you send to new leads or new customers that positions you as the expert and builds massive value. Could be a book, a special report, a DVD, a box of stuff. But something physical that arrives and makes them say 'Wow, these people are serious.'

Third: Set up a follow-up system. Most sales happen after the 5th contact, but most businesses quit after the second. You need a systematic way to stay in touch with prospects until they buy or die. Email, direct mail, phone calls, whatever works for your market.

Fourth: Start testing. Small tests, track results, scale what works, kill what doesn't. Don't bet the farm on any one campaign. Test with 100 pieces of mail before you send 10,000. Test with $100 in ads before you spend $10,000.

Fifth: Join a mastermind or get a coach. You can't read the label from inside the jar. You need outside perspective, accountability, someone who's been where you want to go.

And here's the most important thing: Take action. Imperfect action beats perfect planning. You're going to screw up. Good. That means you're doing something. I've had more failures than you've had hot meals, but my failures taught me what works.

Remember: The market rewards action, not knowledge. I know plenty of broke people with MBAs. I know high school dropouts making millions. The difference? Action.

Listen, we've covered a lot today. The Three M's, direct response, USP, pricing strategy, lists, implementation. This is probably more real marketing education than most people get in a four-year degree. But knowledge without action is worthless.

So here's your homework: Define your target market. One specific person. Write out everything about them. Then write a one-page letter to that person about their biggest problem and how you solve it. That's your marketing message. Everything else builds from there."

**Russell Brunson (35:01-36:00)**
"That's perfect, Dan. And guys, this is just the beginning. We're going to go deep into each of these topics in future episodes. Next week, we're talking about the Psychology of Selling - why people really buy and how to push those buttons ethically.

Dan, any final words for our listeners?"

**Dan Kennedy (36:01-37:45)**
"Yeah. Stop looking for magic bullets. There aren't any. Marketing is a system, not an event. It's multiple moving parts working together. Get the foundation right - the Three M's - then layer on the tactics and strategies.

And remember what I call Kennedy's Law of Marketing: The business that can spend the most to acquire a customer wins. Not the one with the best product, not the one with the lowest price, the one that can spend the most to acquire a customer. Why? Because they have the highest lifetime value, the best back-end, the most effective marketing system.

Build that system, and you'll never worry about competition again. You'll have people lining up to buy from you at premium prices. You'll have the business and lifestyle you want. But it starts with implementation. Not someday, not when you're ready, but today.

One more thing - if you're serious about this, if you really want to transform your business, go to MagneticMarketing.com and get my free book. Just pay shipping. It's everything we talked about today plus a hundred other strategies. No excuses. Go get it now."

**Russell Brunson (37:46-38:30)**
"And that's it for episode one. Dan, thank you for sharing your wisdom. Guys, go get that book, implement what you learned today, and we'll see you next week when we dive into the Psychology of Selling.

Remember, you're either growing or dying. There is no standing still in business. Choose growth. Choose action. Choose to implement Magnetic Marketing in your business.

This is Russell Brunson and Dan Kennedy saying: Stop hoping and start marketing. See you next time."
