## Transcript

**Russell Brunson:** Welcome back to Dan Kennedy's Magnetic Marketing Podcast. Today we're diving into one of Dan's most powerful concepts - how to turn one-time buyers into clients, customers, and patients for life.

This isn't about customer service. This is about systematic customer retention and value maximization. Here's Dan Kennedy with strategies that can transform your business overnight.

**Dan Kennedy:** Let me start with a question that should terrify every business owner: How much did your last customer cost you to acquire?

Go ahead, do the math. Add up your advertising, your marketing, your sales costs, divide by the number of new customers. I'll wait.

Got that number? Good. Now let me ask you this: How much effort are you putting into keeping that customer compared to getting that customer?

If you're like 90% of businesses, you spend 10 times more energy acquiring customers than retaining them. That's not just stupid - it's financial suicide.

**The Retention Reality**

Here are some numbers that should wake you up:

- It costs 5 to 7 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one
- A 5% increase in customer retention can increase profits by 25% to 95%
- The probability of selling to an existing customer is 60-70%, while selling to a new prospect is only 5-20%

But here's what really matters: Your existing customers are your most valuable asset. They're your "customer equity." And most businesses treat them like garbage.

**The Three Levels of Customer Relationships**

There are three levels of customer relationships, and most businesses never get past level one:

**Level 1: Customers**
These are people who bought from you once. They completed a transaction. That's it. No relationship, no loyalty, no emotional connection.

Most businesses think this is success. "We made a sale!" No, you made a transaction. There's a massive difference.

**Level 2: Clients**
Clients have an ongoing relationship with you. They don't just buy your product - they buy into your expertise, your guidance, your solutions.

Clients come back repeatedly. They ask for advice. They trust your recommendations. They've moved from transactional to relational.

**Level 3: Patients**
This is the highest level. Patients don't just trust your expertise - they're completely dependent on you for ongoing care and guidance.

Like a medical patient, they wouldn't dream of going elsewhere. You're not just their vendor - you're their lifeline.

**The Customer Lifecycle System**

Moving customers through these levels requires a systematic approach. Here's the framework:

**Stage 1: The Acquisition**
Your relationship with a customer starts before they buy. It starts with your first impression, your marketing message, your sales process.

Are you positioning yourself as a vendor or as an expert? Are you competing on price or on value? Are you attracting customers or clients?

The type of customer you attract depends entirely on how you position yourself from day one.

**Stage 2: The Onboarding**
What happens immediately after someone becomes a customer is critical. This is where most businesses blow it completely.

They take the money and disappear. No follow-up, no welcome sequence, no guidance on getting the most from their purchase.

Within 48 hours of a purchase, you should have a comprehensive onboarding sequence that:
- Confirms their smart buying decision
- Helps them get immediate results
- Introduces them to additional resources
- Sets expectations for the relationship

**Stage 3: The Ascension**
This is where you systematically move customers up your value ladder. You don't wait for them to ask for more - you proactively offer additional solutions.

But here's the key: you only offer solutions that make sense for where they are in their journey. You meet them where they are and take them where they need to go.

**Stage 4: The Transformation**
At the highest level, you're not just selling products or services - you're facilitating transformation. You're helping them become a better version of themselves.

When customers see you as instrumental in their transformation, they become patients. They're dependent on your ongoing guidance.

**The Patient Mentality**

Let me explain what I mean by "patients" with a medical analogy.

When you go to a doctor, you don't shop around every time you need medical care. You don't negotiate the price of your prescription. You don't question whether you really need that follow-up appointment.

You trust the doctor's expertise completely. You follow their recommendations without question. You refer friends and family because you believe in the care you receive.

That's the relationship you want with your customers.

**Creating Patient Dependency**

How do you create this level of dependency? Through ongoing, escalating value delivery:

**1. Become Their Trusted Advisor**
Stop selling products. Start solving problems. Position yourself as the go-to expert in your field.

Your customers should think of you first whenever they have a problem you can solve. This requires consistent communication and value delivery.

**2. Create Information Dependency**
Become their primary source of information in your field. Regular newsletters, updates, insights, trends, warnings.

When they need to know what's happening in your industry, they should turn to you first, not Google.

**3. Develop Outcome Dependency**
Help them achieve results they couldn't achieve without you. Make yourself indispensable to their success.

When they try to do things without you, they should struggle. When they work with you, they should consistently win.

**4. Build Emotional Dependency**
This goes beyond business. You become part of their identity, their success story, their vision of themselves.

They don't just buy from you - they belong to your community, your movement, your philosophy.

**The Lifetime Value Calculation**

Here's how you determine if your retention efforts are working:

Calculate the lifetime value of your average customer. Not just the first purchase - the total value over the entire relationship.

For example:
- Average first purchase: $500
- Average purchases per year: 4
- Average customer lifespan: 3 years
- Lifetime value: $500 × 4 × 3 = $6,000

Now, if you can extend that customer lifespan from 3 years to 5 years through better retention, you've just increased their lifetime value by 67%.

**The Kennedy Retention System**

Here's my systematic approach to customer retention:

**1. The Welcome Campaign**
A sequence of communications immediately after purchase that:
- Reinforces their buying decision
- Helps them get quick wins
- Introduces your expertise
- Sets expectations for ongoing relationship

**2. The Education Series**
Regular, valuable content that positions you as the expert:
- Industry insights
- How-to guidance
- Case studies
- Trend analysis

**3. The Loyalty Program**
Rewards for continued business:
- Exclusive offers
- Early access to new products
- VIP treatment
- Special events

**4. The Surprise and Delight System**
Unexpected value that exceeds expectations:
- Bonus products
- Personal notes
- Birthday acknowledgments
- Achievement celebrations

**5. The Recovery Protocol**
A system for re-engaging customers who haven't purchased recently:
- Win-back campaigns
- Special offers
- Personal outreach
- Problem-solving assistance

**The Communication Matrix**

Your retention system requires multiple touchpoints:

**Immediate** (0-7 days):
- Purchase confirmation
- Delivery/access instructions
- Quick start guide
- Success tips

**Short-term** (1-4 weeks):
- Progress check-ins
- Additional resources
- Success stories
- Next-step recommendations

**Medium-term** (1-6 months):
- Regular newsletters
- Exclusive offers
- Educational content
- Community access

**Long-term** (6+ months):
- Loyalty rewards
- VIP programs
- Referral incentives
- Advanced solutions

**The Reactivation Strategy**

Even with the best retention system, some customers will go dormant. Here's how to bring them back:

**1. The Surprise Contact**
Reach out with no sales pitch. Just check in, see how they're doing, offer help.

**2. The We Miss You Campaign**
Acknowledge the absence, express that you miss them, offer a special "come back" incentive.

**3. The Problem-Solution Approach**
Identify new problems they might be facing and position yourself as the solution.

**4. The Exclusive Invitation**
Invite them to something special - a VIP event, early access to new products, exclusive content.

**The Referral Multiplier**

Happy long-term customers become your best salespeople. But you can't just hope for referrals - you need a system:

**1. Make Referrals Easy**
Provide tools, templates, and incentives that make it simple for customers to refer others.

**2. Reward Referrals Appropriately**
Both the referrer and the new customer should benefit. Make it a win-win-win.

**3. Track and Optimize**
Know which customers refer most often and why. Double down on what works.

**Common Retention Mistakes**

Here's what kills customer retention:

**1. Taking Customers for Granted**
Once someone becomes a customer, many businesses ignore them and focus only on new prospects.

**2. Generic Communications**
Treating all customers the same instead of segmenting based on value, behavior, and preferences.

**3. Selling Without Serving**
Every communication is a sales pitch instead of providing value first.

**4. Neglecting Problem Resolution**
When customers have issues, handling them poorly or slowly drives them away forever.

**5. No Progression Path**
Failing to offer natural next steps for customers who want to go deeper.

**The Measurement System**

Track these key metrics:

- Customer retention rate by time period
- Average customer lifespan
- Lifetime value by customer segment
- Repeat purchase rate
- Referral rate
- Reactivation success rate

**The Bottom Line**

Your customers are not transactions - they're relationships. And like any relationship, they require ongoing attention, care, and value delivery.

The businesses that win long-term are those that master customer retention. They build a base of loyal customers who buy repeatedly, refer frequently, and become advocates for the business.

It's not enough to get customers. You must keep them, grow them, and turn them into patients who depend on you for ongoing success.

Remember: a customer who buys once is a transaction. A customer who buys repeatedly is a relationship. A customer who can't imagine doing business without you is a patient.

Which level are you playing at?
