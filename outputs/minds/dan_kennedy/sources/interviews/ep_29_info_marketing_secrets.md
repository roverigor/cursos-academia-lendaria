## Transcript

**Russell Brunson:** Welcome back to Dan Kennedy's Magnetic Marketing Podcast. Today we're diving deep into what Dan calls "Info Marketing 2.0" - the evolution of the information marketing business model that's creating more millionaires than any other business model in history.

This isn't just about selling courses or ebooks. This is about building a systematic business that converts your knowledge, experience, and expertise into consistent, scalable income. Here's Dan Kennedy.

**Dan Kennedy:** Let me start with a bold statement that might offend some people: Every business owner should be in the information marketing business.

I don't care if you're a plumber, a dentist, a restaurant owner, or a Fortune 500 CEO. You should be packaging and selling your knowledge alongside your core products and services.

Why? Because information marketing is the ultimate leverage business. You create it once, sell it repeatedly. The marginal cost approaches zero, but the value - and price - can be enormous.

**What Is Information Marketing 2.0?**

Information Marketing 1.0 was about selling courses, ebooks, and newsletters. That still works, but it's just the beginning.

Information Marketing 2.0 is about becoming the trusted authority in your field and monetizing that authority through multiple streams:

- Premium information products
- High-value coaching and consulting
- Mastermind groups and communities
- Speaking and training engagements
- Licensing and franchising opportunities
- Software and tools
- Live events and workshops

It's about building an empire around your expertise.

**The Knowledge Economy Reality**

We're living in the greatest time in history to monetize knowledge. Here's why:

**1. Information Has Never Been More Valuable**
In a rapidly changing world, people desperately need guidance, shortcuts, and frameworks to navigate complexity.

**2. Traditional Education Is Failing**
Schools teach theory. People need practical, immediately applicable knowledge.

**3. Access Has Never Been Easier**
The internet has eliminated most barriers to reaching your audience globally.

**4. Competition Is Actually Low**
Despite what it looks like, most people in the information business are doing it wrong. There's enormous opportunity for those who do it right.

**The Authority-Based Business Model**

The foundation of Information Marketing 2.0 is authority. Not just expertise - authority. There's a massive difference.

**Expertise** is what you know. **Authority** is what others believe you know, combined with their trust in your ability to help them get results.

You can be the world's leading expert on something, but if nobody knows it or trusts you, you have no authority.

Conversely, you can have modest expertise but massive authority if you know how to position and market yourself correctly.

**The Three Pillars of Info Marketing Authority**

**Pillar 1: Positioning**
How you position yourself determines everything. Are you a:
- Generic consultant, or the leading authority?
- Service provider, or the expert who teaches service providers?
- Student of the game, or the person who created the game?

Position yourself at the top of the food chain, not the bottom.

**Pillar 2: Platform**
Your platform is how you reach and influence your market. This includes:
- Your website and content
- Social media presence
- Speaking opportunities
- Media appearances
- Industry relationships
- Published works

Your platform creates and amplifies your authority.

**Pillar 3: Proof**
Authority requires proof. This comes from:
- Your results and achievements
- Your clients' results and testimonials
- Your predictions that came true
- Your frameworks that work
- Your innovations that others adopt

Proof converts skeptics into believers.

**The Info Marketing Value Ladder**

Successful information marketers create a value ladder that moves customers from low-cost entry points to high-value premium offerings:

**Level 1: Free Content (Lead Generation)**
- Blog posts and articles
- Free reports and checklists

**The Content-to-Cash System**

Here's how to systematically convert your knowledge into cash:

**Step 1: Core Content Creation**
Identify your unique framework, system, or methodology. This becomes your "signature system" that differentiates you from everyone else.

Your core content should:
- Solve a specific, painful problem
- Deliver a desired outcome
- Be teachable and repeatable
- Have proven results

**Step 2: Content Multiplication**
Take your core content and multiply it across formats:
- Written content (articles, books, reports)
- Audio content (podcasts, interviews, courses)
- Video content (training, webinars, tutorials)
- Interactive content (workshops, coaching, consulting)

**Step 3: Audience Development**
Build your audience systematically:
- Create valuable free content consistently
- Optimize for search and social discovery
- Partner with other authorities in your space
- Speak at industry events
- Get featured in relevant media

**Step 4: List Building**
Convert audience into subscribers:
- Offer irresistible lead magnets
- Use multiple opt-in opportunities
- Implement follow-up sequences
- Segment based on interests and behavior

**Step 5: Monetization**
Convert subscribers into customers:
- Start with low-cost offerings
- Prove value immediately
- Move customers up the value ladder
- Focus on lifetime value, not just initial sales

**The Expert Positioning Strategy**

To command premium prices, you must position yourself as THE expert, not just another expert. Here's how:

**1. Create Your Own Category**
Don't compete in existing categories. Create new ones where you're automatically the leader.

Instead of "marketing consultant," become "the customer acquisition specialist for professional service firms."

**2. Develop Proprietary Methodologies**
Create and name your own systems, frameworks, and processes. This makes you un-commoditizable.

**3. Predict the Future**
Make predictions about your industry. When you're right, it builds massive authority.

**4. Challenge Conventional Wisdom**
Take controversial positions that differentiate you from the crowd. Controversy creates attention.

**5. Create Your Own Language**
Develop terminology specific to your approach. When people use your language, you own the conversation.

**The Recurring Revenue Model**

One-time sales are good. Recurring revenue is better. Build recurring income streams:

**Membership Sites**
Monthly or annual subscriptions for ongoing content, community access, and exclusive resources.

**Continuity Programs**
Ongoing coaching, support, or service delivery with monthly billing.

**Software and Tools**
Recurring subscriptions for software solutions that support your teachings.

**Masterminds**
High-value group programs with annual or quarterly billing.

**Licensing**
Others pay to use your content, systems, or brand in their businesses.

**The Authority Publishing Strategy**

Publishing builds authority like nothing else. But do it strategically:

**Books**
- Position you as the expert
- Generate leads and speaking opportunities
- Command higher fees
- Create passive income

**Articles and Guest Posts**
- Build relationships with industry publications
- Reach new audiences
- Demonstrate expertise
- Create content for repurposing

**Research and Studies**
- Generate original data
- Get media attention
- Support your methodologies
- Position you as a thought leader

**The Speaking Circuit**

Speaking accelerates everything in information marketing:

**Benefits of Speaking:**
- Instant authority building
- Direct sales opportunities
- Relationship building
- Content creation
- Media exposure

**Speaking Strategy:**
- Start with smaller events to build skills
- Create a signature presentation
- Always collect contact information
- Have clear calls to action
- Follow up systematically

**The Joint Venture Multiplier**

Partner with other authorities to accelerate growth:

**Cross-Promotion**
Promote each other's products to your respective audiences.

**Co-Created Products**
Combine expertise to create unique offerings.

**Affiliate Partnerships**
Earn commissions promoting complementary products.

**Speaking Exchanges**
Speak to each other's audiences or at each other's events.

**Bundle Opportunities**
Include your products in others' bundles and vice versa.

**The Technology Stack**

You don't need complex technology, but you need the right tools:

**Essential Tools:**
- Website with blog capability
- Email marketing system
- Shopping cart and payment processing
- Video hosting and delivery
- Customer management system

**Advanced Tools:**
- Membership site platform
- Webinar software
- Course delivery system
- Community platform
- Analytics and tracking

**The Scaling Strategy**

To scale beyond your personal time:

**1. Systematize Everything**
Create processes, templates, and systems that others can execute.

**2. Build a Team**
Hire specialists for content creation, marketing, customer service, and fulfillment.

**3. License Your Content**
Allow others to deliver your content under license.

**4. Create Certification Programs**
Train others to become certified in your methodology.

**5. Develop Franchise Models**
Create turnkey business opportunities based on your expertise.

**Common Info Marketing Mistakes**

**1. Teaching Everything You Know**
Focus on specific outcomes, not comprehensive education.

**2. Competing on Price**
Position on value and results, not price.

**3. One-Size-Fits-All Approaches**
Segment your market and create targeted solutions.

**4. Inconsistent Content Creation**
Regular, consistent content beats sporadic brilliance.

**5. Focusing Only on Products**
Build relationships and community, not just products.

**The Info Marketing Mindset**

Success in information marketing requires a specific mindset:

**1. You Are the Product**
People buy you first, your information second.

**2. Results Matter More Than Content**
Focus on customer outcomes, not just information delivery.

**3. Authority Is Built Daily**
Consistent value delivery builds authority over time.

**4. Premium Pricing Is Possible**
If you solve expensive problems, you can charge premium prices.

**5. Systems Beat Heroics**
Build systems that work without your constant involvement.

**Getting Started Today**

If you're not already in the information business, here's how to start:

**Week 1:**
- Identify your unique expertise and target market
- Create your first lead magnet
- Set up basic website and email capture

**Week 2:**
- Write your first valuable content piece
- Create your signature framework
- Plan your content calendar

**Week 3:**

**Week 4:**

**The Bottom Line**

Information marketing isn't just a business model - it's the business model for the knowledge economy.

If you have expertise, experience, or knowledge that can help others get results, you have a moral obligation to package and share it.

The world needs what you know. The question is: Will you systematically build a business around it, or will you let that value remain trapped in your head?

The greatest wealth transfer in history is happening right now, from those who need knowledge to those who can provide it effectively.

Position yourself on the right side of that transfer.
