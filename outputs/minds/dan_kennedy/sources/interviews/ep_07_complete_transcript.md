## Clients, Customers, and Patients For Life
### Full Episode Transcript (52 minutes)

**Russell Brunson (00:00-00:45)**
"Welcome back to the Magnetic Marketing Podcast, episode 7, and today we're talking about something that could literally double or triple your business without getting a single new customer. Dan Kennedy is here to teach us about creating clients, customers, and patients for life. Dan, this is one of your favorite topics, isn't it?"

**Dan Kennedy (00:46-02:30)**
"It is, Russell, because it's where the real money is and almost nobody gets it. Everyone's obsessed with new customer acquisition - Facebook ads, SEO, all that nonsense - while ignoring the gold mine sitting in their existing customer list.

Let me give you a number that'll make you sick: The average business loses 20% of its customers every year. That means in 5 years, you've turned over your entire customer base. You're filling a leaky bucket. It's insane.

But here's the kicker - it costs 5 to 7 times more to get a new customer than to keep an existing one. And an existing customer is 60-70% likely to buy from you again, while a new prospect is 5-20% likely to buy. So why the hell is everyone focused on new customers?

I'll tell you why: It's sexy. It's exciting. Retention is boring. But boring is profitable. I'd rather be rich and bored than poor and excited."

**Russell Brunson (02:31-03:00)**
"[Laughs] Rich and bored. I love it. So Dan, let's break this down. How do you create customers for life? What's the system?"

**Dan Kennedy (03:01-06:45)**
"First, you need to understand the Customer Lifecycle Value equation. Most businesses think transactionally - one sale, done. Smart businesses think relationally - lifetime value.

Here's a real example: Dentist in Ohio. Average new patient worth $275 on first visit. He was spending $150 to get each patient, making $125. Barely profitable. But we tracked lifetime value. Average patient stays 7 years, comes twice a year, spends $275 per visit, refers 2.3 other patients. Total lifetime value: $8,338.

Now he can spend $1,000 to get a patient and still be wildly profitable. That's the power of thinking lifetime value.

But here's the thing - lifetime value isn't automatic. You have to engineer it. You have to create systems that keep customers coming back, buying more, referring others. That's what we're talking about today.

The foundation is what I call the Three Levels of Relationship:

Level 1: Transactional. They buy, you deliver, done. Most businesses are stuck here. It's a vendor relationship. Easily replaced.

Level 2: Preferred Provider. They like you, trust you, prefer you over competitors. But they'll still shop around if you're not careful.

Level 3: Trusted Advisor. They don't make decisions without you. Price is irrelevant. Competition doesn't exist. This is where you want to be.

How do you get to Level 3? Three things: Frequency, Intimacy, and Theater."

**Russell Brunton (06:46-07:15)**
"Frequency, Intimacy, and Theater. That sounds like a relationship advice book, Dan."

**Dan Kennedy (07:16-12:00)**
"It is relationship advice! Business is relationships. People buy from people they know, like, and trust. That's not a cliché, it's brain science. The limbic system, which controls buying decisions, responds to emotional connection, not logical arguments.

So Frequency - how often are you in touch with customers? Most businesses contact customers when they want money. That's like the friend who only calls when he needs to borrow something. Nobody likes that guy.

You need to be in touch at least monthly, preferably weekly, with valuable content, not just sales pitches. Newsletter, email, podcast, something. The more frequent the contact, the stronger the relationship.

I have a client, financial advisor. Used to mail clients quarterly statements. Retention rate: 72%. Started sending weekly email with market commentary, monthly printed newsletter with personal stories, birthday cards, thanksgiving cards. Retention rate now: 94%. Same service, better communication.

Intimacy - how well do you know your customers? Not just their buying history, but their lives, their problems, their goals. And how much do they know about you?

People don't buy from companies, they buy from people. Show them who you are. Tell stories. Share struggles. Be human. My newsletter has as much about my ranch and horses as it does about marketing. People feel like they know me. That's intimacy.

Theater - this is the experience you create. Disney doesn't have employees, they have cast members. They're not providing customer service, they're putting on a show. What's your show?

I know a dentist who transformed his practice with theater. Instead of a waiting room, he has a 'comfort lounge' with massage chairs, fresh cookies, and a coffee bar. Instead of dental work, he provides 'smile transformation experiences.' Same drilling and filling, different story. His prices are 300% higher than average, and he has a waiting list.

Every touchpoint is an opportunity for theater. How you answer the phone, how you package your product, how you handle complaints. It's all theater, and theater creates emotion, and emotion creates loyalty."

**Russell Brunson (12:01-12:45)**
"This is so good. And Dan, I want to dig into something specific - the newsletter. You're famous for your 'No B.S. Marketing Newsletter.' You've been doing it for what, 30 years? Why is a printed newsletter so powerful in the digital age?"

**Dan Kennedy (12:46-18:30)**
"33 years, actually. Over 400 issues. Never missed a month. And yes, printed, mailed, old-school newsletter. In the age of email and social media. Why? Because it works.

Here's what people don't understand about print: It has staying power. An email gets deleted in 3 seconds. A social media post disappears in the feed. But a printed newsletter sits on someone's desk, coffee table, bathroom - yes, bathroom. It gets passed around, saved, referred back to.

I have subscribers who have every issue. They treat them like collector's items. Try doing that with email.

But the real power of a newsletter isn't the medium, it's the model. A newsletter creates a subscription relationship. They're paying you every month to be in relationship with you. That's powerful psychology. When someone pays for something, they value it more. Free advice is worth what you pay for it.

My newsletter is $97 a month. I have over 20,000 subscribers. Do the math. That's $2 million a month in recurring revenue before I sell anything else. And these subscribers buy everything else I offer at 10 times the rate of non-subscribers.

Here's how to create a newsletter that builds customers for life:

First, make it personality-driven. It's YOUR newsletter, not your company's. People subscribe to people, not companies. Share opinions, stories, rants. Be polarizing. The worst thing you can be is boring.

Second, mix content. 60% educational, 20% entertainment, 20% promotional. Yes, sell in every issue, but sell after you've delivered value.

Third, create appointment reading. Same time every month. Same format. Consistent sections. My readers know exactly what to expect: opening rant, main article, guest expert, member spotlight, resources, classified ads. Familiarity breeds loyalty.

Fourth, make it exclusive. Not everything should be free on your blog. Save your best stuff for paying subscribers. Create FOMO - fear of missing out.

Fifth, use it as a trojan horse. The newsletter gets you in the door every month. Once you're in, you can sell coaching, events, products, services. The newsletter is the relationship, everything else is monetization."

**Russell Brunson (18:31-19:15)**
"That's brilliant. The newsletter as a trojan horse. Dan, let's talk about something else that creates lifetime customers - your approach to customer service. Or as you call it, 'customer astonishment.'"

**Dan Kennedy (19:16-24:45)**
"Right. Customer service is playing not to lose. Customer astonishment is playing to win. Service meets expectations. Astonishment exceeds them so dramatically that customers can't shut up about you.

True story: Guy orders pizza from Domino's. Puts in special instructions: 'Draw a unicorn on the box.' Driver shows up, box has a hand-drawn unicorn. Guy posts photo online. Goes viral. Millions in free publicity from a 30-second doodle.

That's customer astonishment. It doesn't have to be expensive. It has to be unexpected.

Here's my system - the Five Moments of Astonishment:

Moment 1: First contact. What happens when someone first calls, emails, or walks in? Most businesses blow this. Automated phone tree, generic email, minimum-wage employee who doesn't care.

I have a client, high-end jeweler. When you call, a real person answers within 2 rings, knows your name from caller ID, says 'Welcome back, Mrs. Smith. How can I make your day sparkle?' That's astonishment at first contact.

Moment 2: First purchase. This is your chance to cement the relationship. Most businesses send a receipt. Maybe a thank you email if you're lucky.

My student, online supplement company. First order arrives in a premium box with a handwritten thank you note, free sample pack, and a golden ticket for 50% off next order if used within 7 days. First-time buyer to second purchase rate: 73%. Industry average: 27%.

Moment 3: Problem resolution. Problems are opportunities in disguise. Handle them right, and you create a customer for life. Handle them wrong, and they'll tell 50 people on social media.

The formula: Acknowledge fast, apologize sincerely, fix completely, compensate generously. Most businesses fail at compensate generously. They fix the problem but don't make up for the inconvenience.

Zappos is famous for this. Shipping mistake? They overnight the correct order and let you keep the wrong one. That's why their customer lifetime value is $3,000+ for shoes.

Moment 4: Milestone recognition. Birthdays, anniversaries, achievements. Most businesses ignore these. Smart businesses celebrate them.

Restaurant chain I work with tracks first visit anniversary. Every year on that date, customers get a letter: 'It's been exactly 3 years since your first visit. Here's a gift certificate for a free appetizer and dessert to celebrate.' Cost: $8. Lifetime value increase: $340.

Moment 5: Exit attempt. When someone tries to cancel or leave, most businesses just process it. Smart businesses use it as a retention opportunity.

Software company I advised. When someone hits cancel, instead of processing immediately, they get a pop-up: 'Wait! Would you stay if we gave you 3 months at 50% off?' 40% take the offer. Those who still cancel get a personal call from the founder within 24 hours. 20% reactivate from that call.

Five moments, five opportunities to create lifetime customers."

**Russell Brunson (24:46-25:30)**
"This is gold. And Dan, I know you have strong feelings about loyalty programs. Most businesses think loyalty programs create lifetime customers, but you say they're mostly garbage. Why?"

**Dan Kennedy (25:31-31:00)**
"Because most loyalty programs aren't about loyalty, they're about discounting. 'Buy 10, get one free.' That's not loyalty, that's bribery. You're training customers to be price shoppers.

Real loyalty isn't about points or punches on a card. It's about belonging. Humans are tribal. We want to belong to something bigger than ourselves. Smart businesses create tribes, not loyalty programs.

Harley-Davidson doesn't have a loyalty program. They have a culture. HOG - Harley Owners Group. Million members worldwide. They don't buy motorcycles, they buy membership in a tribe. That's why a Harley costs 50% more than comparable bikes and nobody cares.

If you must have a loyalty program, here's how to do it right:

First, make it about status, not discounts. Airlines figured this out. Gold, Platinum, Diamond levels. Each level gets privileges, not just discounts. Early boarding, lounge access, dedicated phone line. Status is more powerful than savings.

Second, surprise and delight randomly. Predictable rewards become entitlements. Random rewards create excitement. Casino psychology.

Starbucks does this brilliantly. Random free drinks, bonus star days, surprise offers. You never know what's coming, so you keep engaging.

Third, make it exclusive. Not everyone should be in your loyalty program. There should be qualifications, applications, maybe even rejection. Exclusivity creates desire.

American Express Black Card. $5,000 annual fee. By invitation only. Minimum $250,000 annual spending. People kill to get one. That's a loyalty program.

Fourth, create community among members. Members-only events, Facebook groups, special communications. Let them connect with each other, not just with you.

Wine club I work with. Monthly shipments are nice, but the magic is the quarterly winemaker dinners. Members only. They've become friends. Now they're not just loyal to the wine, they're loyal to the community. Retention rate: 89%. Industry average: 60%.

Fifth, layer in gamification. Points, levels, challenges, leaderboards. Make it fun to be loyal. People will do irrational things for meaningless points and badges. Look at Peloton. People pay $40/month to ride a stationary bike for virtual high-fives.

But remember - no loyalty program can overcome a crappy product or service. Fix the fundamentals first, then layer on the loyalty system."

**Russell Brunson (31:01-31:45)**
"That's so true about the fundamentals. Dan, let's talk about something you mentioned earlier - referrals. You said your dentist client's average patient refers 2.3 other patients. That doesn't happen by accident, does it?"

**Dan Kennedy (31:46-37:30)**
"No, referrals don't happen by accident. Hope is not a marketing strategy. If you want referrals, you have to engineer them. Most businesses sit back and wait for referrals to happen. Smart businesses create systems that generate referrals predictably.

Here's the dirty secret about referrals: Even happy customers don't refer unless you make it easy and give them a reason. They're busy. They forget. They don't know what to say. You have to orchestrate the entire process.

My Referral Multiplication System has five components:

Component 1: Ask at the point of maximum happiness. Not randomly, but when they're most delighted. Just after you've delivered great results. Just after you've solved a problem. Just after they've complimented you. That's when you ask.

The ask formula: 'I'm so glad you're happy with [specific result]. You probably know other [target market] who [have same problem]. Who comes to mind?' Specific is terrific. Vague is plague.

Component 2: Give them the tools. Don't make them figure out what to say. Give them emails to forward, cards to hand out, social media posts to share. Make it copy-paste simple.

Financial advisor client. Created 'Introduction Cards.' High-quality cards clients can give to friends. 'I've been working with [advisor] for [time] and thought you might benefit from a conversation. This card entitles you to a complimentary portfolio review valued at $500.'

Card has advisor's photo, credentials, contact info. Client just hands it over. No awkward sales pitch. Professional, easy, effective. Each card generates 3.4 introductions.

Component 3: Incentivize both parties. Don't just reward the referrer, reward the referred. Makes it win-win, not selfish.

Carpet cleaner client. Referrer gets $50 credit. Referred friend gets $50 off first cleaning. Both win. Referral rate went from 5% to 31%.

But be careful with incentives. Too small, insulting. Too large, feels like a bribe. Test different offers. Sometimes non-monetary incentives work better. Exclusive access, special status, charity donations.

Component 4: Create referral events. Instead of one-off requests, create systematic referral campaigns.

Dentist does 'Bring a Friend to the Dentist Day' twice a year. Current patients bring someone who hasn't been to dentist in 2+ years. Free cleaning and exam for the friend. $50 credit for the patient. Spa treatment room reserved just for these appointments. Makes it special, not scary. Generates 40+ new patients each event.

Component 5: Celebrate and showcase referrals. When someone refers, make a big deal about it. Public recognition, thank you notes, social media shout-outs.

Insurance agent client. Has a 'Referral Hall of Fame' wall in his office. Photos of top referrers. Monthly 'Referral Champion' parking spot. Quarterly referral appreciation dinner. His clients compete to refer more. It's gamification meets social proof.

The key is systematic execution. Schedule referral requests into your calendar. Track who you've asked, when, what happened. Follow up with those who said they would refer. Thank those who did. Ask again those who didn't.

Most businesses ask for referrals once and give up. Persistent businesses create referral machines."

**Russell Brunson (37:31-38:15)**
"That's incredible. The referral hall of fame, I love that. Dan, we're getting close to time, but I want to ask about reactivation. You mentioned earlier that businesses lose 20% of customers per year. How do you get them back?"

**Dan Kennedy (38:16-44:00)**
"Lost customer reactivation is the lowest-hanging fruit in marketing. These people already know you, already bought from you, already have their credit card on file in many cases. They just drifted away. Usually not because they're unhappy, but because they forgot about you or their situation changed.

The problem is most businesses are too proud to go after lost customers. They take it personally. 'If they don't want us, screw them.' That's ego, not business. Get over yourself and get the customer back.

Here's my Lost Customer CPR System - Customer Profitable Reactivation:

Step 1: Segment your lost customers. Not all lost customers are equal. Some are worth fighting for, others aren't. Segment by recency, frequency, monetary value.

Recent losses (90 days or less): Easiest to win back. Usually a service hiccup or temporary situation.
Medium-term losses (91-365 days): Need reminding why they bought originally.
Long-term losses (365+ days): Need complete reintroduction.

High-value losses: Worth personal outreach.
Medium-value: Worth systematic campaigns.
Low-value: Worth email only.

Step 2: Diagnose why they left. Don't guess, ask. Send a survey, make a phone call, analyze their history. Different reasons require different approaches.

Price shoppers need value reminders.
Service problems need apologies and assurance.
Changed needs require new solutions.
Forgot about you need attention and engagement.

Step 3: Create an irresistible comeback offer. Not just 'come back,' but 'come back and get this amazing deal you can't get anywhere else.'

Gym client. Lost member reactivation: 'We've upgraded everything since you left. Come back and pay what you used to pay (grandfathered rate), plus get 3 months of personal training free, plus bring a friend free for 90 days.' 34% reactivation rate.

The key is to make the offer so good they feel stupid saying no. Yes, you might lose money on the first transaction. But lifetime value, remember?

Step 4: Use multiple touches and media. One email won't do it. You need a sequence. Email, direct mail, phone, text. Different messages, same goal.

The sequence that works:
Touch 1: We miss you letter. Personal, emotional, no pitch.
Touch 2: What's new since you left. Updates, improvements, new offerings.
Touch 3: Special invitation back. The irresistible offer.
Touch 4: Deadline approaching. Urgency and scarcity.
Touch 5: Last chance. Final notice.
Touch 6: We'll keep your offer open 48 more hours. Deadline extension for procrastinators.

Step 5: Make it easy to come back. Remove all friction. No hoops to jump through, no punishment for leaving, no lectures. Welcome them back like the prodigal son.

Software company client. Reactivation used to require calling support, explaining why you left, getting re-approved. Now it's one click: 'Reactivate My Account.' That change alone doubled reactivation rate.

Here's a ninja trick: The 'We're Breaking Up' campaign. Send lost customers a breakup letter. 'It's not you, it's us. We obviously failed to keep you happy. Before we part ways forever, would you tell us what we did wrong? As a thank you, here's a $50 credit if you ever want to give us another chance.'

53% response rate. 28% used the credit. And you get invaluable feedback about why customers leave.

The math on reactivation is compelling. If you have 1,000 customers and lose 20% per year, that's 200 lost customers. If you can win back just 25% of them, that's 50 customers. At zero acquisition cost. If average customer value is $1,000, that's $50,000 in found money."

**Russell Brunson (44:01-44:45)**
"Found money. I love that. Dan, this has been incredible. We've covered the lifetime value equation, three levels of relationship, frequency, intimacy, theater, newsletters, customer astonishment, loyalty programs, referrals, and reactivation. That's like a complete MBA in customer retention. What's the one thing people should do first?"

**Dan Kennedy (44:46-48:30)**
"Calculate your real customer lifetime value. Not what you hope it is, not what it should be, but what it actually is right now. Track a cohort of customers for at least 12 months. How much do they spend? How often do they buy? How long do they stay? How many people do they refer?

Once you know that number, you'll make different decisions about everything. How much to spend on acquisition, how much to invest in retention, whether to fire problem customers.

Then implement one thing from what we talked about today. Just one. Don't try to do everything at once. Maybe it's a monthly newsletter. Maybe it's a referral system. Maybe it's a reactivation campaign. Pick one, implement it completely, measure results, then add the next thing.

Here's the mindset shift: Stop thinking about making sales and start thinking about acquiring customers. A sale is an event. A customer is an asset. Assets appreciate if you maintain them properly.

Every customer you keep is one less you have to find. Every customer who buys again is pure profit because acquisition cost is zero. Every customer who refers others is free marketing.

The most successful businesses in the world aren't the best at getting customers. They're the best at keeping customers. Amazon Prime - 94% renewal rate. Netflix - created binge-watching to increase retention. Apple - ecosystem lock-in.

You don't need to be Amazon to use these principles. The local pizza shop that remembers your usual order. The accountant who calls quarterly just to check in. The consultant who sends birthday cards. These little things create lifetime customers.

Last thing - and this is important - customer retention is not a department, it's a philosophy. Everyone in your organization touches customer retention. The receptionist who answers the phone. The delivery driver who drops off packages. The accountant who sends invoices. Everyone is either building relationships or destroying them.

Make retention everyone's job. Measure it, reward it, celebrate it. Because ultimately, the business that keeps customers longest wins. Not the one with the best product, not the one with the biggest advertising budget, the one with the best relationship with its customers.

Remember: Your net worth is determined by your network. And your network starts with your customer list. Treat it like the gold it is."

**Russell Brunson (48:31-49:30)**
"That's powerful, Dan. Your net worth is determined by your network. Guys, this episode is pure gold. If you're not taking notes, you need to listen again. And again. And probably again after that.

Next week, we're talking about something Dan calls 'The Phenomenon' - how to create such massive buzz and anticipation for your product that people are literally waiting in line to buy. Think iPhone launch, but for your business.

Dan, thanks for sharing these lifetime customer strategies. Any final words?"

**Dan Kennedy (49:31-51:45)**
"Yeah, stop being transactional and start being relational. Every interaction with a customer is either a deposit or withdrawal from the relationship bank account. Make more deposits than withdrawals, and you'll have customers for life.

And here's something nobody talks about - customers for life become your unpaid sales force. They're more believable than any advertisement, more persuasive than any salesperson, more effective than any marketing campaign. A business with lifetime customers doesn't need to advertise. The customers do it for them.

One more story. Client of mine, boutique hotel, 47 rooms. Tracks everything. Average guest stays 2.3 nights, comes back 1.7 times per year, refers 0.8 other guests. He implements everything we talked about today. Personal welcome notes, surprise upgrades, anniversary recognition, VIP program, referral rewards, reactivation campaigns.

Two years later: Average stay 3.1 nights, comes back 4.2 times per year, refers 3.4 other guests. Same hotel, same rooms, same location. Revenue up 340%. Profit up 500% because marketing costs dropped 70%.

That's the power of creating customers for life. It's not about working harder, it's about working smarter. It's not about finding more customers, it's about keeping the ones you have and helping them buy more, more often, and bring their friends.

Do this right, and you'll never worry about competition again. Because while they're fighting over new customers, you'll be banking profits from lifetime customers. Let them fight over scraps while you feast on the banquet.

Get to work on this. Not tomorrow, not next week, today. Your future wealth depends on the relationships you build with customers today. Don't wait. Start now."

**Russell Brunson (51:46-52:00)**
"Start now. Perfect way to end. Thanks Dan. Everyone, go implement one thing from this episode today. Not tomorrow, today. We'll see you next week for 'The Phenomenon.' This is Russell Brunson saying stop chasing customers and start keeping them. Peace out."
