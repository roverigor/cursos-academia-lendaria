## The BIG Marketing Sin
### Full Episode Transcript (48 minutes)

**Russell Brunson (00:00-00:35)**
"Welcome to Episode 39 of the Magnetic Marketing Podcast. Today Dan Kennedy is going to reveal what he calls 'The BIG Marketing Sin' - the one mistake that kills more businesses than any other. Dan, you've been ranting about this for 40 years. Tell us what gets you so fired up."

**Dan Kennedy (00:36-03:15)**
"Russell, if I had to pick one thing that separates successful businesses from failures, it's this: measurement. Or more specifically, the lack of it. The BIG marketing sin is marketing without measuring.

I'm going to be blunt here, and some people won't like it, but I don't care. If you're not measuring everything in your marketing, you're not a marketer, you're a gambler. And not even a good gambler, because at least they know the odds.

I can't tell you how many times I've asked a business owner, 'What's your cost per lead?' Blank stare. 'What's your conversion rate?' Shoulder shrug. 'What's your customer acquisition cost?' 'I don't know, but we're doing great on Facebook!'

No, you're not doing great. You're guessing. You're hoping. You're praying. You're doing everything except running a business.

Here's a Kennedy Truth Bomb: What gets measured gets improved. What doesn't get measured gets ignored, wasted, or worse - it becomes a cancer that slowly kills your business while you're celebrating vanity metrics like followers and impressions."

**Russell Brunson (03:16-03:45)**
"Preach! I see this all the time. People bragging about their viral video with a million views, but they can't pay their rent. So Dan, break this down for us. What exactly should we be measuring?"

**Dan Kennedy (03:46-09:30)**
"Everything. Every damn thing. But let me give you the hierarchy, the numbers that matter most, in order of importance.

Number 1: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). This is the big kahuna. If you don't know what a customer is worth over their lifetime, you don't know what you can spend to get one. You're flying blind.

Real example: Pizza shop owner tells me he can't afford to spend more than $5 to get a customer because his average order is $20 and his margin is 25%. I said, 'You're an idiot.' Turns out his average customer orders 2.3 times per month for 14 months. That's $644 in revenue, $161 in profit. He can spend $100 to get a customer and still be profitable. But he's stuck at $5 because he's thinking transactionally, not relationally.

Number 2: Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC). What does it really cost you to get a customer? Not a lead, not a click, a customer. Someone who gives you money.

And I mean the real cost. Ad spend plus creative plus management plus platform fees plus sales team plus everything else. Most people only count ad spend. That's like counting only the flour when calculating the cost of bread.

Number 3: Conversion Rate at Every Step. Not just the final conversion, every micro-conversion in your funnel.
- Ad to landing page click-through rate
- Landing page to lead conversion
- Lead to appointment booking
- Appointment to show-up rate
- Show-up to sales presentation
- Presentation to close

If you don't know these numbers, you don't know where your funnel is broken. It's like driving a car with no dashboard. You don't know if you're out of gas, overheating, or about to throw a rod.

Number 4: Return on Ad Spend (ROAS). But not the BS ROAS that agencies report. Real ROAS including all costs and measured over time, not just first purchase.

Number 5: Revenue Per Visitor (RPV). This tells you what each visitor to your website or store is worth. If your RPV is $2 and it costs you $3 to get a visitor, you're going broke. Simple math that most businesses ignore.

Number 6: Average Order Value (AOV). How much does each customer spend per transaction? This is a lever you can pull immediately. Increase AOV by 20% and you've increased profits by 20% with the same number of customers.

Number 7: Purchase Frequency. How often do customers buy? Another lever. Get customers to buy one more time per year and watch what happens to your bottom line.

Number 8: Lead Response Time. How fast do you respond to inquiries? MIT study: Responding within 5 minutes makes you 100x more likely to make contact and 21x more likely to qualify the lead. Yet average response time is 42 hours. Insane.

Number 9: Churn Rate. What percentage of customers stop buying? If you're losing 20% of customers per year and don't know it, you're filling a leaky bucket.

Number 10: Net Promoter Score (NPS). How likely are customers to recommend you? This predicts growth better than any other metric."

**Russell Brunson (09:31-10:00)**
"That's comprehensive. But Dan, I can hear people thinking, 'That's a lot to track. Do I really need all of this?' What do you say to them?"

**Dan Kennedy (10:01-15:45)**
"I say grow up. This is business, not a hobby. Would you fly on a plane where the pilot said, 'Nah, I don't need all those instruments. I fly by feel'? Would you have surgery from a doctor who doesn't monitor your vital signs? Then why would you run a business without monitoring its vital signs?

Look, you don't have to track everything on day one. Start with the big three: CLV, CAC, and Conversion Rate. But eventually, yes, you need all of it.

Here's why: Every number tells a story, and together they tell THE story of your business. Let me give you a real example that'll make this clear.

Client comes to me, restaurant owner, says business is slow. 'People just aren't eating out as much,' he says. BS. I make him track everything for 30 days. Here's what we found:

- Foot traffic: Down 5% (not terrible)
- Conversion (walk-in to seated): Down 2% (not the problem)
- Average order value: Down 18% (aha!)
- Specific finding: Appetizer orders down 40%, dessert orders down 60%

The problem wasn't traffic, it was that servers stopped selling appetizers and desserts because the owner cut the commission to save money. He saved $2,000 a month in commissions but lost $28,000 in revenue. That's what happens when you don't measure.

We reinstated commissions, added a contest for most appetizers/desserts sold, revenue went up $35,000 the next month. Same traffic, same restaurant, different numbers.

Here's another example that'll blow your mind. Dentist spending $50,000 a year on Yellow Pages ads. 'It's working great!' he says. I say, 'Prove it.' We implement call tracking. Turns out he's getting 3 calls a month from Yellow Pages. That's $1,388 per call. Of those, one books an appointment. That's $4,166 per appointment. That appointment is worth $275. He's losing $3,891 per patient.

We kill the Yellow Pages, invest $5,000/month in direct mail to his existing patient base asking for referrals. Generates 47 referrals first month, 22 become patients, average value $2,200 each because referred patients buy more comprehensive treatment. That's $48,400 from $5,000.

But here's the kicker - he had been losing money on Yellow Pages for FIVE YEARS. Quarter of a million dollars torched because he didn't measure.

This is why I get angry. This is why I rant. Because measurement isn't optional, it's fundamental. It's the difference between success and failure, between wealth and poverty, between growing and dying."

**Russell Brunson (15:46-16:15)**
"Those examples are insane. A quarter million wasted. So Dan, how do we actually implement measurement? What's the system?"

**Dan Kennedy (16:16-22:30)**
"Good question. Most people know they should measure but don't know how. Here's my step-by-step system:

Step 1: Set up the infrastructure. You need tools. Google Analytics, call tracking, CRM, attribution software. Yes, it costs money. Get over it. You can't manage what you can't measure, and you can't measure without tools.

Basic setup:
- Google Analytics with conversion tracking
- CallRail or similar for call tracking
- CRM like HubSpot or Infusionsoft
- Unique phone numbers for each campaign
- Unique landing pages for each traffic source
- Promo codes for offline marketing

Step 2: Create a Marketing Math Dashboard. One page that shows all your key metrics updated weekly. Not monthly, weekly. Monthly is too slow to catch problems.

My dashboard template:
- This Week | Last Week | Month to Date | Year to Date
- Leads generated
- Cost per lead
- Leads to customers
- Customer acquisition cost
- Average order value
- Customer lifetime value
- Return on ad spend
- Revenue
- Profit

Step 3: Implement Source Tracking. Every lead needs to be tagged with its source. Not just 'Facebook' but 'Facebook - Video Ad - Audience: Business Owners - Campaign: Summer Special.'

Ask every customer, 'How did you hear about us?' But don't trust the answer. People lie or forget. Use tracking URLs, unique phone numbers, promo codes. Belt and suspenders.

Step 4: Calculate True ROI. Not revenue divided by ad spend. That's amateur hour.

True ROI = (Customer Lifetime Value - Customer Acquisition Cost - Fulfillment Cost - Overhead Allocation) / Customer Acquisition Cost

Example: CLV $1,000, CAC $100, Fulfillment $400, Overhead $100. True ROI = ($1,000 - $100 - $400 - $100) / $100 = 300% or 3:1.

Most people would calculate $1,000 / $100 = 10:1 and think they're killing it. But real ROI is 3:1. Still good, but not what they thought.

Step 5: Test and Optimize Based on Data. This is where the magic happens. You don't optimize based on opinions or feelings. You optimize based on numbers.

A/B test everything:
- Headlines (can improve conversion 30-300%)
- Offers (can improve conversion 50-500%)
- Prices (higher prices often convert better)
- Images (can improve CTR 20-200%)
- Call to action (can improve conversion 10-100%)

But here's the key - test one thing at a time and measure the impact. Most people change five things at once and have no idea what worked.

Step 6: Create Feedback Loops. Numbers need to drive action. Weekly marketing meeting reviewing the dashboard. What's working? What's not? What are we changing this week?

If cost per lead goes up 20%, what's the action? If conversion rate drops 10%, what's the response? If lifetime value increases, how do we capitalize?

Without feedback loops, measurement is just mental masturbation. You feel smart looking at numbers but nothing changes."

**Russell Brunson (22:31-23:00)**
"The marketing math dashboard - that's gold. Dan, what about businesses that say they're too small to track all this? The solo entrepreneur, the local shop owner?"

**Dan Kennedy (23:01-28:45)**
"That's exactly who NEEDS to track most! Big businesses can afford waste. Small businesses can't. Every dollar matters when you're small.

Let me tell you about Maria. Runs a hair salon. One chair, no employees, maybe $100K a year. 'I don't need all that fancy tracking,' she says. 'I know my clients.'

I force her to track for 90 days. Just basic stuff:
- Where new clients come from
- How much each client spends
- How often they return
- What services they buy

Here's what she discovered:
- 60% of new clients came from one source: Groupon
- But Groupon clients spent 50% less and returned 70% less often
- Her profit was coming from 20% of clients who bought color services
- She was losing money on 40% of her appointments (travel time to client's homes wasn't worth the fee)

Based on data, she:
- Killed Groupon
- Created a referral program for existing clients
- Raised prices on home visits by 50%
- Created a color service package with higher margins
- Started email marketing to increase visit frequency

Revenue went from $100K to $170K in one year. Same chair, same scissors, same Maria. Different numbers.

Small businesses need measurement MORE, not less. When you're Walmart, you can waste a million dollars and not notice. When you're Maria, wasting $1,000 could mean not making rent.

Here's the minimum viable measurement for small business:

Daily Track:
- How many leads/inquiries?
- Where did they come from?
- How many became customers?
- How much did they spend?

Weekly Calculate:
- Cost per lead by source
- Conversion rate by source
- Average transaction value
- Total revenue and profit

Monthly Analyze:
- Customer lifetime value
- Customer acquisition cost
- Which marketing is profitable?
- What should we stop/start/continue?

That's it. One hour per week maximum. If you can't invest one hour per week to measure your marketing, you deserve to fail. Harsh but true.

And don't give me the 'I'm not good with numbers' excuse. You don't have to be a mathematician. You need to know fourth-grade math. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. If you can calculate a tip at a restaurant, you can measure your marketing."

**Russell Brunson (28:46-29:15)**
"One hour per week to potentially double your business. No excuses. Dan, let's talk about the flip side. What happens when you measure everything religiously?"

**Dan Kennedy (29:16-35:30)**
"Magic happens. Literally magic. You go from hoping to knowing. From guessing to controlling. From reactive to proactive.

Let me tell you about my student Marcus. Runs an online supplement company. Obsessive about measurement. Tracks everything. Has spreadsheets for his spreadsheets. His team thinks he's crazy. Here's what that 'craziness' produced:

Year 1: $500K revenue, breaking even
Year 2: $2.1M revenue, $400K profit
Year 3: $8.7M revenue, $2.1M profit
Year 4: $31M revenue, $8.9M profit
Year 5: Sold the business for $73M

How? Measurement-driven optimization:

- Discovered Facebook customers had 3x lifetime value of Google customers. Shifted budget accordingly.
- Found that customers who bought two products in first 30 days had 85% one-year retention versus 30% for single-product buyers. Created bundles and upsells to encourage multi-product purchases.
- Identified that email sent Tuesday at 10 AM had 40% higher revenue per send than any other time. Moved all promotional emails to that slot.
- Realized phone sales converted at 45% versus 3% for web. Hired phone team, added 'Free consultation' offers to drive calls.
- Tracked that customers who watched a specific video had 4x higher average order value. Made that video mandatory in the funnel.

Hundreds of small optimizations, each driven by data, compounding into exponential growth.

But here's what most people miss - measurement isn't just about optimization. It's about confidence. When you know your numbers, you can make bold decisions.

Marcus knew his customer was worth $312 over 18 months. His competitors thought customers were worth $47 (first purchase only). So Marcus could spend $150 to acquire a customer while competitors capped at $20. He bought all the traffic, dominated the market, competition couldn't figure out how he was profitable.

That's the power of measurement. It's not just information, it's competitive advantage. It's not just data, it's destiny.

Another example: My client Jennifer, runs a coaching business. Tracks everything religiously. Discovers that webinar attendees who ask questions convert at 34% versus 8% for silent attendees.

What does she do? Restructures entire webinar to maximize questions. Gives prizes for best questions. Has assistants private message quiet attendees encouraging questions. Plants questions if necessary. Conversion rate goes from 11% average to 24%. Same webinar, same offer, different interaction model based on data.

Revenue impact: $1.3 million in additional sales in six months. From tracking who asks questions. That's the level of detail that creates wealth."

**Russell Brunson (35:31-36:00)**
"From tracking who asks questions to $1.3 million. Incredible. Dan, what about attribution? That seems to be where everyone gets stuck - figuring out which marketing actually drove the sale."

**Dan Kennedy (36:01-42:00)**
"Attribution is where amateur hour becomes professional. Most businesses use 'last click attribution' - whatever the customer did last gets all the credit. That's like saying the only important player in football is whoever scores the touchdown. What about the quarterback who threw the pass? The lineman who blocked? The coach who called the play?

Marketing is the same. Customer sees Facebook ad, visits website, leaves, sees retargeting ad, subscribes to email, gets 5 emails, sees another Facebook ad, Googles your brand, clicks Google ad, buys. Google gets credit? BS.

Here's my attribution model:

First Touch Attribution (40% credit): What introduced them to you? This is your attraction mechanism. Critical for scaling.

Last Touch Attribution (40% credit): What closed them? This is your conversion mechanism. Critical for profitability.

Assist Attribution (20% credit): Everything in between. The nurturing, the retargeting, the education. Critical for optimization.

Example: Customer journey:
1. Facebook ad (first touch - 40%)
2. Email sequence (assist - 20%)
3. Sales call (last touch - 40%)

Customer value: $1,000
Facebook ad gets credit for: $400
Email gets credit for: $200
Sales call gets credit for: $400

Now you can calculate true ROI for each channel.

But here's the advanced strategy - Multi-Touch Revenue Attribution. Track revenue, not just conversions.

Customer A: Comes from Facebook, buys once for $50, never returns
Customer B: Comes from direct mail, buys monthly for $200, refers 3 friends

Both are one conversion, but vastly different value. If you're not tracking revenue by source over time, you're optimizing for the wrong things.

Real client example: Law firm tracking conversions equally. Google ads: 100 leads/month. Radio: 20 leads/month. They're about to kill radio.

I make them track revenue by source for 6 months:
Google leads: Average case value $3,000
Radio leads: Average case value $18,000

Google: 100 leads x 10% conversion x $3,000 = $30,000
Radio: 20 leads x 25% conversion x $18,000 = $90,000

Radio is 3x more profitable! Why? Radio attracts serious cases, Google attracts tire-kickers. But without measuring revenue attribution, they almost killed their best channel.

This is why you MUST track:
- Source of lead
- Quality of lead (score them)
- Conversion rate by source
- Initial purchase value by source
- Lifetime value by source
- Referral rate by source

Yes, it's complex. Yes, it takes effort. But this is how you build a real business instead of a expensive hobby."

**Russell Brunson (42:01-42:30)**
"Multi-touch revenue attribution - that's next level. Dan, we're running out of time, but I have to ask: What's the biggest measurement mistake you see repeatedly?"

**Dan Kennedy (42:31-47:00)**
"Measuring the wrong things. Vanity metrics instead of value metrics. Let me be crystal clear about this:

Vanity Metrics (Worthless):
- Social media followers
- Website traffic
- Email list size
- Video views
- Likes and comments
- Brand awareness
- Impressions

Value Metrics (Wealth-Creating):
- Customer lifetime value
- Cost per acquisition
- Conversion rate
- Profit per customer
- Return on ad spend
- Market share
- Retention rate

I had a client bragging about his million Facebook followers. I asked, 'How much did you make from them last month?' Crickets. Turns out he was making $3,000/month from a million followers. That's $0.003 per follower. Meanwhile, my email list of 20,000 makes $400,000/month. That's $20 per subscriber.

Which would you rather have? Million followers worth $3,000 or 20,000 subscribers worth $400,000?

But here's the measurement mistake that really pisses me off: Not measuring at all because it's not perfect.

'But Dan, I can't track everything perfectly.' So what? 80% accurate is infinitely better than 0% accurate. Directionally correct beats precisely wrong.

You don't need perfect data, you need good enough data to make better decisions. Start measuring something, anything, today. Then add more measurement tomorrow.

The gym doesn't wait until they have perfect equipment to open. They start with basic weights and add equipment as they grow. Same with measurement. Start basic, get sophisticated over time.

Here's your Day 1 Measurement Checklist:
1. How many leads did I get today?
2. Where did they come from?
3. What did it cost?
4. How many bought?
5. What did they spend?

That's it. Five questions. Write them on a napkin if you have to. But start today.

Because here's the final truth about measurement: Businesses that measure grow. Businesses that don't, die. It's not a maybe, it's a mathematical certainty.

You can't improve what you don't measure. You can't manage what you don't track. You can't scale what you don't understand.

The BIG marketing sin isn't spending too much or too little. It's not using the wrong media or the wrong message. It's marketing in the dark without measurement.

Turn on the lights. Start measuring. Your bank account will thank you."

**Russell Brunson (47:01-47:45)**
"Turn on the lights. Perfect. Dan, this has been one of the most important episodes we've done. If people only listen to one episode, this might be the one. Quick recap: Track everything, focus on value metrics not vanity metrics, use multi-touch attribution, and start today even if it's not perfect.

Next week we're talking about something completely different but equally important - Info Marketing 2.0, how to package and sell your knowledge for massive profits."

**Dan Kennedy (47:46-48:00)**
"Before we wrap, let me leave you with this: Your competitors aren't measuring. That's your opportunity. While they're guessing, you'll be knowing. While they're hoping, you'll be optimizing. While they're losing money and don't know why, you'll be printing money and know exactly why. Measurement is your unfair advantage. Use it."

**Russell Brunson (48:01-48:15)**
"Your unfair advantage. I love it. Thanks Dan. Everyone, go set up your measurement system today. Not tomorrow, today. This is Russell Brunson reminding you that what gets measured gets improved. See you next week."
