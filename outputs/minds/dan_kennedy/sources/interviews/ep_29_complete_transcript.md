# Dan Kennedy's Magnetic Marketing Podcast - Episode 29
## Info Marketing 2.0 Secrets
### Full Episode Transcript (56 minutes)

**Russell Brunson (00:00-00:42)**
"Welcome to Episode 29 of the Magnetic Marketing Podcast, and today we're diving into one of the most profitable business models on the planet - Info Marketing. Dan Kennedy has personally generated over $200 million selling information, and his students have generated billions more. Dan, info marketing has changed a lot since you started. What's working now?"

**Dan Kennedy (00:43-03:30)**
"Russell, when I started in info marketing, we had cassette tapes and three-ring binders. Delivered by mail. Uphill. Both ways. In the snow. [laughs] But seriously, the medium has changed, the principles haven't.

Info marketing is still the best business model on earth. No inventory, no shipping physical products - well, less anyway. Margins of 80-95%. Scalable to the moon. And here's the kicker - people value information more than physical products.

I sell a course for $2,997 that costs me maybe $100 to fulfill digitally. Try getting those margins selling widgets. My consulting clients sell supplements, software, services - they're all jealous of my info business margins.

But here's what's changed - Info Marketing 2.0 as I call it. It's not just about selling information anymore. It's about selling transformation. It's not about what you know, it's about what they become.

The old way: 'Here's my course on Facebook ads.'
The new way: 'Here's how to become the dominant player in your market using my proprietary client-getting system.'

See the difference? One is information, the other is identity. People don't buy information, they buy better versions of themselves."

**Russell Brunson (03:31-04:00)**
"That's huge - transformation versus information. So Dan, let's get practical. Someone listening has expertise but has never sold info products. Where do they start?"

**Dan Kennedy (04:01-09:45)**
"First, let me destroy a myth. 'But Dan, I'm not an expert.' BS. You know something someone else wants to know. That makes you expert enough.

My student Sarah, stay-at-home mom, thought she had no expertise. I asked, 'What do people ask you about?' Turns out, she homeschools her kids and other moms constantly ask her how. She created a $297 homeschooling startup guide. First year: $73,000. From her kitchen table. While homeschooling her kids.

Here's the Info Marketing 2.0 Formula:

Step 1: Identify Your Profitable Expertise
Not what you think people need, what they're already trying to buy. Go to Amazon, look at bestselling books in your field. Go to Udemy, see what courses sell. Go to Facebook groups, see what questions get asked repeatedly.

The sweet spot: High pain, high urgency, disposable income. Weight loss, making money, relationships, specific business skills. My best-selling info product of all time? 'The Ultimate Sales Letter.' Why? Every business needs sales letters, high pain when they don't work, urgent when cash flow is tight.

Step 2: Package Your Knowledge Strategically
Not a brain dump. A transformation system. My formula:
- The Problem (where they are)
- The Promise (where they're going)
- The Process (how to get there)
- The Proof (evidence it works)
- The Price (investment required)

Your package needs all five P's.

Step 3: Create Your Signature System
Not random tips, a proprietary methodology. The 'Kennedy Persuasion Equation.' The 'Magnetic Marketing System.' The 'No B.S. Time Management.'

Give it a name. Make it yours. Even if it's based on existing knowledge. My sales letter system isn't new - it's based on stuff from the 1920s. But my organization, my examples, my voice - that's unique.

Step 4: Build Your Product Pyramid
Never just one product. Always a pyramid:

Bottom: Free content (blog, podcast, YouTube)
Purpose: Attract and qualify prospects

Entry Level: $7-47 (book, mini-course)
Purpose: Convert prospects to buyers

Core Product: $197-997 (comprehensive course)
Purpose: Deliver main transformation

Premium: $1,997-9,997 (advanced training, coaching)
Purpose: Maximum value for serious students

Elite: $25,000+ (mastermind, done-with-you)
Purpose: Intimate access and implementation

Most people start in the middle and wonder why they struggle. You need the full pyramid. The bottom feeds the top.

Step 5: Create Once, Sell Forever
This is the beauty of info marketing. Create the product once, sell it thousands of times. My 'Ultimate Sales Letter' course? Created in 1991. Still selling today. Updated twice. Hundreds of thousands of copies sold.

But here's the 2.0 difference - it's not just the course. It's the ecosystem. Community, software, tools, support. People don't just want information, they want implementation."

**Russell Brunson (09:46-10:15)**
"The product pyramid is so important. I see people trying to sell a $2,000 course to cold traffic and wondering why it doesn't work. Dan, let's talk about the actual creation. How do you create info products that people actually consume and get results from?"

**Dan Kennedy (10:16-16:00)**
"Great question because here's the dirty secret of info marketing - most people don't consume what they buy. Industry average completion rate? Under 10%. That's terrible for refunds, testimonials, and referrals.

My courses have 60-70% completion rates. Here's how:

The Kennedy Course Creation Framework:

Principle 1: Modular Learning
Not one 8-hour course. Eight 1-hour modules. Psychology research shows people can focus for 45-60 minutes max. After that, retention drops off a cliff.

Each module:
- Single topic focus
- Clear outcome
- Action step
- Quick win

Example: My copywriting course. Module 1 isn't 'Introduction to Copywriting.' It's 'Write Your First Million-Dollar Headline in 43 Minutes.' Specific, actionable, time-bound.

Principle 2: Multiple Learning Modalities
People learn differently. Some are visual, some auditory, some kinesthetic. Cover all bases:
- Video lessons (visual + auditory)
- Audio downloads (mobile learning)
- PDF transcripts (readers)
- Worksheets (doers)
- Live Q&A (interactive)

One content, five formats. 5x the perceived value, same creation effort.

Principle 3: Implementation Triggers
Don't just teach, force implementation. Every module needs:
- Pre-work (prime their brain)
- Lesson (deliver information)
- Exercise (practice immediately)
- Assignment (real-world application)
- Share requirement (post results for accountability)

My student Mike teaches Amazon selling. Module 3 assignment: List your first product today. Not someday. Today. Can't move to Module 4 until you show proof. Completion rate: 73%.

Principle 4: Quick Wins Architecture
People need wins fast or they quit. Structure your course so they get a result in the first 48 hours.

My direct mail course: First assignment is write and mail one sales letter. Not perfect, not pretty, just mailed. Students report results within a week. Hooked. They complete everything else.

Principle 5: Community Integration
Learning alone is hard. Learning together is easier. Every course needs a community component:
- Facebook group
- Weekly calls
- Partner matching
- Success sharing

My mastermind has a private Facebook group. 5,000 members. They answer questions before I can. They celebrate wins together. They partner on deals. The community becomes more valuable than the course.

Principle 6: Certification and Status
People love credentials and recognition. Create levels, badges, certificates. Sounds silly? My students pay an extra $497 for a 'Certified Magnetic Marketing Advisor' certificate. It's a PDF. They frame it. They put it on their website. They use it to charge higher fees.

Gaming psychology works. Levels, points, leaderboards, achievements. My student Jenny added gamification to her nutrition course. Completion went from 12% to 67%. Same content, different delivery.

Principle 7: Consumption Campaigns
Don't assume they'll consume. Make them consume. Email sequences, text reminders, consumption challenges.

'Day 1: Watch Module 1'
'Day 3: Submit your assignment'
'Day 7: Share your win'
'Day 14: Ready for Module 2?'

Drip the content. Lock modules until previous ones are complete. Force linear progression. It's for their own good."

**Russell Brunson (16:01-16:30)**
"Consumption campaigns - that's genius. Force them to succeed. Dan, let's talk money. How do you price info products? I see everything from $7 ebooks to $100,000 masterminds."

**Dan Kennedy (16:31-22:45)**
"Pricing is where amateurs become professionals. Most people price based on cost or competition. Wrong and wrong.

You price based on value and positioning. Let me break this down:

The Value Equation:
Price = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay × Effort Required)

Example: Weight loss product
Dream Outcome: Lose 30 pounds (High value)
Perceived Likelihood: 90% success rate with proof (High)
Time Delay: 90 days (Medium)
Effort Required: 30 minutes daily (Low)

High value, high likelihood, reasonable time, low effort = High price justified.

Now positioning. Same information, different positioning, 10x price difference:

'How to Write Better' - $47 ebook
'Business Writing That Sells' - $297 course
'Executive Communication Mastery' - $2,997 program
'C-Suite Presentation Excellence' - $25,000 workshop

Same core content. Different audience, different promise, different price.

Here's my pricing strategy:

The 10X Value Rule
Your product should deliver 10X the value of its price. $1,000 course should create $10,000 in value. Not hard with information. My $2,997 copywriting course - students average $47,000 in additional revenue first year. That's 15X.

The Expensive Expert Position
You want to be the expensive option. Not the most expensive (that's suspicious), but expensive enough to signal quality.

Three competitors price at $497, $697, $997. You price at $1,497. You're the premium option. 20% of market always buys premium. Better to have 100 customers at $1,497 than 200 at $497. Same revenue, half the work, better customers.

The Price Anchoring Strategy
Always show a higher price first. My funnel:
- Mastermind: $25,000/year (anchor)
- Coaching: $5,000/month (looks reasonable now)
- Course: $2,997 (bargain!)
- Book: $47 (impulse buy)

Start high, work down. Psychology 101.

The Payment Plan Premium
Offer payment plans but charge more. $2,997 paid in full or 6 payments of $597. That's $3,582, a $585 premium. 60% take payment plan. Extra $351 per customer average.

The Urgency Escalator
Price goes up over time. Launch price $997. After 100 sales, $1,297. After 200 sales, $1,497. Creates real urgency. Shows confidence. Rewards fast action.

The Bundle Breakthrough
Never sell one thing. Always bundle. Course alone: Hard to sell at $997. Course + software + templates + community + bonuses: Easy to sell at $1,497.

My current bundle:
- Core course ($2,997 value)
- Software toolkit ($997 value)
- Template library ($497 value)
- Monthly Q&A calls ($1,997 value)
- Private Facebook group ($997 value)
- 30-day email support ($1,500 value)

Total value: $8,985
Price: $2,997
Savings: $5,988

Nobody calculates actual value. They see big number, smaller number, buy.

The Trial Close Technique
Let them try before full commitment. $1 trial for 30 days, then $297/month for 6 months. Looks like $1 but it's $1,783. Conversion rate 5x higher than straight $1,783 price."

**Russell Brunson (22:46-23:15)**
"The 10X value rule is my favorite. If you can't articulate 10X value, don't sell it. Dan, what about delivery? Digital versus physical? Membership versus one-time? What's working best?"

**Dan Kennedy (23:16-29:00)**
"The answer is both/and, not either/or. The biggest mistake in Info Marketing 2.0 is going all digital. Physical products still have massive perceived value.

My product mix:
- Digital course (convenience)
- Physical box (perception)
- Monthly newsletter (continuity)
- Live events (connection)
- Software tools (implementation)

Different buyers want different things. Some want everything digital on their phone. Others want books and binders they can hold. Give them options.

The Shock and Awe Box
When someone buys my $2,997 course, they get a 20-pound box. DVDs, manuals, CDs, templates, bonus reports. Costs me $147 to ship. Worth every penny.

Why? Psychology. Weight equals worth. Big box equals big value. They post unboxing videos. Free marketing. They display it on their shelf. Social proof. They're less likely to refund something physical.

Digital delivery same day. Physical box arrives 3 days later. Two dopamine hits. Double the excitement.

The Continuity Component
One-time sales are hard. Continuity is easy money. Every info product needs a continuity component.

My model:
- Core course: $2,997 one time
- Monthly membership: $97/month
- Annual intensive: $5,000/year

Average customer value Year 1: $4,161
Without continuity: $2,997

That extra $1,164 per customer is pure profit. Same customers, more money.

The Hybrid Model
Don't choose between membership and course. Do both.

Course: Front-end sale, big money fast
Membership: Back-end continuity, steady income

My student Rachel: $1,997 course with $197/month membership. 40% of course buyers join membership. Average retention 11 months.

Math: $1,997 + ($197 × 11 × 0.4) = $2,863 per customer

The Ascending Subscription
Start low, increase over time. Month 1-3: $47. Month 4-6: $97. Month 7+: $197.

Reduces initial resistance. By the time price increases, they're hooked. Retention actually improves because of sunk cost fallacy.

The Stack and Switch
Sell lifetime access, deliver monthly. '$2,997 lifetime access' but content drips monthly. Feels like one-time purchase, acts like subscription.

The All-Access Pass
My best innovation: All-Access Pass. $5,000/year, everything I create included. Courses, events, masterminds, everything.

1,200 members × $5,000 = $6 million recurring

They stop comparing individual product prices. They just renew annually. 87% retention rate."

**Russell Brunson (29:01-29:30)**
"The All-Access Pass is brilliant. Predictable revenue changes everything. Dan, let's talk about actually selling info products. What's your launch formula?"

**Dan Kennedy (29:31-36:30)**
"Launches are theater. P.T. Barnum would be proud of what we do today. Internet marketing is the circus of the 21st century, and we're the ringmasters.

The Kennedy Launch Formula - Seven Phase System:

Phase 1: Pre-Prelaunch (60 days out)
Start telling stories about the problem. Don't mention product. Just agitate pain.

'Had a student yesterday struggling with...'
'Shocking study just came out about...'
'Can't believe what I just discovered...'

Building pressure without relief. They don't know a solution is coming, but they feel the problem acutely.

Phase 2: Prelaunch (30 days out)
Announce something is coming. No details. Just anticipation.

'Working on something big...'
'Can't wait to share this with you...'
'Game-changer coming soon...'

Create mystery. Humans hate open loops. They'll check daily for updates.

Phase 3: Early Bird List (21 days out)
Let them raise their hand for early access.

'Want first dibs? Get on the early bird list.'

No commitment, just interest. But psychologically, they've started saying yes.

Phase 4: Content Sequence (14 days out)
Free training that sells without selling.

Video 1: The Problem (why they're stuck)
Video 2: The Possibility (what's possible)
Video 3: The Process (overview of solution)
Video 4: The Pitch (here's how to get it)

Jeff Walker calls it Product Launch Formula. I was doing it with direct mail in the '80s. Works every time.

Phase 5: Launch Week (7 days)
Orchestrated chaos. Emails, videos, bonuses, deadlines.

Day 1: Doors open (excitement)
Day 2: Case studies (proof)
Day 3: FAQ (objection handling)
Day 4: Bonus announcement (value add)
Day 5: 48-hour warning (urgency)
Day 6: Last chance (scarcity)
Day 7: Doors closing (final push)

Seven touches in seven days. Seems like a lot? Top launches do 3-4 emails per day final 48 hours.

Phase 6: Launch Extension (The Encore)
'Due to overwhelming demand...'
'My team convinced me...'
'Last chance for real this time...'

Always extend 24-48 hours. Procrastinators need one more chance. Extra 20-30% in sales.

Phase 7: Downsell Sequence (Post-Launch)
Didn't buy at $2,997? How about payment plan? Still no? How about just Module 1 for $297? Still no? How about my book for $47?

Someone who watched all your videos is a buyer. Find their price point.

Real Launch Numbers:
My last course launch:
- List size: 50,000
- Early bird list: 8,000 (16%)
- Watched videos: 12,000 (24%)
- Bought in launch: 1,847 (3.7%)
- Revenue: $5.5 million
- Launch costs: $73,000
- Profit: $5.4+ million

But here's the 2.0 difference - Perpetual Launch Model.

Old way: Launch twice a year, feast or famine
New way: Evergreen funnel, launching every day

Same videos, same sequence, but automated. New leads enter funnel daily. Their launch starts when they're ready, not when you are.

My evergreen funnel: $400K/month on autopilot. No live launches. No stress. No feast or famine."

**Russell Brunson (36:31-37:00)**
"Perpetual launch model - that's the future. Always launching to someone. Dan, what about credibility? How does someone with no track record sell info products?"

**Dan Kennedy (37:01-43:00)**
"Great question because everyone starts at zero. I started with no credibility. Living in a crappy apartment. Driving a rusted Dodge. Nobody knew who Dan Kennedy was.

Here's how you build credibility from nothing:

The Borrowed Credibility Strategy
Can't sell your expertise? Sell someone else's. Interview experts, package their knowledge.

My student Tom, 23 years old, no experience. Interviewed 20 successful Amazon sellers. Packaged as 'Amazon Millions Summit.' Sold access for $297. Made $47,000 first month. Now he's the expert by association.

The Case Study Method
You don't need to be the hero. Be the guide. Document someone else's success using your method.

'How I Helped Bob Go From $100K to $1M in 12 Months'

You're not claiming you made a million. You're showing you can help others. Big difference.

The Demonstration Principle
Show, don't tell. Instead of claiming expertise, demonstrate it.

My student Lisa, wanted to teach Facebook ads. No clients yet. Ran ads for local restaurant for free. Generated 200 reservations in a week. Documented everything. Used that case study to sell $50K in courses.

The Micro-Specialization Method
Can't compete as generalist? Become the specialist.

Not 'Facebook ads expert' but 'Facebook ads for dentists'
Not 'Weight loss coach' but 'Post-pregnancy weight loss for executives'
Not 'Business consultant' but 'Systems for 7-figure HVAC companies'

Narrower niche, easier to dominate, higher prices.

The Results in Advance Technique
Give them results before they buy. Prove you can help.

Free workshop where you solve real problems
Challenge where they get specific outcome
Audit where you show them opportunities

My student Mark does free 'Profit Acceleration Workshops' for local businesses. 90 minutes, finds them $10K-50K in hidden revenue. Half hire him at $5K/month. Others buy his course for $997.

The Strategic Association Method
Attach yourself to recognized authorities.

'Featured in...' (any publication that mentioned you)
'Clients include...' (any recognizable names)
'Trained by...' (any guru you learned from)
'Member of...' (any relevant organization)

I put 'Jay Abraham Strategic Partner' on everything early on. Was I? I attended his seminar and we had lunch. Strategic enough for me.

The Rapid Results Timeline
Credibility compounds quickly if you're strategic.

Month 1: Pick your niche, create foundational content
Month 2: Get 3 case studies (free if necessary)
Month 3: Launch beta course to 10 people at 50% off
Month 4: Collect testimonials, refine product
Month 5: Official launch at full price
Month 6: $10K+ month from product you didn't have 6 months ago

The Platform Building Blueprint
You need a platform, but not a huge one.

Email list: 1,000 targeted subscribers > 100K random
Facebook group: 500 engaged members > 50K lurkers
YouTube channel: 100 videos with 100 views > 1 video with 10K
Podcast: 50 episodes with 50 downloads > hoping for viral

Consistency beats intensity. Daily content for a year and you're an expert by default."

**Russell Brunson (43:01-43:30)**
"Borrowed credibility is so smart. Nobody starts as the expert. Dan, what mistakes do you see info marketers making that kill their business?"

**Dan Kennedy (43:31-49:30)**
"Oh boy, where do I start? Let me give you the top five business-killers:

Mistake #1: Information Overload Delivery
Trying to prove value by overwhelming them. 72-hour course with 1,000 page manual. Nobody wants that. They want transformation, not a PhD.

My rule: Minimum Effective Dose. What's the least they need to know to get the result? Deliver that. Save the rest for upsells.

Mistake #2: Solving the Wrong Problem
Creating what you think they need, not what they want to buy.

They want: Six-pack abs in 30 days
You create: Comprehensive nutrition and exercise science

They want: Make $10K next month
You create: Build sustainable business over 5 years

Sell them what they want, give them what they need. Trojan horse strategy.

Mistake #3: Underpricing from Fear
'Nobody will pay $2,000 for my course.'

Meanwhile, people pay:
- $200K for college teaching theory
- $50K for Tony Robbins mastermind
- $5K for one day with consultant
- $500 for concert tickets

Your knowledge that can change their life? Priceless. Charge accordingly.

Mistake #4: One Hit Wonder Syndrome
Create one course, expect to retire. Doesn't work that way.

Info marketing is a business, not a lottery ticket. You need:
- Multiple products
- Multiple price points
- Multiple marketing channels
- Multiple revenue streams

My business: 47 products, 7 price points, 12 marketing channels, 23 revenue streams. That's stability.

Mistake #5: Ignoring the Back-End
Obsessing over new customers while ignoring existing ones.

My revenue breakdown:
- New customers: 20%
- Existing customers buying more: 50%
- Past customers reactivating: 30%

80% of revenue from people who already bought. Yet 90% of effort goes to new acquisition. Backwards.

The Advanced Mistakes:

Not Building a Personal Brand
People buy from people, not companies. Especially in info marketing.

You need:
- Origin story (where you came from)
- Mission statement (what you stand for)
- Enemy declaration (what you fight against)
- Unique voice (how you communicate)
- Visual identity (how you look)

I'm the 'No B.S. Marketing Guy.' Suit and tie. Contrarian. Blunt. Love horses. Hate time wasters. That's a brand.

Not Creating Intellectual Property
Repackaging others' ideas isn't enough. Create your own frameworks.

My IP:
- Magnetic Marketing System
- Three M's Formula
- Kennedy Persuasion Equation
- Planet Dan philosophical framework

This IP becomes valuable. I license it. Others teach it. It lives beyond me.

Not Building Strategic Partnerships
Trying to do everything alone. You need:
- Affiliate partners (traffic)
- Joint venture partners (credibility)
- Technology partners (tools)
- Fulfillment partners (delivery)
- Coaching partners (implementation)

My JV with GKIC generates millions I wouldn't get alone.

Not Systemizing the Business
Running on hustle instead of systems.

You need SOPs for:
- Product creation
- Launch execution
- Customer support
- Affiliate management
- Content production

My team can launch a product without me. That's freedom.

Not Planning the Exit
Building a job, not an asset.

Info businesses sell for 3-5x annual profit if structured right. My student sold his info business for $12 million. Started in his basement 7 years earlier.

Requirements for sellable info business:
- Not dependent on founder
- Recurring revenue
- Systematic operations
- Diverse traffic sources
- Proven team

Build to sell even if you never do."

**Russell Brunson (49:31-50:00)**
"Build to sell even if you never do. That's powerful. Dan, we're almost out of time, but I have to ask - with AI and free content everywhere, is info marketing still viable?"

**Dan Kennedy (50:01-55:30)**
"[Laughs] Russell, people have been declaring info marketing dead since I started. First it was 'the internet will make information free.' Then YouTube. Then Google. Now AI.

Here's what they don't understand: We don't sell information. We sell implementation. We sell transformation. We sell community. We sell accountability. We sell curation. We sell speed to result.

AI makes info marketing MORE valuable, not less. Why? Information overload is worse than ever. People don't need more information, they need the RIGHT information in the RIGHT order with the RIGHT support.

Example: ChatGPT can write sales copy. But can it:
- Understand your specific market's psychology?
- Know which words trigger buying in your niche?
- Provide feedback on your specific implementation?
- Connect you with others solving same problem?
- Hold you accountable to actually do it?
- Give you confidence you're on the right track?

No. That's what we provide.

The AI Opportunity for Info Marketers:

Use AI as Your Assistant
- Create content faster
- Personalize at scale
- Answer questions 24/7
- Generate variations
- Research topics

My team uses AI to create first drafts. I add expertise, personality, stories. 10x productivity.

Position Against AI
'Why AI Can't Replace [Your Solution]'
'The Human Touch in [Your Industry]'
'What AI Gets Wrong About [Your Topic]'

Differentiation through humanity.

Create AI-Enhanced Products
Course + AI tool that implements teachings
Community + AI coach for personal guidance
Templates + AI that customizes them

Higher value, higher prices.

The Future of Info Marketing:

Trend 1: Ultra-Specialization
Not 'marketing' but 'TikTok ads for cosmetic dentists in Texas'

Trend 2: Implementation Focus
Not just teaching but doing with them or for them

Trend 3: Community-Driven
The group becomes more valuable than content

Trend 4: Credential Creation
Everyone wants certification, accreditation, degrees

Trend 5: AI Integration
Human expertise enhanced by AI tools

The Opportunity:
More people want to learn online than ever. Pandemic proved it. E-learning market: $400+ billion by 2026.

More people have expertise to share than ever. Everyone's an expert at something.

More tools to create and deliver than ever. Course platforms, community software, payment processing, all easy.

Lower barriers to entry but higher bar for success. Anyone can create a course. Few can create transformation.

That's your opportunity. While others create information, you create transformation. While others use AI to replace themselves, you use it to amplify yourself.

Info Marketing isn't dying. It's evolving. And evolution favors those who adapt.

My prediction: The next decade will create more info marketing millionaires than the last three decades combined. The question isn't whether info marketing is viable. It's whether you're going to claim your piece of the $400 billion pie.

The formula hasn't changed:
Find a hungry market
Create a transformational solution
Price based on value
Deliver with excellence
Scale through systems

Do that, and AI becomes your friend, not your enemy. Free content becomes your lead generation, not your competition. The future becomes your opportunity, not your threat.

Info Marketing 2.0 isn't about selling information. It's about changing lives. And that, Russell, will never go out of style."

**Russell Brunson (55:31-56:00)**
"That will never go out of style. Dan, this has been one of our most valuable episodes. Info marketing is not just viable, it's the opportunity of the decade. Everyone listening has expertise someone needs. Package it, price it right, and change lives while building wealth.

Next week, we're diving into 'No B.S. Direct Marketing' - the fundamental principles that make everything else work. Dan, final words?"

**Dan Kennedy (56:01-56:15)**
"Stop learning, start creating. You know enough. You are enough. Someone needs what you know. Package it, price it, promote it. Your info marketing empire starts with the first product. Create it this week, not someday. Someday is the enemy of success."

**Russell Brunson (56:16-56:30)**
"Someday is the enemy of success. Everyone, your homework: Outline your first info product today. This is Russell Brunson reminding you that your knowledge is valuable. Share it. Sell it. Change lives with it. See you next week!"
