## Transcript

**Russell Brunson:** Welcome back to Dan Kennedy's Magnetic Marketing Podcast. Today, Dan is going to reveal what he calls "The BIG Marketing Sin" - a mistake so common and so devastating that it kills more businesses than any other single factor.

This isn't about tactics or techniques. This is about a fundamental flaw in thinking that destroys even the best marketing efforts. Here's Dan Kennedy.

**Dan Kennedy:** I'm going to start today with a confession that might shock you.

I've personally consulted with over 500 businesses in my career. I've worked with companies doing everything from $50,000 a year to $500 million a year. And in almost every case, they were committing the same deadly sin.

This sin is so pervasive, so accepted, so "normal" that most business owners don't even recognize they're committing it. They think it's just "how business is done."

But it's killing their profits, destroying their growth potential, and keeping them trapped in a cycle of feast or famine.

**The BIG Marketing Sin Revealed**

The BIG Marketing Sin is this: **Marketing without measurement.**

That's it. Simple, right? But don't let the simplicity fool you. This single mistake has destroyed more businesses, wasted more money, and caused more frustration than every other marketing mistake combined.

**What Marketing Without Measurement Looks Like**

Let me paint you a picture of how this sin manifests:

You run an ad. People see it. Some respond. You make some sales. You think, "That worked pretty well." So you run it again. Or maybe you try something different because you're "creative."

You have a website. You get traffic. Some people buy. You assume it's "working" because money is coming in.

You do networking. You meet people. Sometimes they become customers. You keep networking because it "seems to work."

You send emails. You post on social media. You do direct mail. You try Google ads. Some of it works, some doesn't. You keep doing what feels right.

Sound familiar? Congratulations - you're committing the BIG Marketing Sin.

**Why This Is a Sin**

Here's why marketing without measurement is not just a mistake - it's a sin against your own success:

**1. You're Flying Blind**
Without measurement, you have no idea what's actually working. You might think something is successful when it's actually losing money. Or you might abandon something that's profitable because you can't see the results clearly.

**2. You Can't Improve**
If you don't know exactly how something performed, you can't make it better. You're stuck with whatever results you accidentally achieve.

**3. You Can't Scale**
Without measurement, you don't know which marketing activities to invest more money in. You might put more money into the worst-performing activities and starve the best ones.

**4. You Waste Massive Amounts of Money**
This is the big one. Unmeasured marketing is just expensive hope. You're literally gambling with your marketing budget.

**The True Cost of This Sin**

Let me give you a real example. I worked with a restaurant owner who was spending $5,000 a month on various marketing activities:

- $2,000 on yellow pages ads
- $1,500 on radio advertising
- $1,000 on direct mail
- $500 on newspaper ads

He thought everything was "working okay" because the restaurant was busy.

When we implemented proper measurement, here's what we discovered:

- Yellow pages: $2,000 spent, generated $800 in profit = **$1,200 LOSS**
- Radio: $1,500 spent, generated $600 in profit = **$900 LOSS**
- Direct mail: $1,000 spent, generated $4,200 in profit = **$3,200 PROFIT**
- Newspaper: $500 spent, generated $200 in profit = **$300 LOSS**

He was losing $2,400 per month on three activities while making $3,200 on one. Net profit from marketing: $800.

After we eliminated the losing activities and tripled the investment in direct mail, his marketing generated $9,600 in profit per month instead of $800.

That's the difference between measurement and guessing.

**The Elements of Proper Measurement**

Real marketing measurement requires tracking five key elements:

**1. Source Tracking**
Where did each customer come from? Not just "online" or "advertising," but specifically which ad, which keyword, which piece of mail, which email.

Every marketing activity must be coded so you know exactly what generated each response.

**2. Cost Tracking**
What did it cost to generate each lead and each customer from each source? Include all costs - creative, production, media, labor, everything.

**3. Conversion Tracking**
What percentage of leads from each source actually become customers? This varies dramatically between sources and tells you about lead quality, not just quantity.

**4. Revenue Tracking**
How much immediate revenue does each source generate? Not just number of customers, but dollar value per customer.

**5. Lifetime Value Tracking**
What's the long-term value of customers from each source? Some sources generate customers who buy once and disappear. Others generate customers who buy repeatedly for years.

**The Measurement System**

Here's the system I use with every client:

**Step 1: Unique Identification**
Every marketing piece gets a unique identifier. Different phone numbers, different landing pages, different offer codes. No exceptions.

**Step 2: Lead Capture**
Every inquiry is captured with source information. Where they came from, when they responded, what offer they responded to.

**Step 3: Customer Tracking**
When leads become customers, their source information follows them. You always know where every customer originated.

**Step 4: Revenue Attribution**
Every dollar of revenue is attributed back to its original source. This includes repeat purchases and referrals.

**Step 5: ROI Calculation**
Regular reports showing cost per lead, cost per customer, revenue per customer, and return on investment for every marketing activity.

**The Tools You Need**

You don't need expensive software. You need:

**1. Separate Phone Numbers**
Use different phone numbers for different marketing pieces. Track which number each call comes from.

**2. Coded Coupons or Offers**
Different offer codes for different sources. "Mention code RADIO15" vs "Mention code MAIL20."

**3. Unique Landing Pages**
Different web pages for different traffic sources. Each URL tells you where the visitor came from.

**4. Customer Database**
A simple system for tracking customer information including original source.

**5. Regular Reporting**
Weekly or monthly reports showing performance of each marketing activity.

**Common Measurement Mistakes**

Even when businesses try to measure, they often make these mistakes:

**1. Measuring Activity Instead of Results**
"We sent 10,000 emails" is not a measurement. "We sent 10,000 emails, got 200 clicks, 50 leads, and 12 customers for a total revenue of $6,000" is a measurement.

**2. Looking Only at Immediate Results**
Some marketing activities pay off over time. You need to track lifetime value, not just immediate sales.

**3. Measuring the Wrong Things**
"Brand awareness" and "impressions" don't pay the bills. Focus on leads, customers, and revenue.

**4. Not Tracking All Costs**
Many businesses only track media costs but ignore creative, labor, and management time.

**5. Inconsistent Tracking**
Measurement must be systematic and consistent. You can't measure some things sometimes and expect useful data.

**The Attribution Challenge**

One of the biggest measurement challenges is attribution. Customers rarely buy immediately after seeing one ad. They might see your ad, visit your website, read reviews, talk to friends, then buy weeks later.

Here's how to handle this:

**First Touch Attribution**: Credit the first marketing touch that brought them into your funnel.

**Last Touch Attribution**: Credit the final marketing touch before they bought.

**Multi-Touch Attribution**: Give partial credit to all touches in the customer journey.

For most small businesses, I recommend first touch attribution because it tells you what's bringing new prospects into your system.

**The Testing Framework**

Once you have measurement in place, you can test systematically:

**1. Test One Element at a Time**
Change only one thing - headline, offer, media, timing. Multiple changes make it impossible to know what caused different results.

**2. Run Tests Simultaneously**
Test A vs Test B at the same time, not sequentially. Market conditions change.

**3. Test Until Statistical Significance**
Small differences might be random. You need enough responses to know if differences are real.

**4. Implement Winners Quickly**
When you find something that works better, implement it immediately across all appropriate marketing.

**The Compound Effect**

Here's the power of systematic measurement and testing:

If you improve your marketing results by just 10% in five different areas:
- 10% more leads
- 10% better conversion rate
- 10% higher average transaction
- 10% more repeat purchases
- 10% more referrals

The compound effect is: 1.10 × 1.10 × 1.10 × 1.10 × 1.10 = 61% improvement in total results.

Small, measured improvements compound into massive results.

**The Accountability Factor**

Measurement creates accountability. When you know exactly what each marketing activity costs and produces, you can't fool yourself anymore.

You can't justify poor-performing activities because they "feel right" or because you've "always done them."

The numbers don't lie. They force you to confront reality and make better decisions.

**Getting Started**

If you're currently committing the BIG Marketing Sin, here's how to stop:

**This Week:**
1. List every marketing activity you're currently doing
2. Estimate how much each one costs (total cost, not just media)
3. Estimate how many customers each one generates
4. Calculate rough ROI for each activity

**Next Week:**
1. Set up unique tracking for your top 3 marketing activities
2. Start capturing source information for all new leads
3. Create a simple tracking spreadsheet

**Within 30 Days:**
1. Have complete measurement system in place
2. Generate your first real ROI report
3. Eliminate clearly unprofitable activities
4. Increase investment in profitable activities

**The Bottom Line**

Marketing without measurement isn't marketing - it's gambling. And the house always wins when you're gambling.

Every dollar you spend on marketing should be trackable, measurable, and accountable. If you can't measure it, don't do it.

This isn't just about efficiency or optimization. This is about survival. In today's competitive marketplace, you can't afford to waste money on unmeasured marketing activities.

Your competitors who master measurement will outspend you, out-test you, and out-profit you. They'll know exactly what works while you're still guessing.

Stop committing the BIG Marketing Sin. Start measuring everything. Your business depends on it.

Remember: If you're not measuring, you're not marketing - you're just hoping.
