DAN KENNEDY ORIGINAL SAMPLES
Collected from verified sources

SAMPLE 1: Classic "Who Else Wants" Headline
-----------------------------------------
"Who Else Wants To Laugh At Money Worries -
Without Winning The Lottery?"

Dear Friend,

If you're like most business owners, you're frustrated by
advertising that doesn't work, marketing that costs more than
it brings in, and the constant struggle to attract good customers.

You've probably tried everything - Yellow Pages, newspaper ads,
even those expensive radio spots. And nothing seems to work.

Well, I have good news...

[Signature Dan Kennedy opening structure]

================================

SAMPLE 2: Problem-Agitate-Solve Formula
-----------------------------------------
THE PROBLEM:
Most business owners are literally bleeding money from their
advertising. They're throwing good money after bad, hoping
something will stick.

THE AGITATION:
And it's getting worse. Competition is fiercer than ever.
Customers are more skeptical. Traditional advertising costs
are skyrocketing while response rates plummet.

THE SOLUTION:
That's why I created the Magnetic Marketing System - a complete,
proven system that attracts customers to you like a magnet
attracts iron filings.

SAMPLE 3: Kennedy's 10 Smart Questions
-----------------------------------------
Before you write a single word of copy, answer these:

1. What keeps them awake at night, indigestion boiling up
   their esophagus, eyes open, staring at the ceiling?

2. What are they afraid of?

3. What are they angry about? Who are they angry at?

4. What are their top three daily frustrations?

5. What trends are occurring and will occur in their
   businesses or lives?

6. What do they secretly, ardently desire most?

7. Is there a built-in bias to the way they make decisions?

8. Do they have their own language or jargon?

9. Who else is selling something similar to them?

10. Who else has tried selling them something similar,
    and how has that effort failed?

SAMPLE 4: Classic Kennedy P.S. Stack
-----------------------------------------
P.S. Remember, this offer includes not just the main system,
but also three fast-action bonuses worth $497. But only if
you respond within the next 72 hours.

P.P.S. I almost forgot - you're also protected by my Better-
Than-Risk-Free Triple Guarantee. You literally cannot lose.

P.P.P.S. Last week, Jim Sanders from Ohio used just one
technique from page 47 and generated an extra $4,200 in
sales. What could it do for you?

P.P.P.P.S. Only 500 copies available at this special price.
When they're gone, the price goes up to $297. As of this
morning, we have just 237 left.

================================

SAMPLE 5: Takeaway Selling
-----------------------------------------
Now, I need to be honest with you...

This ISN'T for everyone.

In fact, I only want to work with 12 serious business owners
this month. If you're looking for magic pills or get-rich-quick
schemes, this ISN'T for you.

But if you're serious about multiplying your business...
if you're ready to implement proven systems... and if you
can follow simple instructions...

Then you need to act now, because those 12 spots will be
gone fast.

================================

SAMPLE 6: The Godfather Offer
-----------------------------------------
I'm going to make you an offer you can't refuse...

Try my Magnetic Marketing System for 60 days.

If you don't see AT LEAST a 300% return on your investment
in that time, I'll not only refund every penny...

I'll also send you a check for $100 just for wasting your time.

That's right - you'll actually MAKE money if this doesn't work.

Why would I make such a crazy offer?

Simple: I'm that confident this will transform your business.
