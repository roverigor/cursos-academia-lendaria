Subject: Your spot has been released...

Dear [First Name],

I wanted to let you know that I've released your spot in the
Magnetic Marketing Implementation Bootcamp.

When we spoke last week, you seemed interested but hadn't made
a decision yet.

Since I only accept 12 people per month (to ensure everyone
gets personal attention), and I have 27 people on the waiting
list, I had to release your spot to someone else.

However...

The person I offered it to needs until tomorrow at 5 PM to
confirm.

If they don't take it (about a 30% chance based on past
experience), the spot will be yours if you want it.

But you need to let me know by tomorrow at 4 PM.

After that, I'm moving to the next person on the list.

Just to remind you what you get:

- 12 weeks of intensive implementation coaching
- My complete Magnetic Marketing System ($3,000 value)
- Direct access to me via our private hotline
- 47 proven marketing campaigns you can swipe
- The "Emergency Cash" protocol for quick revenue

The investment is $497/month for 3 months.

Or pay in full ($1,197) and save $294.

If the spot becomes available and you want it, reply to this
email by 4 PM tomorrow with "YES - HOLD MY SPOT."

If I don't hear from you, I'll assume you're not interested
and won't bother you again about this.

Dan Kennedy

P.S. I should mention - the last group averaged a 312% ROI
within the first 90 days. But that doesn't matter if you
don't have a spot.

P.P.S. If you're not interested, please let me know so I
can remove you from the waiting list. I hate wasting time -
mine and yours.
