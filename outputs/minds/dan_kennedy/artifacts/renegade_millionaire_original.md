system was & frankly still is, his signature product. Magnetic Marketing was his first, but Renegade Millionaire is what really imprinted Dan's brand & personality in his marketing. It was smartly taped in interview format & named to position Dan as the renegade marketer to follow. Since then, he's released a Renegade Millionaire time management system & most recently, a recession-made Renegade Millionaire course. The way Dan masterfully re-purposes & renews old content is very worthy of studying in itself, but in this case, let's focus in on his original pitch. The way Dan starts the letter is asking "Who else wants to be a Renegade Millionaire?" In other words, he's making the reader feel like they can join his exclusive club and become just like him, calling it a "radical underground" & "secret society" throughout the letter. He then immediately points out the elephant in the room (the size of the letter) & why it's so long to ensure people get through it. The next part of the letter where Dan gets into the story of "Think & Grow Rich" is my favorite part though. This is a book probably 90% of his audience has read and he brings it up to illustrate that his product is just like it, but better because Dan has the experience Napoleon Hill didn't. HUGE Statement & positioning. Other favorite parts of mine include an extensive highlighted list of everything Dan's been through, photos of interviewer Lee Milter drowning in the vast amount of material she studied before interviewing him, and last but not least, a reminder of your life expectancy in case you were wondering how much longer you have to live out your dreams. Gotta love Dan.
