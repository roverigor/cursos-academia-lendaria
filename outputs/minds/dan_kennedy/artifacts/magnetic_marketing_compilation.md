he teaches is an absolute goldmine & below are the ads Dan drew inspiration from to help rake in millions of dollars from his very first product.
Dan’s signature product, Magnetic Marketing, was first introduced back in the ‘70s. Since then, he’s created well over 50 high-priced information products. Yet, Magnetic Marketing is still his best selling product to date and he continuously cashes in on it by creating new editions & spinoffs.
I can tell you with absolute certainty how he came up with the branding for this multi-million dollar product.
Dan has openly admitted to swiping the idea for “Magnetic Marketing” directly from ads selling Personal Magnetism, from the 1920s. We hunted down them down & they're showcased below.
It's a great example of swiping an idea from old sources many would gloss over. Dan knows there is a lot of value in classic ads. He took an old idea & made it work brilliantly in a completely different niche.
