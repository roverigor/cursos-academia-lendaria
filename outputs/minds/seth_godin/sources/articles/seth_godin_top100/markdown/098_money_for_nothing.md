A friend asked me for some ways to make money. (All direct quotes).

“Can I do okay taking those surveys where they pay me?”

“What about buying or trading shirts from Supreme and then selling them?”

“Do you think I can get paid $50 an hour to be a dog walker?”

“Is listening to some famous person and investing in an ICO a shortcut to riches?”

The thing is, almost all the easy shortcuts are taken. And the problem is that the ones that aren’t taken are hiding really well among a forest of scams and ripoffs. [Please read this before you invest in any ICO or Bitcoin-related offering. Run away!]

“Where do I find a publisher who will pay me a big advance for my first novel?”

Your best work isn’t nothing, it’s the heart of what you have to offer. Finding the long, difficult way is worth the journey, because it’s the best way to get what you deserve.
