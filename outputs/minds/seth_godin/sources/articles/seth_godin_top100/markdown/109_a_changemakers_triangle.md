The instigator is the author, the dreamer, the writer. She creates a screenplay, founds a non-profit, says what needs to be said.

The editor curates. Picks and chooses. Amplifies the essential and deletes the rest.

And the publisher scales it. Turns it into a business or a success on some other metric.

Throughout the ages, there have been world-class editors. Sometimes they get the authors they deserve, sometimes not. And there have always been great publishers, turning worthy (and sometimes less than worthy) ideas into successes.

If you’re a maker of change, you might resort to being your own editor and your own publisher. After all, the ideas must be brought forward. If you can, though, see if you can find the editor and the publisher your work is worthy of.
