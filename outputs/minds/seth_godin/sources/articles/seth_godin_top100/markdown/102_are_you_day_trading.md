The volatility of bitcoin turns the people who own it into addicts. At any given moment, it’s up $100 or down a thousand.

When it’s up, you think you’re brilliant, that you somehow had something to do with it.

Most people don’t day trade bitcoin, but all of us day trade something. We’re hooked into something volatile, easily measured and emotional. We overdo our response to news, good or bad, and let it distract us from the long-term job of living a useful life.

Your SEO results, your Facebook likes, the look on your boss’s face when she gets back from a meeting–all of these things are rife with opportunities for day trading.

It’ll be volatile with or without your help. Better to set it aside and get back to the real work of making a difference instead.
