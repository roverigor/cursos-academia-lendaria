the truth is the causality
the truth is the nucleus of the cell the
truth is
the central source and impetus
from which all the problems at hand
were born that is the truth
by truth i don't mean that someone's
lying or being
you know being untruthful
the same way that by the word sincere i
don't mean that someone is being
deceitful sincere means genuine
at least the way that i'm using it the
truth means
what is the source of the problem
and upon examining the source
if you remove
that central
element upon which the problem rests
then the problem will come tumbling down
every problem every situation every
circumstance
has a truth we may not know what it is
and usually we don't know what it is but
the just the idea that the situation
that i'm facing right now
has an absolute definable and knowable
truth
and upon finding that i will find my way
just that idea allows one
to have a very effective alternative
to the ineffective path
of pursuing prescriptions
