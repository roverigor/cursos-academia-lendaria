turmoil arrives on its own accord and it
must leave by its own accord in what
ways that accomplished there's no way
that I can answer that question there's
no way that I can say let me tell you
it's it's it's it's about it's about
being thrown into the water and then
coming out and becoming wet and then you
and then me asking you what do you feel
right now and then you sing unwed and I
asked you what does wet mean you have no
way to describe that so what am I going
to say do these things are going to be
out of trouble no my discourse is my to
those Scrolls those things are an
ongoing exposure to a human being which
slowly seeps into the bones without any
effort from themselves and without any
but without a shadow of a prescription
so this is not a
um it's not a five-step plan so can you
tell me how to do that turmoil that's
nonsense no uh I will tell you this
turmoil will leave on its own in if
there is the appropriate immersion if
there is the appropriate and systematic
and ongoing and consistent exposure to
true it will leave on its own
so do you think that that that the few
people who are serious about the truth
are we trying too hard to understand the
notion of the truth is why is that why
it's elusive to the majority of us
um no I don't think there's a reason I I
I I would say my first answer would be
nobody really is interested in the truth
and it's not a good thing or a bad thing
I keep coming back it is not a good
thing or a bad thing it is almost it is
virtually impossible to talk to people
and it isn't the people's fault it's the
society's fault it's because they have
to become conditioned to hear what you
didn't say and it's not their fault
because in all cases they're right so
for instance if I say what I just said
if I say
um uh they don't want to hear the truth
they don't hear that what they hear is
they don't want to hear the truth and
they should okay and they're not wrong
to hear that because that's the only
message being propagated their whole
entire life they are surrounded by
loudspeakers in every direction even
from from the underside everything is in
that vein you should be doing this and
anything that's negative any anything
that's in the human negative which says
well because you don't do this the
implication absolutely 100 000 is that
they're saying well you should do this
and I'm not I'm saying things that face
value but human beings are not unable to
see things that face value because they
had been conditioned to be prescribed to
and that's the only microphone through
which they hear agreed a thousand
percent so I you know when you think
about the emotional impact obviously
that it's having on people is real I
want to ask you something about the
economic impact of the economic impact
especially the
