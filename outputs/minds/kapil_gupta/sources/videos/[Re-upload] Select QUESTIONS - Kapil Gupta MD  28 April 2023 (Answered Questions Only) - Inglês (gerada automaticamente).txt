become chasing that thing so
because you have been patient in one of
your videos that
if you are chasing something it moves
away from you but whenever we have a
desire to get something we start working
and
sometimes it becomes a chasing so how do
we know like uh when we are like chasing
or like uh when do we know that
[Music]
I mean by working
on it let's say like it's making money
or like you have we have a gold and
to reach that goal I'll be doing certain
things
uh at some point sometimes I feel like
it's also becoming a Chase
but is there a way to know exactly no uh
something so I think what
I think I think an important thing to
understand
um
[Music]
is if I
take a moment to respond to a question
and if I ask a question
the question is not
the question is not as rudimentary as it
sounds
so I asked you a question
what is working
and you sort of blew it off
you answered it according to
a second grade examination
of the fact that a question was posed to
you
When anybody else in the world and I do
not mean to be egoistic it just is the
way it is and if it sounds that way so
be
when anyone else in the world asks you a
question they're talking nonsense
because they're not really probing
they're simply asking a top of a head
question like a spinal reflex
if I take a moment to ask a question
it should almost be unanswered
and if you have a response right away
you didn't hear the question
that maybe needs a further
discussion
in this world what what happens is that
when you speak to another human being
you
say blah blah blah
and that blah blah blah incites
a response of blah blah blah
which in turn incites you to say blah
blah blah
and you was everybody listening and
everybody in the world
[Music]
which in turn recites the other person
to produce blah blah blah
so it really isn't too humans speaking
it is blah blah blah speaking to blah
blah blah and if the mouths could be
excised from the body
and the mouths could both be left
hanging in the air mouth to mouth and
the human being in the body of the human
being
to whom those mouths belonged if they
just went home
and left the two mouths four total lips
blah blah blah
that's what you have in the world
that's what exists
therefore when I say something when I
ask a question it doesn't mean that you
should listen
doesn't mean that you should think it's
important it doesn't mean that
you should take notes doesn't mean that
you should even be here
um I don't
have any interest of whether you have
any interest in listening or not
what I will say is that
if I
use any ounce of energy
to ask a question
one thing I can promise you
it is not going to be blah blah blah
and the question may sound
second grade
but that is because everything that you
are used to hearing in your entire life
isn't really speech it's just noise
therefore because you're accustomed to
hearing noise
and you're responding to the noise and
that's how you're 20 and 30 and 60 and
70 years of life have gone then when I
say something you
behave in the exact same manner as if
I'm blah blahing like the rest and I
don't because if I was going to blah
blah I wouldn't have
taken on the question to begin with and
then if I take on the question that's
one thing that's that's one ounce of
energy and then if I happen to ask a
question that's another
level of energy that I'm expending
and so if I have that expenditure
it would be wise to understand if you
have any interest in what I say at all
not that you should
that if I ask a question
it is about 675
000 times deeper than you think what is
being asked and if that same phrase if
that if those same words put in that
same sequence in that same order
was asked by anybody else
then the rapid spinal reflex response
that you provide would be warranted in
my case it is not not because I'm
smarter not because I'm better
but because I don't blah blah
what is missing in this world
is what necessarily must be missing
it has to be missing
because the world is composed
of cosmetics
the world is composed of nothing that is
authentic
genuine or real
therefore the exquisiteness of quality
the carefulness of word choice
the gravity of intention
the Precision
of speech and action
is missing
and when I say that it is missing
it is not a call for revolution
it is not a recommendation that let's
all get together that make it no longer
be missing
rather
it is an observation that will be had by
anyone who has any interest in wisdom
to recognize
not that it's missing and therefore it
must be corrected
but that it's missing and that there's a
reason why it's missing
that it's missing and there's a reason
why it will always be missing
when something is what it is
and it cannot change
then all which comes from that thing
will also be what it is and will not
change the world and the people of the
world
will always be as they are
not devoted to truth
not devoted to
the extraordinary
Heights of quality
not devoted to devotion
their life does not hang on the edge
of the desire to be great
the desire not to waste time
and because that is the nature of the
world
and because that is the nature of the
people of the world
that all of the offshoots
all of the things Downstream
all of the offshoots
all of the things Downstream
can never change
nor should they
because the source
of that which is Downstream will never
change
one may also wish to ask himself why he
is even here
I'm not going to give any tips and
tricks
I'm not going to give a how-to
I'm not going to ask you to improve
I'm not going to give you any five-step
plans
I'm not going to answer the majority of
questions which come
okay
so one may want to ask himself
why they have come here at all
not that they should or should not
yourself why are you here
no lawyer here you may wish to want to
add you they wish to ask yourself the
question
[Music]
human beings have a lot of questions
and rightly so
because life is extremely confusing
dessert
and as a result there is endless
confusion and suffering and misery and
turmoil and strife
in every human life
[Music]
but the way out of those things is never
through the
vehicle of prescription
of method technique hack and how to
those are for very small-minded
single neuron human beings
and small-mindedness and single
neuron-ness
[Music]
is largely a function of conditioning it
isn't a function of innate human
capacity
because the human is
amazing things
it is largely a function of conditioning
of brainwashing
society and this minions and experts
and the entire world of gurus and books
and
media and
on and on
they have created
the human being
let's say they have recreated him
they have created
the person
who babbles and doesn't know whether he
is babbling
and if he doesn't know something he'll
ask how to
and even if he has given a how-to he
won't do it and even if he does it he
won't he won't work
life
demands a serious human being
because life itself is serious
you know one cannot
his life is war
and it's
certainly a war if all you have is a
slingshot
then the war never ends
absolutely exists
but they don't exist
in the framework
in the lens and by way of the vehicle
through which human beings have been
conditioned to proceed
hi computer thanks for taking my
question
how do you remove the conditioning that
gets in the way of uh greatness among
your clients please
your entire life
is filled with beliefs opinions
and prescriptions
that's your entire life
that's everybody's entire life
they have a lot of ideas about things
they have
they think that things are this way and
not that way
they haven't
endless number of beliefs about things
they have a framework and mental models
all this garbage
how can a person
whose psyche is so full
even have the mechanical possibility
of learning anything because any
anything that is true falls in the face
of that which is false
or flies in the face of that which is
false but if someone is convinced of
falseness then he will automatically see
that which is true as being foreign
and
not
truth
thank you for taking my question
um
I'm
certain of one thing in my life and it's
I don't want to waste it
and
in my pursuit of
not wasting it
I read
and I listen to others
and I'm still flat
and I'm wondering
what what is one to do
or
huh
for someone who doesn't want to waste
their life how would another person
think about
or
sorry I'm struggling here to articulate
um question here
um
I have an understanding that life is
very precious precious it's very
temporary
over at the same time
to business that I'm in and the work
that I do
although it's useful
it isn't Pleasant
um
have this experience
um
and it's and I'm not like I'm not
looking for an answer here I'm just
wondering why
why the mechanism is is this way right
like you know
understanding and emotions and
I'm just trying to understand
why the feeling and what is what what
needs to be done
are sort of
counter-intuitive if that makes sense
like if it needs to be done it should be
you should feel good right
um
but my experience
I don't know if I'm in it according to
you you don't want to waste life and
therefore your remedy for that is
to read and listen to others
what does that mean
it means that
I don't have a solution for
for the problems that needs to be solved
and so I
and so I asked others for advice
um
and even when I listen to their advice
my my spinal reaction is just like I I
don't even
it's wrong you know uh I I I won't do it
um
and so my question is around like
why am I in so the question but you know
you have to look at things you have to
look at things reasonably
if you have the you know are you in
search of it
solution to a problem when you have a
question about something
[Music]
whatever it is
and if you and I mean this things that
are non-mechanical that's right
um if you read a book or if you ask a
person
to find the answers to you to your
questions
the book that you read
and the person that you ask
for it to have any possibility
of helping you in any consistent way is
that correct
thank you for taking my question I am a
I own that are really going to change my
industry
but now that I've done that I worry that
first principles are along the lines of
prescriptions that
I've created
uh so I've been I've been living on my
own for over a decade and it's been good
and I have always done what you know
what I've wanted to do so to speak
um
uh just over the years though I've been
getting more and more pressure from
family
to kind of abide by certain Traditions
or Customs etc etc and I've never it's
just it's just I've never felt
compatible with those things I've never
abided by them
and the pressures become harder or
stronger and stronger
uh and
my question to you is
um
uh it seems I've been investigating this
feeling for a while and it seems like
I'm struggling to give myself permission
and it seems like I'm kind of looking to
someone else or somewhere else to give
to get permission to do what I want to
do even though I've been doing it it's
just I guess I've been guilty conscious
almost
um and so my question to you is I guess
like what am I not understanding
about giving myself permission in this
case
well it's too narrow of a question and
the context is not
uh
I don't know enough about the context to
answer that question but one thing I
will say from a foundational perspective
is that when there is
when there was Clash
when there is
um
the first things that often goes
is
matter one's manner of speaking
and
obvious and obvious demonstration of
respect
and
regardless of the detail of any question
if those if that is
held strongly to
as a foundational element
problems either go away
or they certainly
limit the bleeding
and they
uh I could appeal thank you so much for
your work
um
I find uh nowadays that a lot of my life
feels like gambling in a sense
um
even with anything professional or
personal because there's not really a
spot where
anyone can land on pure truth having or
me personally being exposed to so much
non-truth in my life which I realize um
I find that I just start making kind of
statistical ideas of how like modeling
how the chances of my life are going to
go forward whether that's like a thought
or a
an action or whatever not
trusting other people and trusting
myself still feels like gambling in the
same sense do you have any perspective
on that
well why wouldn't it be gambling
I guess because the results are the same
with myself and other people at the same
time if that makes sense sure why
wouldn't it be why wouldn't it be
gangling whether it's you your neighbor
or a frog why wouldn't it be gambling
um
I guess because the opposite of gambling
is having some sort of assured idea of
what is happening and there's an assured
sense of where it's going I guess
um yeah man that sounds like truth
right it feels just as unsure as the
gambling part
um so if you don't know the truth
but why isn't it gambling it's not even
gambling it's it's a almost it's a
virtual guaranteed loss at least
gambling you know you can roll the
asking for advice
or even a uh
from any source
which does not
no truth
have truth or is devoted to truth
isn't just gambling fair to say that
trying to search for a someone who does
have the truth is also gambling in a
sense as well I guess again I'm not
trying to search for a resolution here I
guess
I I if you're trying to search for
someone who has the truth
um
I don't know what else I don't know what
else you could do whether that person is
yourself or somebody else I don't know
what else you could do I mean I don't uh
that that would not that would not be
unwise
because if you found that person
um then you will have found a source
that
can benefit you for the rest of your
life
hi there
um
my question is around
emotion
and there seems to be a gap between the
most
yeah
and
my Reptilian Brain
can't help but
action towards my emotions
is is the human
is the human the human can't help it
right so who told who told where did you
read about quote Reptilian Brain
no I
something in my college
it's like it's
um it's just like automatic reflex
that's what I'm trying to communicate
but
um
there the you know like
there's me there seems to be something
about it that I don't quite
fully understand
and I'm wondering if like What's
blocking me is is me trying to explain
it and I want to know like why why why
is it like that you know and I don't
know if you feel it sounds like it
sounds like you're you're a scientist I
don't know I I work in finance now but
well it sounds like you have a
scientific
um
bent it sounds like you have a academic
uh
view about things it sounds like you
uh have an analytical it's true
black and white
mathematical biological
uh type of
predisposition yeah that's true and
those who have that
um
really will have
I mean everybody has a difficult time
with truth but
the people who have that type of
predisposition and intellectuals and so
forth they're virtually
um
fight of Truth forever
yeah that's my feeling because because
truth does not fit into a test tube and
Truth cannot be taught according to
principles and
um
and Analysis and Truth is something
which lives
between the hard lines of Science and
Mathematics
and therefore it demands that a person
either altered himself
of the Richard or that a person has
the type of predisposition
which allows him to enter
almost liquid milieu as opposed to
um that which is made of brick and
mortar
reading your work
have found that I'm very
fearful of
the
the common
people The psychosis that pervades lots
of things
popular delusions I'm fearful of the
consequences of that I have panic
attacks
where
it seems to me like
Humanity will overcome me
um
there's nothing I can do I live in a
city
and I often fear collapse
I have elderly parents who
I would
not like to see suffer
and
my question is I feel like
I cannot exist in
I'm I don't want to fear people and I
don't want to exist in a state of fear
and I'm wondering what it is that allows
someone
to
to pursue the truth and not
be terrified
by what that may lead well the question
is that the fear is a very big question
and it cannot be answered in this kind
of
um format but
um
but what I will say that it isn't about
society and it isn't about other people
well the issue is the world is a sewer
always will be it's a snake bit always
will be so the person that worries about
sewers and snake bits
um that's not going to go anywhere so
that's what I can tell you it's never in
the world foreign
