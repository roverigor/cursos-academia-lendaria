## Personal Life

### Family
- **Married**: Sonya Rosenwald Kurzweil (since 1975)
- **Marriage Duration**: 49+ years (ongoing)
- **Children**:
  - **Ethan Kurzweil**: Venture capitalist
  - **Amy Kurzweil**: Cartoonist and author

### Personal Loss (Formative Trauma)
- **Father's Death**: Father died when Ray was **22 years old** (1970)
- **Impact**: Drove obsession with life extension and defeating death
- **Response**: Resurrection project (AI simulation of father from artifacts)

**Psychological Note**: Father's death at critical age (22, just after MIT graduation) appears to be origin trauma for longevity obsession. Taking 200+ supplements daily and predicting life extension timeline directly traceable to this loss.

## Philosophical Views and Advocacy

### Transhumanism and Life Extension
- Active advocate for human enhancement via technology
- Believes technology will enable indefinite lifespan
- Personal commitment: Extreme supplement protocol

### Technological Singularity
- Predicts 2045 as inflection point
- Human-AI merger via brain-computer interfaces
- Exponential acceleration continues beyond

### Economic Views
- **Supports**: Universal Basic Income (UBI)
- **Reasoning**: AI will displace jobs, require new economic model
- **Timeline**: UBI necessary by 2030s

### Religious/Spiritual Views
- **Religious stance**: Agnostic
- **Soul question**: Agnostic about existence of soul
- **Consciousness**: Functionalist view (patterns = consciousness)
- **Language**: Uses spiritual terminology despite materialist framework

**Paradox**: Secular Jewish background, agnostic beliefs, but uses "spiritual machines" language. Bridges rationalism with meaning-making.
