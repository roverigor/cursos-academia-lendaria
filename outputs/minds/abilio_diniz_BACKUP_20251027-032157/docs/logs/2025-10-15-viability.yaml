          pneumonia (not lifestyle disease). 75 years of relentless physical
          discipline. Pioneered employee gyms in Brazil (1980s). Embodied
          "physical fitness = life philosophy."
        hook: "Boxing at 12, triathlon at 80, teaching until 87."

      notes: |
        All three stories are EXCEPTIONAL. Kidnapping is dramatic, traumatic,
        and transformative. Bankruptcy-to-billionaire is classic underdog.
        75-year fitness obsession is inspiring and unique. High memetic potential.

    overall_x_factor_notes: |
      **EXCEPTIONAL X-FACTOR**. Trauma-to-transformation narrative is rare and
      powerful. 6-day underground kidnapping with PTSD → Brazil's leading
      resilience teacher is remarkable. 75-year fitness obsession (boxing at 12,
      triathlon at 80) is extraordinary. Multiple reinventions without retirement
      (worked age 12-87) shows relentless growth mindset.

      **MEMORABLE STORIES**: Kidnapping, bankruptcy-to-billionaire, lifelong
      fitness. High memetic and teaching potential.

      **LIMITATION**: Cultural zeitgeist primarily Brazilian/Latin American.
      Passed away Feb 2024 (not currently trending globally).

      notes: |
        Themes are highly timeless (leadership, resilience, wellness). Recent
        passing (Feb 2024) adds timely memorial interest. Resilience and
        longevity are peak relevance (post-pandemic, aging population).
        Low decay risk - 70 years of validation means methods aren't fads.

      notes: |
        Moderately forward-looking. Wellness, longevity, resilience, ESG are
        growing fields. However, not cutting-edge tech (no AI, biotech). Retail

            Less step-by-step than Leadership 360°.

      practical_application:

        - "Personal routines documented (boxing, running, discipline)"
        - "Business case studies from 70 years experience"

      notes: |
        Very actionable. Leadership 360° and 6 Pillars provide clear,
        implementable frameworks. FGV course proves structured applicability.
        Personal routines (fitness, discipline) are concrete and replicable.
        Slight deduction: Some elements (3 Breaking Points) more conceptual.

        Moderate breadth across business functions (operations, finance, strategy).
        Limited breadth outside Brazil and traditional industries. Not a polymath

        execution (700+ stores, $860M sale, $3.7B AUM, thousands trained).
        75 years of continuous work shows relentless implementation discipline.

final_recommendation:
  decision: "GO - PRIORITY TIER 1"
  confidence: "VERY HIGH (89/100 APEX, 91.5% ICP)"

  priority_tier: 1
  rationale: |
    **TIER 1: EXCEPTIONAL VIABILITY**

    Abilio Diniz scores 89/100 APEX (Very High) and 91.5% ICP match.
    National icon status, 70 years expertise, proven teaching frameworks,
    exceptional X-factor (trauma-to-transformation, 75-year fitness obsession),
    and massive market opportunity (Brazil/Latin America).

    **Why Tier 1**:
    - World-class expertise (19/20): 70 years, built national champion
    - Exceptional X-factor (14/15): Kidnapping survival, bankruptcy-to-billionaire
    - Strong public persona (14/15): National icon, authentic vulnerability
    - Proven teaching (FGV professor, Leadership 360°, 220K+ books)
    - Massive market (215M Brazil, 265M Portuguese speakers)
    - High ICP match (91.5%): Leadership, resilience, wellness, retail

    **Slight Limitations**:
    - Portuguese-language barrier (limits international reach)
    - Deceased (no new primary content after Feb 2024)
    - Moderate breadth (deep but not polymath like Kurzweil)
    - Not cutting-edge tech (retail, not AI/biotech)

    **But**: Brazilian market alone justifies Tier 1. Themes are timeless and
    highly relevant (resilience, longevity, leadership). 70 years of validation
    means low risk. Proven frameworks (Leadership 360°) de-risk implementation.
