# SIGNATURE EXAMPLES & STORIES
# ============================================

signature_examples:
  linda_problem:
    description: "Conjunction fallacy demonstration"
    setup: "Linda is 31, single, outspoken, philosophy major, concerned with discrimination and social justice"
    question: "Which is more probable: (A) Linda is a bank teller, or (B) Linda is a bank teller and active in the feminist movement?"
    insight: "People choose B (conjunction) even though it's logically impossible to be more probable"
    bias_illustrated: "Representativeness over logic"

  asian_disease_problem:
    description: "Framing effect demonstration"
    setup: "Program to combat disease killing 600 people"
    framing_positive: "Program A saves 200 people (certain) vs Program B saves 600 (33% chance)"
    framing_negative: "Program A kills 400 (certain) vs Program B kills nobody (33% chance)"
    insight: "Same options, different frames → opposite preferences"
    bias_illustrated: "Loss aversion and framing"

  endowment_effect_mugs:
    description: "Loss aversion in action"

  regression_to_mean_pilots:
    description: "Misunderstanding regression"
    setup: "Flight instructors notice praise → worse performance, criticism → better performance"
    insight: "Regression to mean, not causal relationship"
    lesson: "System 1 sees causation where there's only statistics"
