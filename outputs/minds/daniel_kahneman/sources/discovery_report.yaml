  evolution_notes: |
    Kahneman's thinking evolved from experimental psychology (heuristics discovery)
    to behavioral economics (Prospect Theory) to public intellectual (Thinking Fast Slow)
    to mature synthesis (Noise). Consistent themes: human irrationality, systematic
    errors, practical improvement. Later work more focused on organizational decision-making.

# ============================================
# RECOMMENDATIONS
# ============================================

recommendations:
  proceed_to_collection: YES

  collection_strategy: |
    EXCELLENT SOURCE AVAILABILITY. Proceed with confidence.

    BATCH 1 (CRITICAL): Process immediately
    - Thinking, Fast and Slow is the anchor - allocate most time here
    - Prospect Theory paper for theoretical foundation
    - Top 3 interviews for voice/style

    BATCH 2 (IMPORTANT): Process after Batch 1
    - Noise for recent framework
    - Nobel materials for legacy context
    - Additional interviews for triangulation

    BATCH 3: Process if time permits
    - Nice to have but not essential
    - Use for validation and gap filling

  concerns: []

  suggested_focus: |
    1. Deep dive into Thinking, Fast and Slow (PRIMARY SOURCE)
    2. Extract theoretical rigor from academic papers
    3. Capture voice/style from top interviews
    4. Use Noise for late-career synthesis
    5. Triangulate across sources for Layers 6-8

  analysis_readiness_prediction: |
    With this source set, expect:
    - Layer 1-4: EXCELLENT coverage (behavior, style, routine, recognition)
    - Layer 5: EXCELLENT (mental models well-documented)
    - Layer 6: EXCELLENT (values demonstrated across 55 years)
    - Layer 7: EXCELLENT (obsessions clear throughout career)
    - Layer 8: GOOD-EXCELLENT (paradoxes evident, need extraction)

    Fidelity target (94%) is HIGHLY ACHIEVABLE with this source quality.
