model_1_dual_process_cognition:
  name: "System 1 / System 2 Thinking"
  description: "Two fundamentally different modes of thought"

  system_1:
    characteristics:
      - "Fast, automatic, intuitive"
      - "Operates effortlessly, no sense of voluntary control"
      - "Associative, pattern-matching"
      - "Generates impressions, feelings, inclinations"
      - "Prone to systematic biases"
    function: "Quick judgments, survival responses, learned expertise"
    strength: "Efficient, saves cognitive resources"
    weakness: "Systematic biases, overconfidence"

  system_2:
    characteristics:
      - "Slow, deliberate, analytical"
      - "Requires effort and attention"
      - "Logical, rule-based, conscious"
      - "Can override System 1 (when motivated)"
      - "Lazy - tends to accept System 1 suggestions"
    function: "Complex calculations, conscious decisions, novel problems"
    strength: "Can catch errors, logical reasoning"
    weakness: "Effortful, limited capacity, often lazy"

  interaction:
    normal_state: "System 2 monitors System 1, intervenes when stakes high"
    problem: "System 2 is lazy, often rubber-stamps System 1"
    implication: "Biases persist even when we 'know better'"

  applications:
    - "Decision-making: when to trust intuition vs analyze"
    - "Expertise: System 1 can be trained (chess, medicine)"
    - "Debiasing: engage System 2 when System 1 unreliable"

model_2_prospect_theory:
  name: "Prospect Theory - Decision Under Risk"
  description: "How people actually make decisions (vs economic rationality)"

  core_principles:
    reference_dependence:
      concept: "Evaluate outcomes as gains/losses from reference point, not absolute states"
      implication: "Same outcome feels different based on framing"

    loss_aversion:
      concept: "Losses loom larger than equivalent gains (2:1 ratio)"
      formula: "Pain of losing $100 > pleasure of gaining $100"
      implication: "Risk averse for gains, risk seeking for losses"

    diminishing_sensitivity:
      concept: "Marginal value decreases as move from reference point"
      example: "$100→$200 feels bigger than $1000→$1100"

    probability_weighting:
      concept: "Overweight small probabilities, underweight moderate/high"
      example: "Lottery tickets (overweight 0.001%), insurance (overweight rare disasters)"

  value_function:
    shape: "S-curve, steeper for losses than gains"
    properties:
      - "Defined on gains and losses (not total wealth)"
      - "Concave for gains (risk averse)"
      - "Convex for losses (risk seeking)"
      - "Steeper for losses (loss aversion)"

  applications:
    - "Investment decisions (sell winners, hold losers - wrong)"
    - "Negotiation (framing as gains vs losses)"
    - "Policy design (default effects)"
    - "Marketing (emphasize what customer loses by not buying)"

model_3_heuristics_as_biases:
  name: "Heuristics and Biases Framework"
  description: "Mental shortcuts that systematically err"

  representativeness:
    mechanism: "Judge probability by similarity to stereotypes"
    bias_produced: "Base rate neglect, conjunction fallacy"
    example: "Linda seems like feminist → ignore that bank tellers more common"

  availability:
    mechanism: "Judge frequency by ease of recall"
    bias_produced: "Overestimate vivid/recent events"
    example: "Recent plane crash → overestimate flight risk"

  anchoring:
    mechanism: "Insufficient adjustment from initial value"
    bias_produced: "First number influences judgment"
    example: "Wheel of fortune 10 vs 65 → affects African nations estimate"

  substitution:
    mechanism: "Answer easier question than one asked"
    bias_produced: "Affect heuristic, availability substitution"
    example: "How happy? → How is my mood right now?"

  wysiati:
    mechanism: "What You See Is All There Is - ignore missing information"
    bias_produced: "Overconfidence, coherent stories from thin data"
    implication: "Don't notice what we don't know"

  meta_principle: "Heuristics are adaptive shortcuts that produce systematic biases"

  source: "Heuristics and Biases papers (1970s), Thinking Fast Slow Part 2"

model_4_two_selves:
  name: "Experiencing Self vs Remembering Self"
  description: "Two selves with different interests and measures of well-being"

  experiencing_self:
    focus: "Moment-to-moment experience"
    question: "Does it hurt now?"
    measure: "Time-integrated happiness (sum of moments)"
    priority: "Minimize pain, maximize pleasure in present"

  remembering_self:
    focus: "Stories and memories"
    question: "How was it overall?"
    measure: "Peak-end rule (peak moment + end moment)"
    priority: "Good stories, memorable experiences"

  conflict:
    duration_neglect: "Remembering self ignores duration"
    example: "Colonoscopy - add painless minute at end → better memory, worse for experiencing self"
    implication: "We make decisions for remembering self that hurt experiencing self"

  applications:
    - "Vacation planning (memorable moments vs daily experience)"
    - "Medical decisions (painful procedure with good end)"
    - "Life choices (career that makes good story vs daily happiness)"

model_5_noise_vs_bias:
  name: "Noise Framework - Unwanted Variability"
  description: "Distinguish systematic error (bias) from random variability (noise)"

  bias:
    definition: "Systematic deviation in one direction"
    example: "All judges too harsh (bias toward severity)"
    detectability: "Easier to detect (pattern visible)"

  noise:
    definition: "Unwanted variability in judgments that should be identical"
    example: "Judge gives different sentences for same crime on different days"
    detectability: "Harder to detect (seems like valid disagreement)"

  types_of_noise:
    level_noise: "Some judges harsher overall"
    pattern_noise: "Judges disagree on which cases deserve severity"
    occasion_noise: "Same judge varies day to day"

  implications:
    - "Organizations have more noise than they think"
    - "Noise audits reveal hidden variability"
    - "Decision hygiene reduces noise"

  debiasing_vs_denoising:
    bias: "Find directional error, correct"
    noise: "Reduce variability, standardize"

# SECONDARY MENTAL MODELS
# ============================================

supporting_models:

  regression_to_mean:
    concept: "Extreme performance followed by average (statistical, not causal)"
    application: "Don't attribute regression to causal factors"
    example: "Best performance → reward → worse next time (not because of reward)"

  outside_view:
    concept: "Use reference class, not inside case details"
    application: "Planning, forecasting"
    example: "How long do similar projects take? (not 'this one is special')"

  pre_mortem:
    concept: "Imagine project failed, explain why"
    application: "Debiasing technique for planning"
    advantage: "Legitimizes dissent, surfaces risks"

  algorithms_beat_humans:
    concept: "Simple formulas outperform expert judgment"
    application: "High-stakes decisions (medical, legal, hiring)"
    resistance: "People don't trust algorithms (prefer human fallibility)"

  scope_insensitivity:
    concept: "Emotional response doesn't scale with magnitude"
    example: "2000 vs 20000 birds in oil spill - similar outrage"
    implication: "System 1 doesn't do scope"

# ============================================
# META-MODEL: HOW KAHNEMAN THINKS
