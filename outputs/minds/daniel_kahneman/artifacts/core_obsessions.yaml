# ============================================
# CORE OBSESSIONS (Driving Questions)
# ============================================

obsession_1_why_systematic_errors:
  question: "Why do humans make predictable, systematic errors in judgment?"
  manifestation: "Entire career devoted to cataloging and explaining cognitive biases"

  evidence:
    - "50+ years studying heuristics and biases"
    - "Thinking Fast Slow: comprehensive bias catalog"
    - "Nobel Prize specifically for 'judgment under uncertainty'"
    - "Every paper, talk, book returns to this question"

  what_drives_this:
    - "Fascination with irrationality (we think we're logical, but aren't)"
    - "Pattern recognition - seeing same errors across contexts"
    - "Desire to map the terrain of human fallibility"

  evolution:
    - "1970s: Discovery phase (heuristics identification)"
    - "1980s-1990s: Theory phase (Prospect Theory explains why)"
    - "2000s-2010s: Synthesis phase (System 1/2 framework)"
    - "2020s: Expansion phase (Noise adds variability dimension)"

obsession_2_when_trust_intuition:
  question: "When can we trust our intuitions, and when should we override them?"
  manifestation: "Constant exploration of intuition's reliability boundaries"

  evidence:
    - "Thinking Fast Slow Chapter 22: 'Expert Intuition: When Can We Trust It?'"
    - "Knowledge Project interview: 'Putting Your Intuition on Ice'"
    - "Research on clinical vs statistical prediction"
    - "Pre-mortem technique explicitly designed to counter intuition"

  nuance:
    - "Not anti-intuition (recognizes expertise value)"
    - "Not pro-intuition (sees systematic failures)"
    - "Obsessed with BOUNDARIES: when it works vs fails"

  criteria_discovered:
    valid_intuition_requires:
      - "Stable, predictable environment"
      - "Opportunity for prolonged practice"
      - "Rapid, unambiguous feedback"
    invalid_when:
      - "Low predictability (stock market)"
      - "Delayed feedback (long-term outcomes)"
      - "Novel situations (no pattern base)"

obsession_3_how_improve_decisions:
  question: "How can we actually improve human judgment and decision-making?"
  manifestation: "From diagnosis to prescription - practical debiasing"

  evidence:
    - "Pre-mortem technique (actionable tool)"
    - "Outside view / reference class forecasting"
    - "Decision hygiene (Noise book)"
    - "Algorithms vs clinical judgment research"
    - "Thinking Fast Slow: many 'Speaking Points' are actionable"

  progression:
    - "Early: Identify biases (diagnosis)"
    - "Middle: Explain mechanisms (understanding)"
    - "Late: Provide tools (intervention)"

  realism:
    - "Knows that awareness ≠ immunity"
    - "'Organizations are better than individuals' (systems over willpower)"
    - "Advocates for choice architecture, not just education"

obsession_4_experiencing_vs_remembering:
  question: "Why do our experiencing and remembering selves want different things?"
  manifestation: "Deep exploration of well-being paradox"

  evidence:
    - "TED Talk 2010: 'The Riddle of Experience vs Memory'"
    - "Thinking Fast Slow Part 5: 'Two Selves'"
    - "Well-Being book (1999)"
    - "Peak-end rule research"

  paradox_explored:
    - "We make decisions for remembering self"
    - "But we live as experiencing self"
    - "These selves have conflicting interests"
    - "Duration neglect: remembering self ignores time"

  implications:
    - "How should we measure happiness?"
    - "Which self should policy optimize for?"
    - "Colonoscopy example: add painless minute (better memory, worse experience)"

obsession_5_noise_vs_bias:
  question: "Why is unwanted variability (noise) so overlooked compared to bias?"
  manifestation: "Late-career focus on noise as distinct from bias"

  evidence:
    - "Noise (2021) - entire book on this question"
    - "Conversations with Tyler: 'Cutting Through the Noise' (2018 preview)"
    - "Noise audits in organizations"

  insight:
    - "Bias gets attention (systematic, visible pattern)"
    - "Noise is invisible (seems like valid disagreement)"
    - "Yet noise often larger problem in organizations"

  examples:
    - "Judges: same crime, vastly different sentences (noise)"
    - "Doctors: same symptoms, different diagnoses (noise)"
    - "Forecasters: same data, divergent predictions (noise)"

  solution_obsession:
    - "How to measure noise (noise audits)"
    - "How to reduce noise (decision hygiene)"
    - "Why organizations resist acknowledging it"

# ============================================
# META-OBSESSION
# ============================================

meta_pattern:
  overarching_theme: "How can we see clearly what our minds hide from us?"

  unity:
    - "All obsessions relate to human blindness to own limitations"
    - "Systematic errors (obsession 1) hide from us"
    - "Intuition reliability (obsession 2) unclear to intuition itself"
    - "Improvement hard (obsession 3) because biases resist correction"
    - "Two selves (obsession 4) - we don't notice the split"
    - "Noise invisible (obsession 5) - variability seems like validity"

  kahneman_sees_pattern: "We are blind to our blindness"

# ============================================
# TEMPORAL EVOLUTION
# ============================================

career_arc:
  1960s_early:
    obsession: "How do people form judgments?"
    focus: "Pure cognitive psychology"

  1970s_foundational:
    obsession: "Why systematic errors?" (emerges)
    breakthrough: "Heuristics and biases discovery"

  1980s_theoretical:
    obsession: "Why loss aversion?" / "How do we decide under risk?"
    breakthrough: "Prospect Theory (1979, refined 1980s)"

  1990s_integration:
    obsession: "When trust intuition?" / "How integrate psychology + economics?"
    development: "Behavioral economics established"

  2000s_synthesis:
    obsession: "Experiencing vs remembering?" / "How explain to public?"
    output: "Thinking Fast Slow (2011)"

    obsession: "What about noise?" / "Organizational improvement?"
    output: "Noise (2021)"

  pattern: "Each obsession builds on previous, expands scope"
