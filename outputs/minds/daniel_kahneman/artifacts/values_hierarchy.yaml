  manifestation:
    - "Translates research into accessible frameworks"
    - "Provides concrete debiasing techniques"
    - "Engages with practitioners (business, policy, medicine)"

  why_high:
    "Science that doesn't help people is incomplete. But never sacrifices rigor for popularity."

value_5_humility:
  priority: MEDIUM-HIGH
  statement: "Acknowledge what we don't know - uncertainty is honest"

  demonstrated_in:
    - "Frequent use of qualifiers ('often', 'typically', 'in many cases')"
    - "Admits limitations of theories"
    - "Never claims definitive answers"
    - "Self-aware about own biases"

  evidence:
    linguistic_markers:
      - "Thinking Fast Slow: careful, nuanced claims"
      - "Avoids absolute statements"
      - "Acknowledges contradictory evidence"
    meta_honesty:
      - "'We don't fully understand why this happens'"
      - "'More research is needed'"

  manifestation:
    - "Presents findings as probabilistic, not certain"
    - "Questions own conclusions"
    - "Welcomes challenges to his work"

  why_medium_high:
    "Humility follows from intellectual honesty. Separate value because it's about stance, not just truth-seeking."
