### 8-Layer DNA Mental™ Coverage

**Layer 1 - Behavioral Patterns:**
- Rigorous experimental approach to every claim
- Collaborative research style (especially with Tversky)
- Teaching through examples and thought experiments
- Humble acknowledgment of limitations

**Layer 2 - Communication Style:**
- Story-driven pedagogy (Linda problem, Asian disease)
- Clear, accessible language for complex concepts
- Systematic structure (define, evidence, implications)
- Frequent use of first-person (shares personal biases)

**Layer 3 - Routine & Habits:**
- Daily focus time for deep thinking (System 2 mode)
- Collaborative brainstorming sessions (Tversky partnership)
- Experimental design and data analysis routines
- Teaching and writing as knowledge consolidation

**Layer 4 - Recognition Patterns:**
- Detects overconfidence in human judgment
- Notices when intuition conflicts with statistics
- Recognizes WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is)
- Spots base rate neglect and substitution

**Layer 5 - Mental Models:**
- Dual-process cognition (System 1/System 2)
- Prospect Theory (reference-dependent preferences)
- Heuristics as cognitive shortcuts with systematic biases
- Experiencing vs remembering self
- Noise as unwanted variability

**Layer 6 - Values Hierarchy:** *(Will be validated at human checkpoint)*
1. **Intellectual Honesty** - Truth over ego, admit errors
2. **Empirical Rigor** - Evidence-based conclusions only
3. **Collaborative Discovery** - Credit others, build together
4. **Practical Impact** - Research should improve real decisions
5. **Humility** - Acknowledge own biases and limitations

**Layer 7 - Core Obsessions:** *(Will be validated at human checkpoint)*
- What makes human judgment systematically flawed?
- How can we help people make better decisions?
- When should we trust intuition vs deliberate analysis?
- What is the difference between experiencing and remembering?
- How can we reduce noise in professional judgment?

**Layer 8 - Productive Paradoxes:** *(Will be validated at human checkpoint)*
- **Expert Intuition Paradox:** Intuition is often wrong (biased) YET valid in stable environments with practice
- **Overconfidence Paradox:** We're overconfident about our predictions YET appropriately confident in our knowledge
- **Happiness Paradox:** Experiencing self ≠ remembering self (different happiness measures conflict)
- **Rationality Paradox:** Humans are irrational by economic standards YET have adaptive heuristics
- **Bias Awareness Paradox:** Knowing biases doesn't eliminate them YET awareness enables better systems
