    Implements GPS + Didática Lendária pedagogical frameworks with optional MMOS voice integration.
  type: greenfield
  project_types:
    - online-course
    - mini-course

    - workshop
    - training-module

  sequence:
    - agent: course-architect
      creates: course-structure-and-context-detection
      task: init-course-greenfield
      outputs:
        - course_slug

        Initialize greenfield course with INTELLIGENT CONTEXT DETECTION:

        STEP 1: Detect Context
          Check if outputs/courses/{slug}/ exists:
            - If NO → SCENARIO A: Greenfield Pure
            - If YES → Analyze contents:
              * Check COURSE-BRIEF.md completeness
              * Check for /sources/ materials
              * Determine scenario

        STEP 2: Execute Scenario-Appropriate Logic

        SCENARIO A: Greenfield Pure
          - Create folder: outputs/courses/{slug}/
          - Copy COURSE-BRIEF.md template (8 empty sections)
          - Create .metadata.json (context: greenfield_pure)
          - NEXT: User fills COURSE-BRIEF manually

        SCENARIO B: Pre-Created Brief (HYBRID MODE)
          - Validate existing COURSE-BRIEF.md (≥70% complete)
          - Detect /sources/ materials (optional)
          - Update .metadata.json (context: pre_created_brief)
          - SKIP manual filling → Proceed to market research
          - NEXT: Auto-continue to market research

        SCENARIO C: Legacy Materials
          - Detect /sources/ but no COURSE-BRIEF
          - Suggest switching to brownfield mode (*upgrade)
          - HALT: Wait for user decision

        SAVE OUTPUT: Course initialized at outputs/courses/{slug}/

            ✅ Source materials: {count} files in /sources/
            ✅ Mode: Greenfield (pre-created brief)

          🎯 Proceeding automatically to market research
            (Skipping manual filling - brief already complete!)

          System will now:
            1. Run market research (competitive intelligence)
            2. Reformulate COURSE-BRIEF with insights
            3. Present reformulated brief for review

          NO ACTION REQUIRED - Workflow continues automatically

        IF context == "legacy_materials":
          ⚠️ WORKFLOW RECOMMENDATION

          📂 Found {count} files in /sources/ but no COURSE-BRIEF.md

          💡 Recommendation: Switch to brownfield mode
            Command: *upgrade {slug}

          Brownfield mode will:
            - Auto-organize your source files
            - Auto-extract ICP, voice, objectives
            - Generate COURSE-BRIEF from materials
            - Run market research
            - Create optimized curriculum

          Options:
            1. Switch to brownfield: *upgrade {slug}
            2. Continue greenfield: Fill COURSE-BRIEF manually
            3. Cancel workflow

          - Preserve user's initial vision

        STEP 2: Load Research Insights
          - Load market-analysis.md (competitive patterns, pricing)
          - Load content-gaps.md (gap topics, priorities)
          - Load differentiation.md (positioning strategy)

        STEP 3: Reformulate COURSE-BRIEF Sections
          Section 1 (Basic Info):
            - Refine subtitle based on differentiation strategy
            - Adjust duration if market insights suggest different scope

          Section 2 (ICP):
            - Validate ICP against market (are we targeting underserved segment?)
            - Add competitive context ("Unlike competitors who target X, we target Y")

          Section 3 (Content & Pedagogy):
            - ADD gap topics to preliminary outline
            - Refine learning objectives based on market gaps
            - Highlight unique pedagogical approach (from differentiation.md)

          Section 4 (Voice & Personality):
            - Reinforce voice differentiation (if competitors are formal, emphasize casual)
            - Add signature style elements that competitors lack

          Section 5 (Format & Delivery):
            - Adjust format based on competitive analysis
            - If all competitors are lecture-heavy, emphasize hands-on approach

          Section 6 (Commercial):
            - Update pricing strategy based on market-analysis.md
            - Refine positioning statement from differentiation.md

          Section 7 (Success Metrics):
            - Add differentiation KPIs (e.g., "85% students say more practical than other courses")

          Section 8 (Constraints):
            - Note any competitive advantages to preserve

        STEP 4: Add Research Summary Section
          - Append new section to COURSE-BRIEF:

          ## 9. Market Research Summary (Auto-Generated)

          **Research Date:** {date}

        Generate all lessons and assessments (8-step workflow):

        STEP 1: Validate course exists
        STEP 2: Load COURSE-BRIEF.md (65 fields from 8 sections)
        STEP 3: Load curriculum.yaml
        STEP 4: Curriculum approval checkpoint (already passed)

        STEP 5: Generate All Lessons (GPS + Didática Lendária)
          For each lesson in curriculum:
            - Build lesson spec (ID, objectives, duration, Bloom's level)
            - Generate content with AI:
              * IF mmos_persona enabled: Load system prompt, inject voice
              * ELSE: Use generic pedagogical template
            - Validate GPS structure (Goal → Position → Steps, score ≥ 30)
            - Validate Didática Lendária (7 elements, score ≥ 70)
            - Retry up to 3x if validation fails
            - Save lesson to outputs/courses/{slug}/lessons/{lesson_id}.md
            - Update checkpoint (for --resume support)

        STEP 6: Validate Course Quality
          - GPS validation (all lessons)
          - DL validation (all lessons)
          - Voice fidelity (if MMOS enabled) [MVP: stub]
          - Bloom's progression check
          - Duration accuracy check

        STEP 7: Generate Assessments
          - Quiz scaffolds per module (YAML with [EDIT ME] placeholders)
          - Final project template (production-ready markdown)

        STEP 8: Cleanup & Summary
          - Display generation stats (lessons, time, cost)
          - Display validation results
          - Remove .state/ folder (checkpoints)

        RESUME SUPPORT:
          If interrupted (CTRL+C):
            - Progress saved to .state/lesson-generation.json
            - Resume with: *generate-lessons {slug} --resume

  decision_guidance:
    when_to_use:
      - Creating courses from scratch (no existing materials)
      - Need structured pedagogical frameworks (GPS + DL)
      - Want consistent instructor voice (MMOS integration)
      - Require quality validation (GPS/DL scoring)
      - Building production-ready courses for students

    when_not_to_use:
      - Upgrading existing course materials (use brownfield-course)
      - Quick informal training (overkill for simple needs)
      - No pedagogical framework requirements
