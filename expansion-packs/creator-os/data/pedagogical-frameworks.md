# Pedagogical Frameworks Knowledge Base

**Purpose:** Reference guide for instructional design frameworks used in course creation and educational content.

## Core Pedagogical Frameworks

### 1. Bloom's Taxonomy (Revised)

**Purpose:** Classify learning objectives by cognitive complexity

**6 Levels (Low to High):**

**Level 1 - Remember:**
- Verbs: define, list, recall, recognize, retrieve
- Example: "List the 5 components of GPS Framework"

**Level 2 - Understand:**
- Verbs: describe, explain, interpret, summarize, classify
- Example: "Explain why Goal comes before Steps in GPS"

**Level 3 - Apply:**
- Verbs: execute, implement, solve, use, demonstrate
- Example: "Create a lesson using GPS Framework"

**Level 4 - Analyze:**
- Verbs: compare, contrast, differentiate, examine, organize
- Example: "Compare GPS vs traditional lesson structures"

**Level 5 - Evaluate:**
- Verbs: critique, judge, assess, justify, defend
- Example: "Evaluate a lesson's compliance with GPS"

**Level 6 - Create:**
- Verbs: design, construct, develop, formulate, produce
- Example: "Design a complete course using GPS + Didática Lendária"

**Usage in CreatorOS:**
- Use for writing learning objectives
- Progress from lower to higher levels within course
- Aim for Level 3+ (Apply) minimum in professional courses

### 2. ADDIE Model

**Purpose:** Systematic instructional design process

**5 Phases:**

**Analysis:**
- Identify learning needs
- Analyze learner characteristics (ICP)
- Define learning objectives
- Assess constraints (time, budget, resources)

**Design:**
- Create course outline
- Select instructional strategies
- Design assessments
- Plan learning activities

**Development:**
- Create content
- Develop materials
- Build assessments
- Produce media

**Implementation:**
- Deliver course
- Facilitate learning
- Provide support

**Evaluation:**
- Assess effectiveness (Kirkpatrick model)
- Collect feedback
- Iterate and improve

**Usage in CreatorOS:**
- Greenfield courses follow full ADDIE
- Brownfield courses emphasize Analysis (extract ICP, objectives)

### 3. Backward Design (Wiggins & McTighe)

**Purpose:** Design courses starting from desired outcomes

**3 Stages:**

**Stage 1 - Identify Desired Results:**
- What should students know/do?
- What enduring understandings?
- What essential questions?

**Stage 2 - Determine Acceptable Evidence:**
- How will we know they learned?
- What assessments demonstrate mastery?
- What rubrics define success?

**Stage 3 - Plan Learning Experiences:**
- What activities lead to outcomes?
- What sequence optimizes learning?
- What resources are needed?

**Usage in CreatorOS:**
- Start with COURSE-BRIEF (outcomes first)
- Design assessments before lessons
- Generate lessons that build toward assessments

---

### 4. Constructivism (Piaget, Vygotsky)

**Core Principles:**
- Learners construct knowledge actively (not passively receive)
- Prior knowledge is foundation
- Social interaction enhances learning
- Context matters

**Implications for Course Design:**
- Use active learning (not just lecture)
- Connect new concepts to existing knowledge
- Provide opportunities for practice/application
- Create collaborative activities
- Use authentic scenarios

**Usage in CreatorOS:**
- GPS Framework: Position (acknowledge prior knowledge)
- Practice exercises in every lesson
- Real-world scenarios over toy examples

---

### 5. Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller)

**Core Concept:** Working memory is limited, must manage cognitive load

**3 Types of Load:**

**Intrinsic Load:**
- Inherent difficulty of material
- Cannot be reduced without simplifying content

**Extraneous Load:**
- Poor instruction design
- Can and should be minimized

**Germane Load:**
- Mental effort for learning/schema construction
- Should be maximized

**Techniques to Manage Load:**
- Chunking (break into digestible pieces)
- Worked examples (before practice)
- Progressive disclosure (don't show everything at once)
- Eliminate redundancy
- Use dual coding (text + visual)

**Usage in CreatorOS:**
- Didática Lendária Principle 3: Max 2-3 concepts per lesson
- Use analogies to reduce intrinsic load
- GPS Framework manages extraneous load (clear structure)

---

### 6. Microlearning

**Purpose:** Deliver learning in small, focused units

**Characteristics:**
- 3-10 minutes per unit
- Single learning objective
- Immediately applicable
- Mobile-friendly
- On-demand access

**Best For:**
- Skill updates
- Just-in-time learning
- Busy professionals
- Mobile contexts

**Usage in CreatorOS:**
- Break long courses into micro-lessons
- Each lesson = 1 concept (Didática Lendária)
- 10-15 min video lessons max

---

### 7. Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle

**Purpose:** Learning through experience and reflection

**4 Stages:**

**1. Concrete Experience:**
- Do something (activity, exercise, simulation)

**2. Reflective Observation:**
- Reflect on experience
- What happened? What did I notice?

**3. Abstract Conceptualization:**
- Form concepts based on reflection
- What does this mean? What principle?

**4. Active Experimentation:**
- Apply concepts to new situations
- Test in real world

**Usage in CreatorOS:**
- GPS "Steps" include practice (Concrete Experience)
- Reflective questions after practice (Reflective Observation)
- Concept explanation (Abstract Conceptualization)
- Next lesson builds on previous (Active Experimentation)

---

### 8. Kirkpatrick's Four Levels of Evaluation

**Purpose:** Assess training effectiveness

**Level 1 - Reaction:**
- Did they like it?
- Survey at course end

**Level 2 - Learning:**
- Did they learn?
- Assessments, quizzes

**Level 3 - Behavior:**
- Did they apply it?
- Follow-up 3-6 months later

**Level 4 - Results:**
- Did it impact business?
- ROI, performance metrics

**Usage in CreatorOS:**
- Track completion rates (Level 1)
- Validate with quizzes (Level 2)
- Request testimonials (Level 3)
- Case studies (Level 4)

## Framework Selection Guide

### By Course Type

**Technical Skills (Coding, Tools):**
- Cognitive Load Theory (chunk complexity)
- Microlearning (focused lessons)
- Kolb's Cycle (practice-heavy)

**Conceptual Knowledge (Theory, Principles):**
- Bloom's Taxonomy (build complexity)
- Constructivism (connect to prior knowledge)
- ADDIE (systematic development)

**Professional Development:**
- Backward Design (outcomes-first)
- Kirkpatrick (measure impact)
- Experiential Learning (real-world application)

---

## Framework Combinations

**GPS + Bloom's:**
- Goal: State objective using Bloom's verbs
- Position: Acknowledge prior knowledge (Bloom Level 1-2)
- Steps: Progress through Bloom levels

**ADDIE + Backward Design:**
- Analysis: Define outcomes (Backward Stage 1)
- Design: Plan assessments (Backward Stage 2)
- Development: Create lessons (Backward Stage 3)

**Didática Lendária + Cognitive Load:**
- 2-3 concepts max (manage intrinsic load)
- Analogies (reduce extraneous load)
- Practice (increase germane load)

---

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

❌ **Sage on the Stage:** Lecture-only, no interaction
❌ **Cognitive Overload:** Too many concepts at once
❌ **Toy Examples:** Unrealistic scenarios
❌ **No Practice:** Theory without application
❌ **Missing Scaffolding:** Jump from basics to advanced
