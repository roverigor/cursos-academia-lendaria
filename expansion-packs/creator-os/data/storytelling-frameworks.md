## Core Storytelling Frameworks

### 1. Hero's Journey (Joseph Campbell)

**Structure:** 12 stages of transformation

**Stages:**
1. Ordinary World - Status quo
2. Call to Adventure - Inciting incident
3. Refusal of the Call - Resistance
4. Meeting the Mentor - Guidance appears
5. Crossing the Threshold - Commitment
6. Tests, Allies, Enemies - Challenges
7. Approach to Inmost Cave - Preparation
8. Ordeal - Crisis point
9. Reward - Victory
10. The Road Back - Return journey
11. Resurrection - Final test
12. Return with Elixir - Transformation complete

**Best For:** Long-form content, courses, video series, brand narratives

**Example:**
- Before: Struggling creator overwhelmed by content demands
- Journey: Discovers AI cloning, faces skepticism, learns system
- After: Confident creator producing 10x content with authentic voice

### 2. Three-Act Structure

**Structure:** Setup → Confrontation → Resolution

**Act 1 - Setup (25%):**
- Introduce protagonist (reader/student)
- Establish status quo
- Present inciting incident (pain point)

**Act 2 - Confrontation (50%):**
- Rising action (obstacles)
- Midpoint twist (realization)
- Complications (setbacks)

**Act 3 - Resolution (25%):**
- Climax (solution)
- Falling action (implementation)
- Resolution (transformation)

**Best For:** Blog posts, video scripts, case studies

---

### 3. AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)

**Structure:** Marketing-focused persuasion

**Attention:**
- Hook (stat, question, bold claim)
- Pattern interrupt

**Interest:**
- Relevance to reader
- Problem elaboration

**Desire:**
- Solution benefits
- Social proof
- Emotional connection

**Action:**
- Clear CTA
- Remove friction
- Create urgency

**Best For:** Landing pages, sales content, email campaigns, social posts

### 4. PAS (Problem, Agitate, Solve)

**Structure:** Pain-driven narrative

**Problem:**
- Identify specific pain point
- Make it relatable

**Agitate:**
- Amplify consequences
- Show cost of inaction
- Use vivid language

**Solve:**
- Present solution
- Show transformation
- Provide proof

**Best For:** Sales pages, webinars, ads, problem-focused content

### 5. Before-After-Bridge

**Structure:** Transformation framework

**Before:**
- Current painful state
- Specific struggles

**After:**
- Desired future state
- Specific improvements

**Bridge:**
- How to get there
- Your solution

**Best For:** Testimonials, case studies, transformation stories

### 6. In Media Res (Start in the Middle)

**Structure:** Begin at action peak

**Technique:**
- Start at crisis moment
- Hook immediately
- Flash back to context
- Resume action

**Best For:** Engaging openings, video intros, attention-grabbing content

### 7. Pixar Story Spine

**Structure:** "Once upon a time..." template

**Template:**
1. Once upon a time, [status quo]
2. Every day, [routine]
3. But one day, [inciting incident]
4. Because of that, [consequence 1]
5. Because of that, [consequence 2]
6. Because of that, [consequence 3]
7. Until finally, [climax]
8. And ever since then, [new normal]
9. The moral of the story is, [lesson]

**Best For:** Case studies, brand stories, origin stories
