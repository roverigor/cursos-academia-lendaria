### Step 2: Pedagogical Design

**2.1. Framework Application**

```yaml
pedagogical_design:
  step: "Apply selected framework to course structure"

  frameworks:
    blooms_taxonomy:
      description: "6 levels of cognitive complexity"
      levels:
        1_remember: "Recall facts, terms, concepts"
        2_understand: "Explain ideas, summarize"
        3_apply: "Use information in new situations"
        4_analyze: "Break down, find patterns"
        5_evaluate: "Justify decisions, critique"
        6_create: "Design, construct, produce"

      application:
        - Map learning objectives to Bloom's levels
        - Ensure progression: start lower (remember/understand), end higher (evaluate/create)
        - Each lesson targets 1-2 levels
        - Assessments match objective levels

      example:
        beginner_course:
          lesson_1: "Remember (terminology, concepts)"
          lesson_2-3: "Understand (explain how it works)"
          lesson_4-5: "Apply (hands-on exercises)"

        advanced_course:
          lesson_1-2: "Apply (refresher + practice)"
          lesson_3-4: "Analyze (case studies, patterns)"
          lesson_5-6: "Evaluate + Create (projects, design)"

    addie:
      description: "5-phase instructional design process"
      phases:
        1_analysis:
          - "Who is the learner? (ICP)"
          - "What is the performance gap?"
          - "What are constraints? (time, resources)"

        2_design:
          - "Learning objectives (measurable)"
          - "Assessment strategy (how to measure success)"
          - "Content structure (modules, lessons)"

        3_development:
          - "Create lessons, materials, resources"
          - "Develop assessments (quizzes, projects)"

        4_implementation:
          - "Delivery plan (self-paced, cohort, hybrid)"
          - "Platform/distribution strategy"

        5_evaluation:
          - "Formative (during course - quizzes)"
          - "Summative (end of course - final project)"
          - "Learner feedback loop"

      application:
        - Follow ADDIE sequence for course design
        - This task handles Analysis, Design, Development
        - Implementation & Evaluation left to user post-generation

    microlearning:
      description: "Short, focused lessons (5-10 min each)"
      principles:
        - One concept per lesson
        - Maximum 10-15 minutes per lesson
        - Immediately actionable
        - No fluff, direct to the point

      application:
        - Break course into micro-lessons
        - Target: 5-10 min reading (1000-1500 words)
        - Each lesson = 1 key takeaway + 1 action step

      ideal_for:
        - Busy professionals
        - Founders, executives
        - Corporate onboarding

    kolb:
      description: "Experiential learning cycle"
      stages:
        1_concrete_experience: "Do something (exercise, simulation)"
        2_reflective_observation: "Reflect on what happened"
        3_abstract_conceptualization: "Form theories, connect to concepts"
        4_active_experimentation: "Apply in new context"

      application:
        - Each module follows Kolb's 4 stages
        - Lesson sequence: Practice → Reflect → Learn → Experiment

      ideal_for:
        - Transformation programs
        - Coaching courses
        - Personal development

    backward_design:
      description: "Start with end goals, work backwards"
      steps:
        1_identify_outcomes: "What should students do after course?"
        2_determine_assessment: "How will we measure success?"
        3_design_learning_experiences: "What activities lead to outcomes?"

      application:
        - Define final project/capstone first
        - Reverse-engineer: What knowledge/skills needed for project?
        - Build lessons that scaffold toward final outcome

      ideal_for:
        - Technical courses (build a product)
        - Certification programs
        - Skills-based training

  auto_recommendation_logic:
    input: {icp, learning_objectives, duration, quality_reference}

    rules:
      - if duration < 3h AND icp includes "busy": → microlearning
      - if objectives include "build" or "create": → backward_design
      - if objectives include "transformation" or "mindset": → kolb
      - if corporate/onboarding: → addie
      - else: → blooms_taxonomy (default)

    output:
      selected_framework: "{framework_name}"
      justification: "{why this framework fits ICP/objectives}"
```

**2.2. Course Structure Generation**

```yaml
structure_generation:
  step: "Create hierarchical course outline"

  prompt_to_llm: |
    Design a course structure based on:

### Step 4: Pedagogical Validation

**4.1. Alignment Check**

```yaml
alignment_validation:
  step: "Verify objectives ↔ content ↔ assessments alignment"

  method: "Automated + LLM-assisted analysis"

  checks:
    1_objectives_coverage:
      - For each learning objective:
        - Is it addressed in lesson content? (Y/N)
        - Is it assessed? (quiz, project, activity)

      scoring:
        - Coverage: % of objectives addressed in content
        - Assessment: % of objectives tested
        - Target: 100% coverage, 80%+ assessed

    2_bloom_level_progression:
      - Analyze Bloom's levels per lesson
      - Verify logical progression (low → high)
      - Check assessments match objective levels

      example:
        lesson_1: Remember/Understand (intro concepts)
        lesson_2: Understand/Apply (practice)
        lesson_3: Apply/Analyze (deeper work)
        quiz: Tests Remember + Understand
        project: Tests Apply + Create

      scoring:
        - Progression score: Levels increase appropriately?
        - Mismatch: Assessment easier than objective (red flag)

    3_content_assessment_alignment:
      - For each assessment question:
        - Was this content taught in lessons?
        - Does difficulty match lesson depth?

      prompt_to_llm: |
        Review this quiz question:
        "{question_text}"

        Was this concept covered in these lessons?
        {list_of_lesson_titles_and_summaries}

        Rate alignment: 1-5
        1 = Not covered, unfair question
        5 = Perfectly aligned, covered in depth

      scoring:
        - Average alignment score across all questions
        - Target: 4.0+

  overall_alignment_score:
    formula: |
      alignment_score = (
        objectives_coverage * 0.40 +
        bloom_progression * 0.30 +
        content_assessment_alignment * 0.30
      )

    target: ≥ 0.90 (90%+)

    if_below_target:
      actions:
        - Identify specific gaps
        - Regenerate flagged lessons/assessments
        - Re-run validation
```

**4.2. Completeness Check**

```yaml

      - [x] Examples (at least 1)
      - [x] Key takeaways (3-5 points)
      - [x] Activity/exercise (if applicable)
      - [x] Resources (if applicable)
      - [x] Transition to next lesson

    assessment_level:
      - [x] Assessment type (quiz, project, etc.)
      - [x] Instructions
      - [x] Evaluation criteria/rubric
      - [x] Answer key (if quiz)

  validation_process:
    - Parse all generated files
    - Check for presence of each component
    - Flag missing elements
    - Calculate completeness percentage

  completeness_score:
    formula: "present_components / required_components"
    target: 100%

    if_incomplete:
      actions:
        - List missing components
        - Generate missing sections
        - Re-run completeness check
```

**4.3. Voice Fidelity Validation (if expert mode)**

```yaml
fidelity_validation:
  step: "Validate instructor voice consistency"

  applies_to:
    - mode=expert with MMOS persona
    - mode=expert with custom instructor profile

  dimensions:
    1_vocabulary:
      weight: 0.30
      metrics:
        - signature_phrases_used: Count instructor's signature phrases in lessons
        - vocabulary_richness: Type-token ratio
        - domain_terminology: Proper use of instructor's jargon

      target:
        - Use 30-60% of signature phrase inventory
        - Match instructor's vocabulary richness baseline

    2_syntax:
      weight: 0.20
      metrics:
        - avg_sentence_length: Compare to instructor baseline
        - sentence_variety: Simple vs. complex sentence mix
        - punctuation_style: Em-dashes, colons, semicolons usage

      tolerance: ±20% of instructor's baseline

    3_style:
      weight: 0.25
      metrics:
        - metaphor_frequency: Count per 1000 words
        - example_types: "research" vs "stories" vs "cases"
        - rhetorical_devices: Questions, repetition, anaphora

      target:
        - 80%+ of examples match instructor's preferred types
        - Metaphor frequency within range

    4_thinking:
      weight: 0.25
      metrics:
        - argumentation_style: Deductive vs. inductive
        - reasoning_depth: Surface vs. deep analysis
        - contrarian_index: Consensus vs. counter-intuitive stance
        - intellectual_humility: Certainty vs. nuance

      target: Match instructor's cognitive patterns

  fidelity_score:
    formula: |
      fidelity = (
        vocabulary_score * 0.30 +
        syntax_score * 0.20 +
        style_score * 0.25 +
        thinking_score * 0.25
      )

    target:
      - MMOS persona: ≥ 0.90 (90%+)
      - Custom profile: ≥ 0.85 (85%+)

    grades:
      - 95-100%: A+ (Exceptional)
      - 90-94%: A (Excellent)
      - 85-89%: B+ (Very Good) ← Minimum for custom
      - 80-84%: B (Good)
      - <80%: FAIL - Regenerate required

  if_below_target:
    actions:
      - Generate fidelity report (weakest dimensions)
      - Identify specific lessons with low scores
      - Regenerate flagged lessons with stronger voice guidance
      - Re-run fidelity validation
```

**4.4. Cognitive Load Balance**

```yaml
cognitive_load_validation:
  step: "Ensure lessons don't overload students"

  principles:
    - Intrinsic load: Complexity of content itself
    - Extraneous load: Poor design, distractions
    - Germane load: Effort toward learning

  metrics:
    1_content_density:
      - Words per lesson
      - Concepts per lesson
      - New terms introduced per lesson

      thresholds:
        microlearning: Max 1500 words, 3 concepts, 5 terms
        standard: Max 2500 words, 5 concepts, 10 terms
        deep_dive: Max 4000 words, 7 concepts, 15 terms

    2_prerequisite_chain:
      - Check: Does lesson assume knowledge not yet taught?
      - Flag: Forward references without explanation
      - Validate: Dependency graph is acyclic

    3_pacing:
      - Check: Is progression too fast? (many concepts, short duration)
      - Check: Is progression too slow? (repetitive, boring)
      - Target: Balanced cognitive load curve

  validation:
    - Analyze each lesson for metrics above
    - Flag lessons exceeding thresholds
    - Prompt: "Lesson 2.3 introduces 12 new terms - too dense. Simplify or split?"

  if_overload_detected:
    actions:
      - Split dense lessons into 2 parts
      - Move advanced concepts to later lessons
      - Add prerequisite refreshers
      - Reduce jargon density
```

**4.5. Duration Realism Check**

```yaml
duration_validation:
  step: "Verify time estimates are achievable"

  formulas:
    reading_time:
      - Average reading speed: 200-250 words/min
      - Formula: word_count / 225 = minutes

    video_script_time:
      - Average speaking speed: 150 words/min
      - Formula: word_count / 150 = minutes

    exercise_time:
      - Simple exercise: 10-15 min
      - Project work: 30-60 min per phase
      - Assessment: 20-30 min (quiz), 2-4 hours (project)

  calculation:
    for_each_lesson:
      - Count words
      - Identify activities/exercises
      - Calculate: reading_time + activity_time + buffer (20%)
      - Compare to declared duration

    tolerance: ±25%

    if_mismatch:
      - Flag: "Lesson 1.2 declared 15 min, calculated 28 min"
      - Action: Adjust declared duration OR trim content

  validation:
    - Sum all lesson durations
    - Compare to course total_hours
    - Verify: Within ±15% of target
```
