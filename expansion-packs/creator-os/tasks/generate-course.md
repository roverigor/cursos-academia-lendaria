# Task: Generate Course

**Task ID:** generate-course
**Version:** 2.2
**Purpose:** Initialize course structure with greenfield/brownfield detection and unified brief document
**Owner:** Course Architect Agent
**Estimated Time:** 30-60 seconds (initialization only)
**Elicit:** true

---

## Overview

**WORKFLOW v2.1 - Greenfield/Brownfield Detection + Unified Brief**

This task initializes a course by detecting whether you're creating from scratch (greenfield) or upgrading existing materials (brownfield), validating the mode against folder state, and setting up the appropriate workflow.

**What This Task Does:**
1. Prompts for course slug (short identifier)
2. **NEW: Asks greenfield vs brownfield mode**
3. **NEW: Validates mode against folder existence (4 scenarios)**
4. **NEW: Branches to appropriate workflow**
5. Creates `/outputs/courses/{course-slug}/` directory structure (greenfield only)
6. Copies `course-brief.md` template to `COURSE-BRIEF.md` (greenfield only)
7. **HALTS and notifies user with mode-specific next steps**

**What This Task Does NOT Do:**
- Does NOT generate course content (that's `continue-course` task)
- Does NOT ask 15-20 interactive questions (v1.0 deprecated)
- Does NOT elicit requirements incrementally
- Does NOT extract brownfield materials yet (Phase 2: Stories 3.2-3.4)

**Success Criteria:**
- Mode selection validated against folder state (100% accuracy)
- Appropriate workflow executed (greenfield or brownfield)
- creation_mode metadata persisted to COURSE-BRIEF.md
- User notified with clear, context-aware next steps
- Error recovery options provided for conflicts

## Input Parameters

### Required Parameters

1. **course_slug** (string, required)
   - Description: Short identifier for the course (used in folder/file names)
   - Example: "clone-ia-express", "python-data-science", "team-onboarding"
   - Validation:
     - Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only
     - 3-50 characters
     - Must not already exist in `/outputs/courses/`
   - Format: kebab-case (e.g., "my-course-name")

### Elicitation

```yaml
elicitation:
  step: "Gather course slug and creation mode"

  questions:
    1_course_slug:
      prompt: |
        What is the course identifier (slug)?

        This will be used for:
        - Folder name: /outputs/courses/{slug}/
        - Brief file: /outputs/courses/{slug}/COURSE-BRIEF.md

        Format: lowercase, hyphens only (e.g., "my-course-name")

        Course slug:

      validation:
        - Must be 3-50 characters
        - Must be lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only

      examples:
        - "clone-ia-express"
        - "python-data-science"
        - "team-onboarding-v2"

    2_creation_mode:
      prompt: |
        Is this course:

        1. Greenfield - Creating from scratch (no existing materials)
           → Start with blank slate, fill COURSE-BRIEF manually
           → Folder should NOT exist yet

        2. Brownfield - Upgrading/migrating existing course materials
           → Extract content from existing files
           → Folder should already exist with materials

        Your choice (1 or 2):

      validation:
        - Must be 1 or 2
        - Will be validated against folder existence

      default_suggestion: |
        (Checking folder existence to suggest default...)
```

---

## Processing Pipeline

### Step 1: Brief Initialization

**1.1. Validate Course Slug**

```yaml
slug_validation:
  step: "Validate and sanitize course slug"

  checks:
    1_format:
      - Must be lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only
      - Must be 3-50 characters
      - Regex: ^[a-z0-9-]{3,50}$

  sanitization:
    - Convert to lowercase
    - Replace spaces with hyphens
    - Remove special characters
    - Trim to 50 chars if needed

  output:
    validated_slug: "{sanitized-course-slug}"
```

**1.2. Validate Creation Mode vs Folder State**

```yaml
mode_validation:
  step: "Validate creation mode matches folder existence"

  inputs:
    - validated_slug (from step 1.1)
    - creation_mode (1=greenfield, 2=brownfield from elicitation)

  checks:
    folder_path: "outputs/courses/{slug}/"
    folder_exists: "Check if path exists"
    file_count: "Count files recursively (if exists)"

  validation_scenarios:

    scenario_1_greenfield_pass:
      condition: "mode=greenfield AND folder does NOT exist"
      result: SUCCESS
      message: |
        ✓ Greenfield mode validated
        ✓ Folder does not exist (will be created)

        Proceeding to create course structure...

    scenario_2_greenfield_conflict:
      condition: "mode=greenfield AND folder EXISTS"
      result: ERROR
      message: |
        ❌ CONFLICT: Greenfield mode selected but folder already exists!

        Found: outputs/courses/{slug}/
        Contains: {file_count} files

        This suggests you meant "Brownfield" (upgrade existing course).

        Recovery options:
        1. Change to Brownfield mode (recommended)
        2. Delete existing folder and continue as Greenfield (⚠️ DESTRUCTIVE)
        3. Choose different slug

        What would you like to do? (1/2/3):

      recovery_actions:
        option_1_switch_to_brownfield:
          action: "Set creation_mode = brownfield"
          next: "Re-run validation (should pass scenario_3)"

        option_2_delete_folder:
          action: "Delete outputs/courses/{slug}/ recursively"
          confirmation: "Are you SURE? This will delete {file_count} files. Type 'DELETE' to confirm:"
          if_confirmed: "Delete folder and proceed to step 1.3"
          if_not_confirmed: "Abort and re-prompt options"

        option_3_change_slug:
          action: "Re-prompt for slug (back to elicitation step 1)"

    scenario_3_brownfield_pass:
      condition: "mode=brownfield AND folder EXISTS"
      result: SUCCESS
      message: |
        ✓ Brownfield mode validated
        ✓ Folder exists: outputs/courses/{slug}/
        ✓ Found {file_count} files

        Next: Analyzing existing materials...

    scenario_4_brownfield_conflict:
      condition: "mode=brownfield AND folder does NOT exist"
      result: ERROR
      message: |
        ❌ CONFLICT: Brownfield mode selected but no folder found!

        Expected: outputs/courses/{slug}/

        Brownfield mode requires existing materials to upgrade.

        Recovery options:
        1. Change to Greenfield mode (create new course)
        2. Create folder manually and add materials, then retry
        3. Check slug spelling (typo?)

        What would you like to do? (1/2/3):

      recovery_actions:
        option_1_switch_to_greenfield:
          action: "Set creation_mode = greenfield"
          next: "Re-run validation (should pass scenario_1)"

        option_2_manual_setup:
          action: "Halt workflow"
          instructions: |
            Please create the folder and add your materials:

            1. Create folder: mkdir -p outputs/courses/{slug}/
            2. Add your existing course materials to this folder
            3. Run this command again: *generate-course

        option_3_check_slug:
          action: "Re-prompt for slug (back to elicitation step 1)"

  output:
    creation_mode: "greenfield | brownfield"
    folder_state:
      exists: "true | false"
      file_count: "{number}"
      validated_at: "{timestamp}"
```

       - Open: `COURSE-BRIEF.md`
       - Complete ALL 8 sections (estimated time: 45-90 minutes)
       - Save the file

    2. **Continue Course Generation:**
       - Run: `*continue-course {course-slug}`
       - The system will read your brief and generate the full course

    ---

    **Created:** {timestamp}
    **Framework:** AIOS Course Creation Workflow v2.0
```

**1.6. Workflow Branching**

```yaml
workflow_branching:
  step: "Route to appropriate workflow based on creation mode"

  greenfield_workflow:
    condition: "creation_mode = greenfield"
    next_step: "Step 1.7 - User Notification & HALT (Greenfield)"
    description: "User must fill COURSE-BRIEF.md manually before generation"

  brownfield_workflow:
    condition: "creation_mode = brownfield"
    next_step: "Step 1.7 - User Notification & HALT (Brownfield)"
    description: "User should prepare materials before running extraction workflow (Phase 2)"
```

**1.7. User Notification & HALT**

**For Greenfield Mode:**

```yaml
notification_greenfield:
  step: "Notify user and HALT workflow"

  applies_to: "creation_mode = greenfield"

  message_to_user: |
    ✓ Course structure initialized successfully!

    📁 Created:
    - Folder: /outputs/courses/{course-slug}/
    - Brief: /outputs/courses/{course-slug}/COURSE-BRIEF.md
    - README: /outputs/courses/{course-slug}/README.md

    ---

    📋 **NEXT STEP - Fill the Course Brief:**

    1. Open: `outputs/courses/{course-slug}/COURSE-BRIEF.md`
    2. Complete ALL 8 sections (estimated time: 45-90 minutes):
       - Section 1: Basic Information (5-10 min)
       - Section 2: ICP & Target Audience (15-25 min)
       - Section 3: Content & Pedagogy (20-30 min)
       - Section 4: Voice & Personality (10-15 min)
       - Section 5: Format & Delivery (5-10 min)
       - Section 6: Commercial & Launch (10-15 min)
       - Section 7: Additional Context (5-10 min)
       - Section 8: Final Checklist (2 min)
    3. Save the file

    ---

    **When ready, run:**
    ```
    *continue-course {course-slug}
    ```

    This will read your brief and generate the complete course.

  workflow_state: "HALTED"
  next_task: "continue-course"
```

**For Brownfield Mode:**

```yaml
notification_brownfield:
  step: "Notify user and HALT workflow"

  applies_to: "creation_mode = brownfield"

  message_to_user: |
    ✓ Brownfield mode activated!

    📁 Detected:
    - Folder: /outputs/courses/{course-slug}/
    - Files found: {file_count}

    ---

    📋 **NEXT STEPS - Brownfield Workflow:**

    **Phase 2: Material Extraction (Future Implementation)**

    The system will extract content from your existing materials to:
    1. Generate COURSE-BRIEF.md automatically (from existing content)
    2. Identify ICP from audience descriptions
    3. Extract instructor voice patterns
    4. Map existing structure to course outline

    **For now (Phase 1 - Manual Path):**

    1. Create COURSE-BRIEF.md manually in: outputs/courses/{course-slug}/
    2. Fill all sections based on your existing materials
    3. Run: *continue-course {course-slug}

    ---

    **Status:** Brownfield workflow is planned for Story 3.2-3.4 (Phase 2)
    **Current workaround:** Use greenfield flow with manual COURSE-BRIEF.md

  workflow_state: "HALTED"
  next_task: "continue-course (after manual COURSE-BRIEF.md creation)"
  note: "Automated brownfield extraction coming in Phase 2 (Stories 3.2-3.4)"
```

    📋 **NEXT STEPS - Brownfield Workflow:**

    **Phase 2: Material Extraction (Stories 3.3-3.5) - Coming Soon**

    The system will extract content from your organized materials to:
    1. Generate COURSE-BRIEF.md automatically (Story 3.3: ICP Extraction)
    2. Extract instructor voice patterns (Story 3.4: Voice Extraction)
    3. Infer learning objectives (Story 3.5: Objectives Inference)

    **For now (Phase 1 - Manual Path):**

    1. Review organized files in canonical structure
    2. Create COURSE-BRIEF.md manually based on organized materials
    3. Run: *continue-course {course-slug}

    ---

    **Status:** File organization complete (Story 3.2 ✓)
    **Next:** Stories 3.3-3.5 will automate COURSE-BRIEF generation from your organized materials

  workflow_state: "HALTED (awaiting Phase 2 or manual COURSE-BRIEF)"
  next_task: "continue-course (after COURSE-BRIEF.md creation)"
```

### Step 2.5: ICP Extraction (Brownfield Only)

**This step runs ONLY in brownfield mode after file organization (Step 2).**

**2.5.1. Extract ICP Data from Organized Files**

```yaml
icp_extraction:
  step: "Extract ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) data from legacy files"

  applies_to: "Only runs in BROWNFIELD mode (creation_mode = brownfield)"

  skip_if: "creation_mode = greenfield (no legacy files to extract from)"

  prerequisites:
    - Brownfield mode validated (Scenario 3 passed)
    - File organization complete (Step 2.2) or skipped (manual organization)
    - COURSE-BRIEF.md exists (from greenfield template or manual creation)

      detection_strategies:
        - Filename patterns (ICP.md, avatar.md, persona.md, publico-alvo.md)
        - Content keywords ("ideal customer", "público-alvo", "target audience")
        - Confidence scoring (filename match = 85-95%, content match = 40-75%)

      output:
        - List of ICPFile objects ranked by confidence
        - Top 3 candidates displayed to user

        extractor = VoiceExtractor(course_slug, ai_client)
        transcript_files = extractor.find_transcripts()

      detection_strategies:
        - Filename patterns (transcript*.txt, aula*.txt, lesson*.txt)
        - Content validation (must contain conversational markers)
        - Multi-format support (plain text, Markdown, SRT, VTT)
        - Priority search paths (/legado/transcripts/, /legado/, /transcripts/, root)

        - Teaching approach (theory vs practice, uses analogies, etc.)
        - Interaction patterns (direct address, checks understanding)
        - Personality traits (builds confidence, addresses objections)

      caching:
        - Results cached in /legado/.voice-analysis-cache.yaml
        - Cache invalidated if transcript files change
        - Reduces cost on re-runs

      output:
        - VoiceProfile object with aggregated patterns

### Step 3: Gap Analysis & Smart Elicitation (Brownfield Only)

**This step runs ONLY in brownfield mode after all extraction steps (2.5, 2.6, 2.7).**

**3.1. Analyze COURSE-BRIEF Completeness**

```yaml
gap_analysis:
  step: "Analyze which sections are complete, partial, or missing"

  applies_to: "Only runs in BROWNFIELD mode (creation_mode = brownfield)"

  skip_if: "creation_mode = greenfield (no auto-fill to analyze)"

  prerequisites:
    - Brownfield mode validated (Scenario 3 passed)
    - File organization complete (Step 2.2) or skipped
    - ICP extraction complete (Step 2.5) or skipped
    - Voice extraction complete (Step 2.6) or skipped
    - Learning objectives inference complete (Step 2.7) or skipped
    - COURSE-BRIEF.md exists

      analysis_dimensions:
        - Section 1: Basic Information (title, slug, category, duration)
        - Section 2: ICP (demographics, psychographics, pain points, goals)
        - Section 3: Content (objectives, framework, prerequisites)
        - Section 4: Voice (tone, style, phrases, greeting)
        - Section 5: Format (lesson duration, format, assessments)
        - Section 6: Commercial (pricing, launch date, upsells)
        - Section 7: Context (references to legacy materials)
        - Section 8: Checklist (final validation items)

### Step 4: WORKFLOW HALTED

**This task STOPS here.** The user must now:

**For Greenfield:**
1. Fill `COURSE-BRIEF.md` manually (45-90 minutes)
2. Run `*continue-course {course-slug}` to generate content

**For Brownfield (after Step 3 complete):**
1. Review COURSE-BRIEF.md (all sections now 🟢 or 🟡)
2. Edit any 🟡 sections manually if needed
3. Run `*continue-course {course-slug}` to generate content

**Note:** Steps 4-7 (Pedagogical Design, Curriculum Generation, Validation, Output) are now part of the `continue-course` task.

## Error Handling

```yaml
error_scenarios:

  - error: "Course slug invalid format"
    trigger: "Slug contains invalid characters or wrong length"
    recovery:
      1: "Show validation rules"
      2: "Suggest sanitized version"
      3: "Ask user to provide new slug"
    example_message: |
      ❌ Invalid course slug: "{input_slug}"

      Rules:
      - Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only
      - 3-50 characters
      - Example: "my-course-name"

      Suggested: "{sanitized_slug}"

      Please provide a valid slug:

  - error: "Invalid creation mode selection"
    trigger: "User provides value other than 1 or 2 for mode selection"
    recovery:
      1: "Re-prompt with clear options"
      2: "Show folder existence status to help decide"
    example_message: |
      ❌ Invalid selection: "{input_value}"

      Please choose:
      1. Greenfield (creating new course from scratch)
      2. Brownfield (upgrading existing course materials)

      Note: Checking outputs/courses/{slug}/... {exists|does not exist}
      Suggestion: Choose {recommended_mode} based on folder state

      Your choice (1 or 2):

  - error: "Greenfield conflict - folder exists"
    trigger: "User selected greenfield but folder already exists"
    recovery:
      1: "Switch to brownfield mode (recommended)"
      2: "Delete folder and continue (destructive)"
      3: "Choose different slug"
    example_message: |
      ❌ CONFLICT: Greenfield mode selected but folder already exists!

      Found: outputs/courses/{slug}/
      Contains: {file_count} files

      This suggests you meant "Brownfield" (upgrade existing course).

      Recovery options:
      1. Change to Brownfield mode (recommended)
      2. Delete existing folder and continue as Greenfield (⚠️ DESTRUCTIVE)
      3. Choose different slug

      What would you like to do? (1/2/3):

  - error: "Brownfield conflict - folder missing"
    trigger: "User selected brownfield but folder doesn't exist"
    recovery:
      1: "Switch to greenfield mode"
      2: "Create folder manually and retry"
      3: "Check slug spelling"

      ❌ CONFLICT: Brownfield mode selected but no folder found!

      Expected: outputs/courses/{slug}/

      Brownfield mode requires existing materials to upgrade.

      Recovery options:
      1. Change to Greenfield mode (create new course)
      2. Create folder manually and add materials, then retry
      3. Check slug spelling (typo?)

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Greenfield - New Course from Scratch

```bash
*generate-course

# Prompt: What is the course identifier (slug)?
> clone-ia-express

# Prompt: Is this course:
# 1. Greenfield - Creating from scratch (no existing materials)
# 2. Brownfield - Upgrading/migrating existing course materials
# Your choice (1 or 2):
> 1

# System validates: folder doesn't exist ✓

# Output:
✓ Greenfield mode validated
✓ Folder does not exist (will be created)

Proceeding to create course structure...

✓ Course structure initialized successfully!

📁 Created:
- Folder: /outputs/courses/clone-ia-express/
- Brief: /outputs/courses/clone-ia-express/COURSE-BRIEF.md
- README: /outputs/courses/clone-ia-express/README.md

---

📋 **NEXT STEP - Fill the Course Brief:**

1. Open: `outputs/courses/clone-ia-express/COURSE-BRIEF.md`
2. Complete ALL 8 sections (estimated time: 45-90 minutes)
3. Save the file

**When ready, run:**
```
*continue-course clone-ia-express
```
```

### Example 2: Brownfield - Upgrade Existing Course

```bash
*generate-course

# Prompt: What is the course identifier (slug)?
> dominando-obsidian

# Prompt: Is this course:
# 1. Greenfield - Creating from scratch (no existing materials)
# 2. Brownfield - Upgrading/migrating existing course materials
# Your choice (1 or 2):
> 2

# System validates: folder exists with 42 files ✓

# Output:
✓ Brownfield mode validated
✓ Folder exists: outputs/courses/dominando-obsidian/
✓ Found 42 files

Next: Analyzing existing materials...

---

✓ Brownfield mode activated!

📁 Detected:
- Folder: /outputs/courses/dominando-obsidian/
- Files found: 42

---

📋 **NEXT STEPS - Brownfield Workflow:**

**Phase 2: Material Extraction (Future Implementation)**

The system will extract content from your existing materials to:
1. Generate COURSE-BRIEF.md automatically (from existing content)
2. Identify ICP from audience descriptions
3. Extract instructor voice patterns
4. Map existing structure to course outline

**For now (Phase 1 - Manual Path):**

1. Create COURSE-BRIEF.md manually in: outputs/courses/dominando-obsidian/
2. Fill all sections based on your existing materials
3. Run: *continue-course dominando-obsidian

---

**Status:** Brownfield workflow is planned for Story 3.2-3.4 (Phase 2)
**Current workaround:** Use greenfield flow with manual COURSE-BRIEF.md
```

### Example 3: Error - Greenfield Conflict (Folder Exists)

```bash
*generate-course

# Prompt: What is the course identifier (slug)?
> clone-ia-express

# Prompt: Is this course:
# 1. Greenfield - Creating from scratch (no existing materials)
# 2. Brownfield - Upgrading/migrating existing course materials
# Your choice (1 or 2):
> 1

# System checks: folder DOES exist!

# Output:
❌ CONFLICT: Greenfield mode selected but folder already exists!

Found: outputs/courses/clone-ia-express/
Contains: 15 files

This suggests you meant "Brownfield" (upgrade existing course).

Recovery options:
1. Change to Brownfield mode (recommended)
2. Delete existing folder and continue as Greenfield (⚠️ DESTRUCTIVE)
3. Choose different slug

What would you like to do? (1/2/3):
> 1

# User chooses option 1 - system switches to brownfield
✓ Switched to Brownfield mode
✓ Folder exists: outputs/courses/clone-ia-express/
✓ Found 15 files

[... continues with brownfield workflow ...]
```

### Example 4: Error - Brownfield Conflict (Folder Missing)

```bash
*generate-course

# Prompt: What is the course identifier (slug)?
> new-course

# Prompt: Is this course:
# 1. Greenfield - Creating from scratch (no existing materials)
# 2. Brownfield - Upgrading/migrating existing course materials
# Your choice (1 or 2):
> 2

# System checks: folder does NOT exist!

# Output:
❌ CONFLICT: Brownfield mode selected but no folder found!

Expected: outputs/courses/new-course/

Brownfield mode requires existing materials to upgrade.

Recovery options:
1. Change to Greenfield mode (create new course)
2. Create folder manually and add materials, then retry
3. Check slug spelling (typo?)

What would you like to do? (1/2/3):
> 1

# User chooses option 1 - system switches to greenfield
✓ Switched to Greenfield mode
✓ Folder does not exist (will be created)

[... continues with greenfield workflow ...]
```

## Related Tasks

- **`continue-course`** - Reads filled COURSE-BRIEF.md and generates full course content (Steps 2-5 from v1.0)
- **`update-course`** - Modifies existing course based on feedback (future)
- **`export-course`** - Exports course to platform format (future)

## Migration Notes (v1.0 → v2.0)

**Breaking Changes:**
- ❌ **REMOVED:** Interactive elicitation (15-20 questions)
- ❌ **REMOVED:** Mode selection (generic/expert/legacy)
- ❌ **REMOVED:** Immediate content generation
- ✅ **ADDED:** Unified brief document approach
- ✅ **ADDED:** Two-step workflow (generate-course → continue-course)

**Why Changed:**
1. **Context Loss:** v1.0 required maintaining context across 15-20 Q&A rounds
2. **Interruptions:** User had to stay present for entire generation (15-45 min)
3. **No Iteration:** Couldn't revise requirements without regenerating
4. **Better UX:** v2.0 allows users to thoughtfully fill brief offline, review, iterate

**Migration Path:**
- If using v1.0 workflow: Switch to v2.0 by using `*generate-course` + `*continue-course`
- Old v1.0 task backed up at: `expansion-packs/creator-os/tasks/generate-course-v1-backup.md`
