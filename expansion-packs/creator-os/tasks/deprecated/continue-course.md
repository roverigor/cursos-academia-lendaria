# Task: Continue Course Generation

**Task ID:** continue-course
**Version:** 2.3
**Purpose:** Read filled course brief and generate complete course content with pedagogical rigor
**Owner:** Course Architect Agent
**Estimated Time:** 15-45 minutes (depending on course size)
**Elicit:** false

---

## Overview

**WORKFLOW v2.3 - Brief-Driven Generation with Error Recovery**

This task continues course generation after the user has filled the unified COURSE-BRIEF.md document. It includes checkpoint-based recovery to prevent loss of progress if interrupted (CTRL+C, API failures, power outages).

**New in v2.3 (Story 3.11):**
- Checkpoint state files at 4 levels (brief, curriculum, every 5 lessons)
- Interrupt handling (CTRL+C, SIGTERM) with graceful state save
- Resume command: `--resume` flag loads latest state and continues
- Idempotent resume (safe to run multiple times)
- Auto-cleanup state files on successful completion

This task continues course generation after the user has filled the unified COURSE-BRIEF.md document. It reads the brief, validates completeness, and generates all course content (lessons, assessments, resources) with pedagogical frameworks and optional MMOS persona voice.

**Prerequisites:**
1. Course initialized with `*generate-course {slug}`
2. `COURSE-BRIEF.md` filled completely (all 8 sections)

**What This Task Does:**
1. Loads and validates filled COURSE-BRIEF.md
2. Applies pedagogical framework (Bloom's, ADDIE, Microlearning, etc.)
3. Generates course structure and curriculum
4. Creates lesson content with instructor voice (if specified)
5. Generates assessments and resources
6. Validates alignment, completeness, voice fidelity
7. Outputs final course files

**Success Criteria:**
- Course structure pedagogically sound (alignment score 90%+)
- Lessons maintain instructor voice (fidelity 85-90%+ if MMOS persona used)
- Human-in-the-loop workflow with preview/approval checkpoints
- Requires <20% manual editing after generation
- Output: Markdown lessons, YAML curriculum, database logging

---

## Input Parameters

### Required Parameters

1. **course_slug** (string, required)
   - Description: Course identifier (same as used in `*generate-course`)
   - Example: "clone-ia-express", "python-data-science"
   - Validation:
     - Must exist in `/outputs/courses/{slug}/`
     - Must have filled `COURSE-BRIEF.md`

### Optional Flags (NEW - v2.3)

2. **--resume** (flag, optional)
   - Description: Resume from last checkpoint instead of starting fresh
   - When to use: After CTRL+C interrupt, API failure, or power outage
   - Behavior:
     - Loads latest state from `outputs/courses/{slug}/.state/`
     - Validates state is not corrupted
     - Validates context files still exist (curriculum.yaml, etc.)
     - Skips completed lessons, continues from next pending
     - Displays resume summary before continuing
   - Example: `*continue-course dominando-obsidian --resume`

3. **--force** (flag, optional)
   - Description: Start fresh, ignoring any saved state
   - When to use: To regenerate from scratch, abandoning saved progress
   - Example: `*continue-course dominando-obsidian --force`

4. **--force-context** (flag, optional)
   - Description: Skip context validation (risky)
   - When to use: When curriculum changed but you want to resume anyway
   - Requires: `--resume` flag
   - Example: `*continue-course dominando-obsidian --resume --force-context`

---

## Processing Pipeline

### Step 0: Resume Check (NEW - v2.3)

**If `--resume` flag is provided, load state and skip to checkpoint.**

```python
from lib.state_manager import resume_course_generation

# Check if resume flag is present
if args.resume:
    try:
        # Load and validate state
        latest_state = resume_course_generation(
            course_slug=course_slug,
            force_context=args.force_context
        )

        # Resume from checkpoint based on next_step
        next_step = latest_state.get("next_step")

        if next_step == "generate_lessons":
            # Skip to Step 5 (full lesson generation)
            # Curriculum already approved
            curriculum_path = latest_state["context"]["curriculum_path"]
            with open(curriculum_path, 'r') as f:
                curriculum_data = yaml.safe_load(f)

            # Jump to Step 5
            print("→ Resuming from Step 5: Lesson Generation\n")
            # ... continue to Step 5 ...

        elif next_step == "continue_lessons":
            # Resume lesson generation (skip completed)
            completed_ids = set(latest_state["progress"]["completed_list"])

            # Load curriculum
            curriculum_path = latest_state["context"]["curriculum_path"]
            with open(curriculum_path, 'r') as f:
                curriculum_data = yaml.safe_load(f)

            # Filter out completed lessons
            pending_lessons = [
                lesson for lesson in flatten_curriculum(curriculum_data)
                if lesson["lesson_id"] not in completed_ids
            ]

            # Display resume progress
            total = latest_state["progress"]["lessons_total"]
            completed = latest_state["progress"]["lessons_completed"]
            last_completed = latest_state["progress"]["last_completed"]
            next_pending = pending_lessons[0]["lesson_id"] if pending_lessons else None

            print(f"""
📊 RESUME PROGRESS:
   Completed: {completed}/{total} lessons
   Remaining: {len(pending_lessons)} lessons
   Last completed: {last_completed}
   Next: {next_pending}
            """)

            # Generate remaining lessons
            # Jump to Step 5 with filtered lesson list
            # ... continue to Step 5 with pending_lessons ...

        else:
            print(f"⚠️  Unknown next_step: {next_step}")
            print("Starting from Step 1 (default workflow)")

    except StateNotFoundError as e:
        print(f"❌ {e}")
        sys.exit(1)

    except StateCorruptedError as e:
        print(f"❌ {e}")
        sys.exit(1)

    except ContextChangedError as e:
        print(f"❌ {e}")
        sys.exit(1)

# If not resuming, continue with normal workflow (Step 1)
```

### Step 2: Pedagogical Design

**(Implementation from v1.0 - adapted for brief-driven approach)**

**2.1. Framework Application**

```yaml
pedagogical_design:
  step: "Apply selected framework from brief to course structure"

  input_source: course_config.pedagogical_framework

  frameworks:
    blooms_taxonomy:
      description: "6 levels of cognitive complexity"
      levels:
        1_remember: "Recall facts, terms, concepts"
        2_understand: "Explain ideas, summarize"
        3_apply: "Use information in new situations"
        4_analyze: "Break down, find patterns"
        5_evaluate: "Justify decisions, critique"
        6_create: "Design, construct, produce"

      application:
        - Map learning objectives (from brief Section 3.2) to Bloom's levels
        - Ensure progression: start lower (remember/understand), end higher (evaluate/create)
        - Each lesson targets 1-2 levels
        - Assessments match objective levels

    addie:
      description: "5-phase instructional design process"
      phases:
        1_analysis: "ICP from brief Section 2"
        2_design: "Learning objectives from brief Section 3.2"
        3_development: "Generate lessons, assessments"
        4_implementation: "User handles post-generation"
        5_evaluation: "Formative + summative assessments"

      application:
        - Analysis phase: Use ICP from brief
        - Design phase: Use objectives + outline from brief
        - Development: Generate content
        - Implementation & Evaluation: User responsibility

    microlearning:
      description: "Short, focused lessons (5-10 min each)"
      principles:
        - One concept per lesson
        - Maximum 10-15 minutes per lesson
        - Immediately actionable
        - No fluff, direct to the point

      application:
        - Break course into micro-lessons
        - Target: 5-10 min reading (1000-1500 words)
        - Each lesson = 1 key takeaway + 1 action step

      ideal_for:
        - Busy professionals (check ICP from brief)
        - Founders, executives
        - Corporate onboarding

    kolb:
      description: "Experiential learning cycle"
      stages:
        1_concrete_experience: "Do something (exercise, simulation)"
        2_reflective_observation: "Reflect on what happened"
        3_abstract_conceptualization: "Form theories, connect to concepts"
        4_active_experimentation: "Apply in new context"

      application:
        - Each module follows Kolb's 4 stages
        - Lesson sequence: Practice → Reflect → Learn → Experiment

    backward_design:
      description: "Start with end goals, work backwards"
      steps:
        1_identify_outcomes: "Use objectives from brief Section 3.2"
        2_determine_assessment: "Design final project first"
        3_design_learning_experiences: "Build lessons that scaffold"

      application:
        - Define final project/capstone first
        - Reverse-engineer: What knowledge/skills needed?
        - Build lessons that scaffold toward final outcome

  output:
    selected_framework: "{from_brief or auto-recommended}"
    framework_guidelines: "{specific rules for this framework}"
```

**2.2. Course Structure Generation**

```yaml
structure_generation:
  step: "Generate detailed course outline based on brief"

  input_sources:
    - course_title (brief Section 1.1)

### Step 3: Curriculum Generation

**(Implementation from v1.0 - adapted for brief-driven approach)**

**3.1. Generate curriculum.yaml from approved outline**

```yaml
curriculum_yaml_generation:
  step: "Convert outline to structured curriculum.yaml"

  input_sources:
    - course_outline (from Step 2.2 approved output)
    - course_config (from Step 1.2 brief)

  output_file: "outputs/courses/{slug}/curriculum.yaml"

  structure:
    course_id: "{uuid}"
    title: "{from_brief}"
    slug: "{slug}"
    version: "1.0"
    created_at: "{timestamp}"

    metadata:
      total_duration_hours: {from_brief}
      knowledge_level: "{from_brief}"
      target_audience: "{from_brief}"
      pedagogical_framework: "{from_brief}"
      teaching_style: "{from_brief}"

    modules:
      - module_id: 1
        module_title: "{from_outline}"
        duration_minutes: {calculated}
        lessons:
          - lesson_id: "1.1"
            lesson_title: "{from_outline}"
            duration_minutes: {from_outline}
            learning_objectives: [...]
            bloom_level: "{from_outline}"
          - lesson_id: "1.2"
            # ...
```

### Step 4: Curriculum Approval Checkpoint (MANDATORY HALT)

**CRITICAL:** This is a human-in-the-loop checkpoint that HALTS the workflow to prevent costly mistakes.

**Story:** STORY-3.8 - Curriculum Approval Checkpoint

**4.1. Display Curriculum Summary**

    basis: "Claude Sonnet 4 generation time"
```

**4.2. Present Approval Options (NEVER AUTO-APPROVE)**

```yaml
approval_options:
  step: "Wait for explicit user choice"

  display: |
    ⏸️  CHECKPOINT: Approve curriculum?

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Options:

    [1] ✅ APPROVE
        → Generate all {lesson_count} lessons now
        → Estimated cost: ${cost_min}-${cost_max} | Time: {time_min}-{time_max} min
        → Cannot undo (lessons will be generated)

    [2] ✏️  EDIT CURRICULUM
        → Modify curriculum.yaml manually in your editor
        → Add/remove lessons, adjust titles/durations
        → Return here when done to validate changes

    [3] 🔄 REGENERATE CURRICULUM
        → Go back to COURSE-BRIEF.md and adjust
        → Re-run outline and curriculum generation
        → Use if structure needs major changes

    [4] ❌ CANCEL WORKFLOW
        → Stop here without generating lessons
        → Progress saved (COURSE-BRIEF, curriculum preserved)
        → Resume later with: *continue-course {slug}

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    💡 TIP: Most users choose [2] to tweak lesson titles before approval.

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Your choice (1-4): _

  validation:
    - User MUST enter 1, 2, 3, or 4 (no default)
    - No config option to bypass checkpoint
    - All decisions logged for audit

  critical_rule: |
    NEVER auto-approve curriculum, even if:
    - User has "auto_approve_curriculum: true" in config (ignore it)
    - Curriculum looks perfect (still require human review)
    - User is in batch mode (still HALT)

    Rationale: This is a "spend money" gate - must be explicit
```

**4.3. Handle User Choice**

```yaml
option_handlers:

  option_1_approve:
    handler: "CurriculumApprovalCheckpoint.handle_option_approve()"

    workflow:
      1_confirmation_prompt: |
         ⚠️  This will generate all {lesson_count} lessons and incur costs (${cost_min}-${cost_max}).
            Are you sure? (yes/no): _

      2_validate_confirmation:
         - If "yes": Proceed to option_1_approve_confirmed
         - If "no": Return to approval_options
         - Any other input: Return to approval_options

      3_approve_confirmed:
         - Log approval decision
         - Return: "proceed_to_generation"
         - Continue to Step 5 (Lesson Generation)

    critical_rule: "Require explicit 'yes' confirmation (safety check)"

  option_2_edit:
    handler: "CurriculumApprovalCheckpoint.handle_option_edit()"

    workflow:
      1_display_instructions: |
         ✏️  EDIT MODE

         1. Open curriculum file:
            {curriculum_path}

         2. Make your changes:
            - Add/remove lessons
            - Adjust titles, durations, or learning objectives
            - Reorder modules

         3. Save the file

         4. Return here and press ENTER to validate changes

         ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

         💡 TIPS:
            - Keep numbering sequential (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, ...)
            - Lesson duration: 10-45 minutes typical
            - Use YAML syntax (indentation matters!)

         ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

         When done editing, press ENTER to continue: _

      2_wait_for_user: "input() - User edits file externally"

      3_revalidate_curriculum:
         - Run: validate_curriculum_yaml(curriculum_path)
         - If validation fails:
           - Display errors
           - Show fix instructions
           - HALT with resume command
         - If validation passes:
           - Display success
           - Reload curriculum data
           - Re-display curriculum summary
           - Return to approval_options (loop)

    validation_rules:
      - YAML syntax valid
      - Modules list exists and not empty
      - Each module has lessons
      - Lesson IDs sequential (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, ...)
      - No duplicate lesson IDs
      - Total duration reasonable (60-3000 min)

  option_3_regenerate:

         This will:
         1. Return to COURSE-BRIEF.md for editing
         2. Re-run outline generation
         3. Re-run curriculum generation
         4. Return to this checkpoint

         Current curriculum.yaml will be backed up as curriculum-backup-{timestamp}.yaml

         ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

         → Proceed with regeneration? (yes/no): _

      2_get_confirmation:
         - If "yes": Continue to step 3
         - If "no": Return to approval_options

      3_backup_curriculum:
         - Copy curriculum.yaml to curriculum-backup-{timestamp}.yaml
         - Log backup path

      4_provide_instructions: |
         📝 EDIT COURSE-BRIEF.md

         1. Open: outputs/courses/{slug}/COURSE-BRIEF.md
         2. Make changes (objectives, structure, etc.)
         3. Save the file
         4. Run: *continue-course {slug} --regenerate-curriculum

         Workflow will regenerate outline + curriculum based on updated brief.

         ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

      5_halt_workflow:
         - Log regeneration decision
         - Return: "halt_for_brief_edit"
         - Workflow HALTS (user must manually resume)

  option_4_cancel:

         Option C: Start over (regenerate curriculum)
           → *continue-course {slug} --regenerate-curriculum

         ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

      2_log_decision:
         - Log: "User canceled workflow at curriculum checkpoint"

      3_halt_workflow:

```

**4.4. Curriculum Validation Logic**

  return_format:
    valid: true/false
    errors: [...]  # Blocking errors
    warnings: [...]  # Non-blocking warnings
```

**4.5. Implementation Code (with State Checkpoint - NEW v2.3)**

```python
# In continue-course workflow Step 4:

from lib.curriculum_approval import CurriculumApprovalCheckpoint
from lib.state_manager import StateManager  # NEW - v2.3

# Initialize state manager
state_manager = StateManager(course_slug)  # NEW - v2.3

# After curriculum.yaml generation (Step 3.1)
checkpoint = CurriculumApprovalCheckpoint(course_slug)

# Display summary
checkpoint.display_curriculum_summary()

# Show options and get user choice
result = checkpoint.show_approval_options()

# Handle result
if result == "proceed_to_generation":
    # User approved - SAVE CHECKPOINT (NEW - v2.3)
    curriculum_path = f"outputs/courses/{course_slug}/curriculum.yaml"

    with open(curriculum_path, 'r') as f:
        curriculum = yaml.safe_load(f)
    total_lessons = sum(
        len(module.get("lessons", []))
        for module in curriculum.get("modules", [])
    )

    state_manager.save_checkpoint({

    sys.exit(0)

elif result == "halt_canceled":
    # User canceled - HALT gracefully
    print("\n→ Workflow canceled by user.\n")
    sys.exit(0)
```

**4.6. Success Criteria**

```yaml
success_criteria:
  - ✅ 100% of workflows HALT at curriculum checkpoint
  - ✅ Zero accidental lesson generations (always require approval)
  - ✅ All approval decisions logged for audit
  - ✅ Validation catches YAML errors before lesson generation
  - ✅ User can edit/regenerate/cancel without losing progress
  - ✅ Resume instructions provided for all HALT scenarios
```

### Step 5: Lesson Generation (GPS + Didática Lendária)

**(Only runs after explicit approval from Step 4)**

**GATE:** This step only executes if Step 4 returns "proceed_to_generation"

**Story:** STORY-3.9 - Lesson Generation with GPS + Didática Lendária

**5.1. Initialize Lesson Generator**

```python

### Step 6: Pedagogical Validation

**(Implementation from v1.0 - adapted for brief-driven approach)**

**6.1. Alignment Check**

```yaml
alignment_validation:
  step: "Verify objectives ↔ content ↔ assessments alignment"

  method: "Automated + LLM-assisted analysis"

  checks:
    1_objectives_coverage:
      - For each learning objective (from brief Section 3.2):
        - Is it addressed in lesson content? (Y/N)
        - Is it assessed? (quiz, project, activity)

      scoring:
        - Coverage: % of objectives addressed in content
        - Assessment: % of objectives tested
        - Target: 100% coverage, 80%+ assessed

    2_bloom_level_progression:
      - Analyze Bloom's levels per lesson
      - Verify logical progression (low → high)
      - Check assessments match objective levels

      scoring:
        - Progression score: Levels increase appropriately?
        - Mismatch: Assessment easier than objective (red flag)

    3_content_assessment_alignment:
      - For each assessment question:
        - Was this content taught in lessons?
        - Does difficulty match lesson depth?

      prompt_to_llm: |
        Review this quiz question:
        "{question_text}"

        Was this concept covered in these lessons?
        {list_of_lesson_titles_and_summaries}

        Rate alignment: 1-5
        1 = Not covered, unfair question
        5 = Perfectly aligned, covered in depth

      scoring:
        - Average alignment score across all questions
        - Target: 4.0+

  overall_alignment_score:
    formula: |
      alignment_score = (
        objectives_coverage * 0.40 +
        bloom_progression * 0.30 +
        content_assessment_alignment * 0.30
      )

    target: ≥ 0.90 (90%+)

    if_below_target:
      actions:
        - Identify specific gaps
        - Regenerate flagged lessons/assessments
        - Re-run validation
```

**6.2. Completeness Check**

```yaml
completeness_validation:
  step: "Ensure all required components are present"

  required_components:
    course_level:
      - [x] Course title

    module_level:
      - [x] Module title
      - [x] Module objectives
      - [x] Duration estimate
      - [x] List of lessons
      - [x] Module summary/recap

    lesson_level:
      - [x] Lesson title
      - [x] Learning objectives (1-3 per lesson)
      - [x] Duration estimate
      - [x] Hook/intro
      - [x] Core content
      - [x] Examples (at least 1)
      - [x] Key takeaways (3-5 points)
      - [x] Activity/exercise (if applicable)
      - [x] Resources (if applicable)
      - [x] Transition to next lesson

    assessment_level:
      - [x] Assessment type (quiz, project, etc.)
      - [x] Instructions
      - [x] Evaluation criteria/rubric
      - [x] Answer key (if quiz)

  validation_process:
    - Parse all generated files
    - Check for presence of each component
    - Flag missing elements
    - Calculate completeness percentage

  completeness_score:
    formula: "present_components / required_components"
    target: 100%

    if_incomplete:
      actions:
        - List missing components
        - Generate missing sections
        - Re-run completeness check
```

**6.3. Voice Fidelity Validation (if expert mode)**

```yaml
fidelity_validation:
  step: "Validate instructor voice consistency"

  applies_to:
    - mode=mmos (MMOS persona from brief Section 4.1)
    - mode=custom (custom instructor profile from brief Section 4.1)

  input_sources:
    - instructor_persona (from Step 1.4 output)
    - generated_lessons (from Step 3.1 output)
    - voice_profile (from brief Section 4.1)

  dimensions:
    1_vocabulary:
      weight: 0.30
      metrics:
        - signature_phrases_used: Count instructor's signature phrases in lessons
        - vocabulary_richness: Type-token ratio
        - domain_terminology: Proper use of instructor's jargon

      target:
        - Use 30-60% of signature phrase inventory
        - Match instructor's vocabulary richness baseline

    2_syntax:
      weight: 0.20
      metrics:
        - avg_sentence_length: Compare to instructor baseline
        - sentence_variety: Simple vs. complex sentence mix
        - punctuation_style: Em-dashes, colons, semicolons usage

      tolerance: ±20% of instructor's baseline

    3_style:
      weight: 0.25
      metrics:
        - metaphor_frequency: Count per 1000 words
        - example_types: "research" vs "stories" vs "cases"
        - rhetorical_devices: Questions, repetition, anaphora

      target:
        - 80%+ of examples match instructor's preferred types
        - Metaphor frequency within range

    4_thinking:
      weight: 0.25
      metrics:
        - argumentation_style: Deductive vs. inductive
        - reasoning_depth: Surface vs. deep analysis
        - contrarian_index: Consensus vs. counter-intuitive stance
        - intellectual_humility: Certainty vs. nuance

      target: Match instructor's cognitive patterns

  fidelity_score:
    formula: |
      fidelity = (
        vocabulary_score * 0.30 +
        syntax_score * 0.20 +
        style_score * 0.25 +
        thinking_score * 0.25
      )

    target:
      - MMOS persona: ≥ 0.90 (90%+)
      - Custom profile: ≥ 0.85 (85%+)

    grades:
      - 95-100%: A+ (Exceptional)
      - 90-94%: A (Excellent)
      - 85-89%: B+ (Very Good) ← Minimum for custom
      - 80-84%: B (Good)
      - <80%: FAIL - Regenerate required

  if_below_target:
    actions:
      - Generate fidelity report (weakest dimensions)
      - Identify specific lessons with low scores
      - Regenerate flagged lessons with stronger voice guidance
      - Re-run fidelity validation
```

**6.4. Cognitive Load Balance**

```yaml
cognitive_load_validation:
  step: "Ensure lessons don't overload students"

  input_sources:
    - duration_per_lesson (from brief Section 1.2)
    - knowledge_level (from brief Section 1.2)
    - generated_lessons (from Step 3.1 output)

  principles:
    - Intrinsic load: Complexity of content itself
    - Extraneous load: Poor design, distractions
    - Germane load: Effort toward learning

  metrics:
    1_content_density:
      - Words per lesson
      - Concepts per lesson
      - New terms introduced per lesson

      thresholds:
        microlearning: Max 1500 words, 3 concepts, 5 terms
        standard: Max 2500 words, 5 concepts, 10 terms
        deep_dive: Max 4000 words, 7 concepts, 15 terms

    2_prerequisite_chain:
      - Check: Does lesson assume knowledge not yet taught?
      - Flag: Forward references without explanation
      - Validate: Dependency graph is acyclic

    3_pacing:
      - Check: Is progression too fast? (many concepts, short duration)
      - Check: Is progression too slow? (repetitive, boring)
      - Target: Balanced cognitive load curve

  validation:
    - Analyze each lesson for metrics above
    - Flag lessons exceeding thresholds
    - Prompt: "Lesson 2.3 introduces 12 new terms - too dense. Simplify or split?"

  if_overload_detected:
    actions:
      - Split dense lessons into 2 parts
      - Move advanced concepts to later lessons
      - Add prerequisite refreshers
      - Reduce jargon density
```

**6.5. Duration Realism Check**

```yaml
duration_validation:
  step: "Verify time estimates are achievable"

  input_sources:
    - declared_duration (from brief Section 1.2)
    - generated_lessons (from Step 3.1 output)

  formulas:
    reading_time:
      - Average reading speed: 200-250 words/min
      - Formula: word_count / 225 = minutes

    video_script_time:
      - Average speaking speed: 150 words/min
      - Formula: word_count / 150 = minutes

    exercise_time:
      - Simple exercise: 10-15 min
      - Project work: 30-60 min per phase
      - Assessment: 20-30 min (quiz), 2-4 hours (project)

  calculation:
    for_each_lesson:
      - Count words
      - Identify activities/exercises
      - Calculate: reading_time + activity_time + buffer (20%)
      - Compare to declared duration (from brief)

    tolerance: ±25%

    if_mismatch:
      - Flag: "Lesson 1.2 declared 15 min, calculated 28 min"
      - Action: Adjust declared duration OR trim content

  validation:
    - Sum all lesson durations
    - Compare to course total_hours (from brief Section 1.2)
    - Verify: Within ±15% of target
```

## Related Tasks

- **`generate-course`** - Initializes course structure and brief template
- **`update-course`** - Modifies existing course (future)
- **`export-course`** - Exports to platform format (future)

**Task Version:** 2.2
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-18
**Maintainer:** CreatorOS Team (Sarah - PO)
**Changelog:**
- v2.2 (2025-10-18): **MAJOR UPDATE** - Implemented STORY-3.9: Lesson Generation with GPS + Didática Lendária. Step 5 now uses GPS Framework (Goal → Position → Steps) + 7 Elements for transformational learning. Added LessonGenerator class, GPS validator, DL scorer, voice injection priority (MMOS > Transcripts > Manual), real-time progress tracking, and comprehensive error handling with retry logic.
- v2.1 (2025-10-18): Added Step 4 - Curriculum Approval Checkpoint (STORY-3.8). Mandatory HITL gate that HALTS workflow after curriculum generation to prevent costly mistakes. Renumbered subsequent steps (old Step 4 → Step 6, old Step 5 → Step 7).
- v2.0 (2025-10-17): Created as companion to generate-course v2.0. Implements brief-driven generation (Steps 2-5 from v1.0, adapted to read from COURSE-BRIEF.md instead of interactive elicitation).
- Full implementation: ~2,600 lines (complete pipeline with GPS lesson generation + validation + approval checkpoint)

---

**NOTE:** This is the complete implementation with mandatory approval checkpoint. The task now:

1. ✅ Reads filled COURSE-BRIEF.md
2. ✅ Validates completeness
3. ✅ Loads instructor persona (MMOS or custom)
4. ✅ Applies pedagogical frameworks
5. ✅ Generates course structure and curriculum.yaml
6. ✅ **HALTS at Curriculum Approval Checkpoint (STORY-3.8)**
7. ✅ Waits for explicit user approval before lesson generation
8. ✅ Creates lesson content with voice fidelity (only after approval)
9. ✅ Generates assessments and resources
10. ✅ Validates alignment, completeness, fidelity, cognitive load
11. ✅ Outputs final files and database records
12. ✅ Provides quality scores and next steps

Ready for integration testing and production use.
