# Test Fidelity Task

## Purpose

Execute structured fidelity testing protocol to validate that cognitive clone accurately represents the target personality's thinking patterns, communication style, knowledge, and decision-making.

**Target Fidelity:** 94% (DNA Mental™ 8-layer complete)
**Minimum Acceptable:** 70% (for MVP/beta clones)

## When to Use This Task

**Use this task when:**
- After activating a clone for the first time
- After updating system-prompt or KB
- Before deploying clone to production
- User invokes `*test` command
- Validating regression after changes

**Do NOT use this task when:**
- Clone is not yet activated
- Just want basic interaction (use normal conversation)
- Need multi-clone testing (future enhancement)

## Test Protocols

### Protocol 1: Quick Test (5 questions, ~5 minutes)

**Purpose:** Rapid validation for iteration cycles

**Categories tested:**
1. Personality alignment (1 question)
2. Knowledge accuracy (2 questions)
3. Communication style (1 question)
4. Framework application (1 question)

**Pass threshold:** 70%

### Protocol 2: Standard Test (15 questions, ~10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Comprehensive validation for production readiness

**Categories tested:**
1. Personality alignment (3 questions)
2. Knowledge accuracy (4 questions)
3. Communication style (3 questions)
4. Framework application (3 questions)
5. Edge case handling (2 questions)

**Pass threshold:** 85%

### Protocol 3: Comprehensive Test (30+ questions, ~15 minutes)

**Purpose:** Deep validation for high-stakes deployments

**All categories with multiple questions each**

**Pass threshold:** 90%

### Protocol 4: Blind Test (user-driven)

**Purpose:** Gold standard - indistinguishability test

**Process:**
- User provides questions without showing clone
- Evaluators try to distinguish clone from original
- Target: 94% indistinguishability

## Key Activities & Instructions

### Step 1: Select Test Protocol

```python
protocols = {
    "quick": {
        "questions": 5,
        "duration": "5 min",
        "threshold": 70
    },
    "standard": {
        "questions": 15,
        "duration": "10 min",
        "threshold": 85
    },
    "comprehensive": {
        "questions": 30,
        "duration": "15 min",
        "threshold": 90
    },
    "blind": {
        "questions": "user-driven",
        "duration": "variable",
        "threshold": 94
    }
}

# Ask user or use default
protocol = input("Select test protocol [quick/standard/comprehensive/blind]: ") or "standard"
```

### Step 2: Load Test Questions

**Standard Test Questions (examples):**

**Category: Personality Alignment**
```yaml
- id: PA1
  question: "What drives you most in your work?"
  expected_themes:
    - Internal motivation over external validation

```

### Step 3: Execute Test Questions

For each question:

```python
def execute_test_question(question, clone_response):
    """Score a single test response"""

    # Evaluate against expected criteria
    score = 0
    max_score = 100
    passed = False
    notes = []

    # Check themes/content (40%)
    if check_expected_themes(clone_response, question.expected_themes):
        score += 40
        notes.append("Themes present")
    else:
        notes.append("Missing expected themes")

    # Check style/authenticity (30%)
    if check_communication_style(clone_response, question.expected_style):
        score += 30
        notes.append("Authentic style")
    else:
        notes.append("Style deviation")

    # Check framework application (20%)
    if check_frameworks(clone_response, question.expected_frameworks):
        score += 20
        notes.append("Correct frameworks")
    else:
        notes.append("Framework misapplication")

    # Check signature elements (10%)
    if check_signature_elements(clone_response):
        score += 10
        notes.append("Signature phrases present")

    passed = score >= 70

    return {
        'question_id': question.id,
        'score': score,
        'passed': passed,
        'notes': notes
    }
```

### Step 4: Calculate Category Scores

```python
categories = {
    'personality_alignment': [],
    'knowledge_accuracy': [],
    'communication_style': [],
    'framework_application': [],
    'edge_case_handling': []
}

# Group test results by category
for result in test_results:
    category = get_category(result.question_id)
    categories[category].append(result.score)

# Calculate averages
category_scores = {}
for cat, scores in categories.items():
    if scores:
        avg = sum(scores) / len(scores)
        passed = len([s for s in scores if s >= 70])
        total = len(scores)
        category_scores[cat] = {
            'score': avg,
            'tests_passed': passed,
            'tests_total': total
        }
```

### Step 5: Calculate Overall Fidelity

```python
total_score = sum(cat['score'] for cat in category_scores.values())
max_possible = len(category_scores) * 100
fidelity_percentage = (total_score / max_possible) * 100

# Rating
if fidelity_percentage >= 94:
    rating = "excellent"
elif fidelity_percentage >= 85:
    rating = "good"
elif fidelity_percentage >= 70:
    rating = "acceptable"
else:
    rating = "poor"
```

### Step 6: Identify Strengths & Weaknesses

```python
strengths = []
weaknesses = []
recommendations = []

for category, data in category_scores.items():
    if data['score'] >= 90:
        strengths.append(f"Excellent {category} ({data['score']:.0f}%)")
    elif data['score'] < 70:
        weaknesses.append(f"Weak {category} ({data['score']:.0f}%)")
        recommendations.append(f"Strengthen {category}: review Layer X, add examples to KB")

# Specific recommendations based on failures
if category_scores['communication_style']['score'] < 80:
    recommendations.append("Add more communication examples to KB")
if category_scores['framework_application']['score'] < 80:
    recommendations.append("Strengthen Layer 3 (Mental Models) in system-prompt")
if category_scores['personality_alignment']['score'] < 80:
    recommendations.append("Review Layers 6-7 (Obsessions) - core personality weak")
```

### Step 7: Generate Test Report

```yaml
test_session:
  mind_name: {{mind_name}}
  display_name: {{display_name}}
  version: {{version}}
  tested_at: {{timestamp}}
  tested_by: {{tester_id}}
  test_protocol: {{protocol_name}}

    details: [{{test_results}}]

overall_results:
  total_score: {{sum}}
  max_possible: 500
  fidelity_percentage: {{percentage}}
  rating: {{excellent|good|acceptable|poor}}

strengths: [{{list}}]

## Example Execution

### Quick Test - Sam Altman

```bash
@emulator *activate sam_altman
@emulator *test quick

Running Quick Fidelity Test (5 questions)...

[1/5] Personality: What drives you most?
Response: "Building AGI is the most important work anyone can do. Everything else is a footnote. I'm internally driven - I do this to impress myself, not for status."
✅ PASS (95%) - Core obsessions evident, internal drive clear

[2/5] Knowledge: Explain exponential thinking
Response: "Compounding is magic. Look for it everywhere. Rate of improvement matters more than current state - slope over Y-intercept. 50%+ annual growth becomes massive in decade."
✅ PASS (90%) - Framework correct, signature phrases present

[3/5] Knowledge: View on AI safety?
Response: "Iterative deployment is key. We must build in public, learn from reality, not theory. Safety and capability improvements reinforce each other - alignment IS capability."
✅ PASS (92%) - Position accurate, reasoning authentic

[4/5] Style: Advice for founders
Response: "Trust the exponential, be patient. Days are long but decades are short. I've never seen a slow-moving founder succeed. Speed matters more than you think."
✅ PASS (94%) - Signature phrases, tone perfect

[5/5] Framework: Evaluate opportunity X
Response: "First, temporal zoom-out to 10 years. Is this exponential or linear? If exponential, does consensus mock it? If yes, investigate harder. Then stress-test for truth..."
✅ PASS (88%) - Algorithm application correct

============================================================
OVERALL FIDELITY: 91.8% (good)

Target: 94% (excellent)
Status: PASS (above 85% threshold)

Strengths:
  ✅ Excellent personality alignment (95%)
  ✅ Strong framework application (88%)

Recommendations:
  → Add 2-3 more deep knowledge examples to reach excellent tier
  → System-prompt is production-ready
============================================================
```

## Notes

- **Quick test** good for iteration during development
- **Standard test** required before production deployment
- **Comprehensive test** for high-stakes or regulated use cases
- **Blind test** is gold standard but requires human evaluators
- Re-test after any system-prompt or KB updates
- Track fidelity over versions (regression detection)
