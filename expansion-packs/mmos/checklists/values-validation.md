# Values Hierarchy Validation Checklist (Layer 6)
**Agent:** identity-analyst
**Task:** values-hierarchy-analysis
**Version:** 3.5.0
**Layer:** 6 - Values Hierarchy (DNA Mental™)

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTICE

**Layer 6 is IDENTITY-CRITICAL**

Errors here cascade through:
- Layer 7 (Core Obsessions) - driven by values
- Layer 8 (Productive Paradoxes) - emerge from value conflicts
- System Prompt - entire clone authenticity

**MANDATORY:** Human validation required after passing this checklist.

---

## Section 1: Evidence Quality ✅

### 1.1 Golden Rule Compliance
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Every value has MINIMUM 3 independent evidences
- [ ] No value accepted with <3 evidences (discard as anomaly)
- [ ] Evidences span different time periods (not all from same year)
- [ ] Evidences from different source types (mix of interviews/documents/behaviors)

### 1.2 Sacrifice-Based Validation
For each value, verify sacrificial decisions documented:
- [ ] Evidence shows what they GAVE UP (sacrifice)
- [ ] Evidence shows what they PROTECTED (preservation)
- [ ] Opportunity cost quantified ($$$, time, relationships)
- [ ] Actual consequences documented (what they paid)
- [ ] Quote or behavior captured (not inference)

❌ **Reject if:** Proclaimed values without sacrificial evidence
✅ **Accept if:** 3+ documented "gave up X to preserve Y" decisions

### 1.3 Source Triangulation
For each value, check triangulation alignment:
- [ ] **Words:** What they SAY about this value (quotes)
- [ ] **Actions:** What they DO when tested (behaviors)
- [ ] **Consequences Accepted:** What they PAY to preserve it (costs)

**Triangulation Score Formula:**
```
If Words = Actions = Consequences → Score: 1.0 (perfect)
If 2 of 3 align → Score: 0.6-0.8 (acceptable if >0.70)
If major conflicts → Score: <0.6 (investigate as Layer 8 paradox)
```

- [ ] All values have triangulation score >= 0.70
- [ ] Any score <0.70 flagged for paradox analysis (Layer 8)

---

## Section 2: Hierarchy Validity ✅

### 2.1 Ranking Criteria
- [ ] Values ranked 1-15 (minimum 10, maximum 15)
- [ ] Each value has intensity score (1-10)
- [ ] Intensity based on evidence, not inference
- [ ] Immutability categorized: never_violated / rare_exceptions / contextual

### 2.2 Intensity Validation
For top 5 values (rank 1-5):
- [ ] Intensity 8-10/10 (would die for / never violated)
- [ ] Extreme test documented (when went to limit)
- [ ] Zero or near-zero violations

For middle values (rank 6-10):
- [ ] Intensity 6-8/10 (important but contextual)
- [ ] Rare violations with guilt/justification
- [ ] Clear importance but not supreme

For lower values (rank 11-15):
- [ ] Intensity 4-6/10 (preference, not principle)
- [ ] Contextual application
- [ ] Flexible depending on situation

### 2.3 Trade-Off Consistency
- [ ] At least 5 trade-off patterns documented
- [ ] Each trade-off has 3+ supporting examples
- [ ] Pattern: "Always chooses {A} over {B}" with documented instances
- [ ] Exceptions explained (if any)
- [ ] Trade-offs align with hierarchy ranking

**Example Check:**
```
If "Autonomy" ranked #1 and "Money" ranked #8:
→ Must have trade-off: "Always chooses autonomy over money"
→ With 3+ documented decisions
```

---

## Section 3: Anti-Values Analysis ✅

### 3.1 Anti-Value Identification
- [ ] At least 3 anti-values identified (visceral rejections)
- [ ] Each anti-value has rejection intensity 7-10/10
- [ ] Physical/verbal/behavioral manifestations documented
- [ ] Not just "dislikes" but visceral rejections

### 3.2 Anti-Value Evidence
For each anti-value:
- [ ] Physical response documented (disgust, anger, withdrawal)
- [ ] Verbal patterns captured ("[X] makes me sick")
- [ ] Behavioral response observed (fight/flight/freeze)
- [ ] Specific people/groups who embody it identified

### 3.3 Cost of Rejection
- [ ] Opportunities lost documented (what sacrificed to avoid)
- [ ] Relationships lost documented (who pushed away)
- [ ] Energy spent combating quantified (hours/week or %)
- [ ] Cost acknowledged (wasted energy vs. building)

---

## Section 4: Temporal Evolution ✅

### 4.1 Life Phases Mapped
- [ ] At least 3 life phases identified
- [ ] Each phase has 3+ dominant values listed
- [ ] Intensity scores per phase documented
- [ ] Clear differentiation between phases

### 4.2 Transition Events
- [ ] Major transition events identified between phases
- [ ] Impact of each transition documented
- [ ] Values that changed vs. values that remained
- [ ] Immutable values identified (never changed)

### 4.3 Evolution Coherence
- [ ] Evolution tells coherent story
- [ ] Formative events create understandable shifts
- [ ] Current values trace back to origins
- [ ] No unexplained dramatic shifts

---

## Section 5: Template Compliance ✅

### 5.1 Structure Validation
- [ ] Output matches `values-hierarchy.yaml` template exactly
- [ ] All required fields filled (no empty critical fields)
- [ ] Valid YAML syntax (no parsing errors)
- [ ] Proper nesting and indentation

### 5.2 Metadata Completeness
- [ ] Mind name specified
- [ ] Analysis date recorded
- [ ] Sources list populated
- [ ] Observation period (years) documented
- [ ] Confidence score calculated

### 5.3 Validation Report
- [ ] Total values count accurate
- [ ] Average evidences per value >= 3.0
- [ ] Average triangulation >= 0.70
- [ ] Gaps identified and documented
- [ ] Uncertainties flagged

---

## Section 6: Critical Cross-Checks ✅

### 6.1 Internal Consistency
- [ ] No contradictory values in top 15
- [ ] Trade-offs align with hierarchy
- [ ] Anti-values opposed to core values (logical inversion)
- [ ] Temporal evolution shows coherent narrative

### 6.2 Behavioral Alignment
Cross-reference with `behavioral_patterns.yaml`:
- [ ] Values explain behavioral states
- [ ] State triggers align with value activations
- [ ] Decisions match value hierarchy predictions
- [ ] No unexplained behaviors contradicting values

### 6.3 Timeline Alignment
Cross-reference with `life_timeline.yaml`:
- [ ] Major life events mapped to value activations
- [ ] Transition events documented in timeline
- [ ] Sacrifices have timestamps in timeline
- [ ] Evolution phases match timeline periods

## Section 7: Pre-Human-Checkpoint Prep ✅

### 7.1 Validation Report Generation
- [ ] Top 15 values summarized clearly
- [ ] 3 evidences per value presented concisely
- [ ] Anti-values listed with manifestations
- [ ] Trade-offs highlighted
- [ ] Evolution map visualized

### 7.2 Human Validation Questions Prepared
- [ ] "Does this ranking feel authentic?"
- [ ] "Any values missing that should be top 5?"
- [ ] "Any values ranked too high/low?"
- [ ] "Do anti-values resonate?"
- [ ] "Does evolution narrative make sense?"

### 7.3 Decision Framework Ready
```
APPROVE: Hierarchy authentic, proceed to Layer 7
REVISE: Make adjustments (specify which values/rankings)
RE-ANALYZE: Fundamental misunderstanding, start over
```

## 🔴 MANDATORY NEXT STEP

After passing this checklist:

**→ EXECUTE HUMAN CHECKPOINT** (cannot be skipped)

Command: `*human-checkpoint`

**DO NOT proceed to Layer 7 (Obsessions) until human validates Layer 6.**

Errors in values cascade through obsessions and paradoxes.

## Validation Status

- [ ] **PASSED** - All criteria met, ready for human checkpoint
