  name: Knowledge Base Creation & Specialist Recommendations
  description: >-
    Creates RAG-optimized knowledge base chunks from all analysis artifacts and
    recommends specialist clone variations based on cognitive architecture analysis.
    Prepares the foundation for implementation phase.

  - agent: analyst
    phase: synthesis
    creates: knowledge-base
    task: knowledge-base-chunking
    prerequisites:
      - All analysis artifacts complete
    outputs:

      Create optimized knowledge base chunks:

      CHUNKING STRATEGY:
      - 500-1000 words per chunk
      - Thematic grouping
      - Semantic coherence
      - RAG-optimized

      FLAT STRUCTURE:
      outputs/minds/{slug}/kb/
        ├── chunk_001.md
        ├── chunk_002.md
        └── chunk_NNN.md

      (No subdirectories - flat for RAG efficiency)

      OUTPUT: Complete knowledge base ready for RAG or fine-tuning

    creates: specialist-recommendations
    task: specialist-recommendation
    prerequisites:
      - Cognitive architecture complete
    outputs:
      - outputs/minds/{slug}/docs/logs/{timestamp}-specialist_recommendations.yaml
    notes: |
      Analyze cognitive architecture to recommend specialist variations:

      SPECIALIST TYPES:
      - "{Mind} as Business Coach"
      - "{Mind} as Writer's Mentor"
      - "{Mind} as Strategic Advisor"
      - "{Mind} as [Domain] Expert"

      For each specialist:
      - Recommended specialization
      - Required knowledge augmentation
      - Prompt engineering strategy
      - Use cases

      OUTPUT: Specialist recommendations for future development
