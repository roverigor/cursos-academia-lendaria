  description: >-
    Observable patterns and mental models that form the foundation of cognitive analysis.
    These layers extract behavioral patterns, communication style, routines, recognition
    patterns, and mental models without requiring human validation checkpoints.

      DNA Mental™ LAYERS 1-4: Observable Patterns (Foundation)

      Execute in PARALLEL (4 concurrent analyses):

      LAYER 1: Behavioral Patterns
      - Observable actions and decisions
      - Recurring behavior patterns
      - Response to situations

      LAYER 2: Communication Style
      - Linguistic patterns and vocabulary
      - Signature phrases and metaphors
      - Writing/speaking style forensics

      LAYER 3: Routine & Habits
      - Temporal patterns
      - Daily/weekly/monthly routines
      - Work habits and rituals

      LAYER 4: Recognition Patterns (Mental Radars)
      - What they notice (and ignore)
      - Pattern recognition capabilities
      - Filters and attention mechanisms

      No human checkpoint required - foundational observables.

      OUTPUT: 4 artifact files documenting observable patterns

      DNA Mental™ LAYER 5: Mental Models & Frameworks

      Extract thinking frameworks:
      - How they interpret reality
      - Frameworks they apply to problems
      - Conceptual models they use
      - Reasoning patterns

      TRIANGULATION REQUIRED:
      - Cross-reference against Layers 1-4
      - Validate consistency across sources
      - Document evidence trail

      OUTPUT: Mental models catalog
