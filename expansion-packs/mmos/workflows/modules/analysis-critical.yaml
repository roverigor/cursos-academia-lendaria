  name: DNA Mental™ Critical Layers (6-8) + Checkpoints
  description: >-
    Critical analysis layers that define core identity and require human validation.
    These layers extract values hierarchy, core obsessions, and productive paradoxes
    - the elements that make cognitive clones feel authentically human rather than
    robotic. Each layer includes mandatory human checkpoints before proceeding.

    THIS IS THE DIFFERENTIATOR - what makes clones feel human vs uncanny valley.
    Do not skip checkpoints. Layer 8 especially is THE GOLD LAYER.

      DNA Mental™ LAYER 6: Values Hierarchy (CRITICAL)

      Extract ranked core values:
      - What they prioritize above all
      - Demonstrated vs stated values
      - Value trade-offs and conflicts
      - Non-negotiables

      TRIANGULATION REQUIRED:
      - Stated values vs demonstrated behavior
      - Cross-source agreement analysis
      - Temporal consistency check

      HUMAN CHECKPOINT #2: Layer 6 Validation

      Present values hierarchy to user:
      - Ranked values with evidence
      - Source citations and examples
      - Triangulation status (agreement %)
      - Confidence level

      User decision:
      1. APPROVE - Proceed to Layer 7
      2. REVISE - Provide corrections/additions
      3. RE-ANALYZE - Deeper extraction needed

      VALUES ARE CRITICAL FOR CLONE AUTHENTICITY.
      Do not proceed without validation.

  # ============================================================================
  # LAYER 7: Core Obsessions (Driving Forces)
  # ============================================================================
  - agent: analyst
    phase: analysis
    creates: cognitive-analysis-layer-7
    task: cognitive-analysis
    task_mode: layer_7
    prerequisites:
      - Layer 6 approved
    outputs:

      DNA Mental™ LAYER 7: Core Obsessions (Driving Forces)

      Identify 2-3 core obsessions:
      - What topics appear obsessively
      - What questions drive their work
      - What problems consume attention
      - Recurring themes across all contexts

      TRIANGULATION REQUIRED:
      - Cross-temporal validation
      - Multi-source confirmation
      - Intensity and consistency analysis

      HUMAN CHECKPOINT #3: Layer 7 Validation

      Present core obsessions with:
      - Obsession description
      - Evidence from sources
      - Intensity metrics
      - Historical consistency

      User decision:
      1. APPROVE - Proceed to Layer 8
      2. REVISE - Adjust obsessions
      3. RE-ANALYZE - Need deeper extraction

      OBSESSIONS ARE THE MOTORS OF PERSONALITY.

  # ============================================================================
  # LAYER 8: Productive Paradoxes (THE GOLD LAYER)

  - agent: analyst
    phase: analysis
    creates: cognitive-analysis-layer-8
    task: cognitive-analysis
    task_mode: layer_8
    prerequisites:
      - Layer 7 approved

      DNA Mental™ LAYER 8: Productive Paradoxes (THE GOLD LAYER)

      Identify productive contradictions:
      - Simultaneous opposing beliefs
      - Context-dependent positions
      - Nuanced complexity
      - "Both/and" thinking patterns

      WHY LAYER 8 MATTERS:
      This is what makes AI clones feel genuinely HUMAN.
      - Prevents robotic consistency
      - Enables contextual wisdom
      - Creates authentic personality depth

      Without Layer 8, clones feel "uncanny valley."

      HUMAN CHECKPOINT #4: Layer 8 Validation

      Present each paradox:
      - Contradiction description ("Belief A" AND "Belief B")
      - Context where each applies
      - How they coexist
      - Evidence from sources

      User decision:
      1. APPROVE - Proceed to synthesis
      2. REVISE - Adjust or add paradoxes
      3. RE-ANALYZE - Deeper paradox extraction

      THIS IS THE DIFFERENTIATOR BETWEEN GOOD AND GREAT CLONES.

  # SYNTHESIS: Cognitive Architecture
  # ============================================================================
  - agent: architect
    phase: analysis
    creates: cognitive-architecture
    task: cognitive-analysis
    task_mode: architecture
    prerequisites:
      - All 8 layers complete and validated
    outputs:
      - outputs/minds/{slug}/artifacts/cognitive_architecture.yaml
      - outputs/minds/{slug}/docs/LIMITATIONS.md
    notes: |
      Synthesize all 8 layers into unified cognitive architecture.

      ARCHITECTURE SYNTHESIS:
      - Integration of all layers
      - Cross-layer dependencies
      - Interaction patterns
      - System dynamics

      Generate LIMITATIONS.md:
      - Known gaps in knowledge
      - Topics outside expertise
      - Temporal boundaries (knowledge cutoff)
      - Contextual constraints

      OUTPUT: Complete cognitive architecture (3000+ words)
