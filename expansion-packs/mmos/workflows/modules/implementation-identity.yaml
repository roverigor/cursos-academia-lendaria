  name: Identity Core Extraction
  description: >-
    Distills all cognitive analysis and synthesis into absolute essence - the
    identity primitives that define who the person is, what drives them, how they
    think, and why they matter. This becomes the foundation of the system prompt.

      Distill absolute essence into identity primitives:

      IDENTITY CORE:
      - Who they are (essence)
      - What drives them (motors)
      - How they think (cognition)
      - Why they matter (unique value)

      This becomes the foundation of the system prompt.

      OUTPUT: Identity core YAML
