# Story 1.3: Modify Schema Workflow

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to safely apply database schema changes with automated backups and verification,
**so that** I can evolve my schema confidently without data loss or downtime risks

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can create new migrations or apply existing ones
2. Pre-migration snapshot created automatically
3. Migration DDL order validated before execution
4. Dry-run option tests migration safety
5. Advisory lock prevents concurrent migrations
6. Post-migration smoke test validates schema integrity
7. Rollback instructions provided if migration fails

### Key Context from Research

**Industry Pattern (Supabase/PostgreSQL 2024):**
- Multi-environment: local → staging → prod (never skip environments)
- Always test migrations in dry-run mode first
- Create snapshots before any schema change
- Run smoke tests after migration
- Automate via CI/CD (not manual)

**From db-workflows-research-2024.md (Migration Workflow):**

**Method A: Maintenance Window (Full Control)**
- Set source to read-only
- Create snapshot (pg_dump)
- Apply migrations
- Smoke test
- Cutover
- Duration: 15-60 minutes downtime

**Method B: Blue/Green (Zero Downtime)**
- Create blue environment (clone)
- Apply migrations to blue
- Set up logical replication
- Validate blue
- Switch traffic (DNS/load balancer)
- Keep green as rollback (24-48h)
- Duration: 0 downtime

**Rollback Strategies:**
1. Transaction Rollback (within session) → SAVEPOINT
2. Point-in-Time Recovery (hours/days back) → WAL replay
3. Blue/Green Failback (instant) → DNS switch

### Integration with Existing Tasks

**db-verify-order.md** (DDL ordering validation):
- Extracts DDL sections by type
- Compares recommended vs actual order
- Detects common issues: functions before tables, RLS before tables
- Provides fix recommendations
- Fast heuristic check (no database connection needed)

**db-snapshot.md** (Pre/post snapshots):
- Schema-only dump (fast, small)
- Labeled snapshots (e.g., `pre_migration_20241027`)
- Saved to `supabase/snapshots/`
- Includes metadata file with purpose and restore instructions
- Retention: 7 days (all), 30 days (daily), 1 year (monthly)

**db-apply-migration.md** (Migration execution):
- Advisory lock prevents concurrent migrations
- ON_ERROR_STOP=1 stops on first error
- Pre/post snapshots automatic
- Diff generation (before vs after)
- Post-migration actions: smoke test, RLS audit, performance check

**db-smoke-test.md** (Comprehensive validation):
- Section 1: Schema structure (tables, constraints, indexes)
- Section 2: RLS policies (enabled, coverage)
- Section 3: Functions & triggers
- Section 4: Views
- Section 5: RLS functional tests (with impersonation)
- Section 6: Data integrity (orphaned records check)

        cat > "$FILE" << 'EOF'
        -- Migration: {description}
        -- Created: $(date -u)

        BEGIN;

        -- 1. Extensions
        -- CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";

        -- 2. Tables
        -- CREATE TABLE ...

        echo "2. Manual rollback: Create rollback script"
        echo ""
        echo "Emergency snapshot: {{pre_snapshot_file}}"
```

### Safety Features

**Advisory Lock (Prevent Concurrent Migrations):**
```bash
psql "$DB_URL" -c \
  "SELECT pg_try_advisory_lock(hashtext('dbsage:migrate')) AS got" \
  | grep -q t || { echo "❌ Another migration is running"; exit 1; }
```

**DDL Ordering (Prevent Dependency Errors):**
```
Recommended Order:
1. Extensions (CREATE EXTENSION)
2. Tables & Constraints (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE)
3. Functions (CREATE FUNCTION)
4. Triggers (CREATE TRIGGER)
5. RLS (ENABLE RLS, CREATE POLICY)
6. Views & Materialized Views (CREATE VIEW)
```

**Dry-Run (Test Without Applying):**
```bash
psql "$DB_URL" << 'EOF'
BEGIN;
\i migration.sql
ROLLBACK;  -- Undo all changes
EOF
```

**Snapshot Before/After:**
```bash
# Before
pg_dump "$DB_URL" --schema-only > snapshots/before.sql

# Apply migration
psql "$DB_URL" -f migration.sql

# After
pg_dump "$DB_URL" --schema-only > snapshots/after.sql

# Diff
diff -u snapshots/before.sql snapshots/after.sql > snapshots/diff.patch
```

### Error Handling

**Common Migration Errors:**
```
❌ ERROR: relation "table_name" already exists
   → Table already created in previous migration
   → Use: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS
   → Or check migration wasn't applied twice

❌ ERROR: function "func_name" does not exist
   → Functions must be created before triggers that call them
   → Check DDL ordering: functions before triggers

❌ ERROR: cannot create policy on table without RLS
   → Enable RLS before creating policies
   → ALTER TABLE table_name ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

❌ ERROR: column "column_name" does not exist
   → Check column spelling (case-sensitive)
   → Ensure column created in same or prior migration
```

### Rollback Decision Matrix

| Situation | Action | Command |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Migration failed mid-way | PostgreSQL rolled back | No action needed (transaction) |
| Schema breaks app | Restore snapshot | `*rollback snapshot_before.sql` |
| Wrong migration applied | Restore snapshot | `*rollback snapshot_before.sql` |
| Minor bug in function | Forward fix | Create fix migration |
| Data corruption risk | Forward fix | Don't rollback schema |

### Testing Standards

**Test Location**: `expansion-packs/super-agentes/tests/workflows/`
**Test File**: `modify-schema-workflow.test.js`

**Test Coverage:**
1. New migration creation with proper template
2. Existing migration application
3. DDL order validation (pass and fail)
4. Dry-run detects syntax errors
5. Pre/post snapshots created
6. Advisory lock prevents concurrent runs
7. Smoke test validates schema
8. Rollback instructions on failure
9. Error handling: syntax error, constraint violation, FK violation

**Mock Requirements:**
- Mock file system (migration files, snapshots)
- Mock psql execution
- Mock pg_dump for snapshots
- Mock advisory lock acquisition
- Mock smoke test execution

### Next Steps After Completion
1. User runs: `*migrate`
2. Selects migration (new or existing)
3. DDL order validated
4. Dry-run tests migration (optional but recommended)
5. Pre-migration snapshot created
6. Migration applied with lock
7. Smoke test validates schema
8. Success message or rollback instructions

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Story Quality Assessment

**Status**: Draft (Pre-Implementation Review)

This story demonstrates outstanding migration safety design and is ready for implementation with one minor clarification needed. Key strengths:
- Comprehensive safety layers (DDL validation, dry-run, snapshots, smoke tests, rollback)
- Advisory lock prevents concurrent migrations (critical for multi-developer teams)
- Excellent research integration (Supabase/PostgreSQL 2024 best practices)
- Rollback decision matrix and error handling examples
- Well-integrated with existing tasks (db-verify-order, db-snapshot, db-apply-migration, db-smoke-test)

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ N/A (Draft story, no code yet)
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows expansion-packs structure
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test scenarios including rollback
- All ACs Testable: ✓ Each AC mapped to test scenarios

### Testability Assessment

**Given-When-Then Mapping**:
- **Given**: User has migration file (new or existing)
- **When**: User runs `*migrate` workflow
- **Then**: Migration applied safely with snapshots, validation, and smoke tests

**Test Coverage**: 14 scenarios documented
- 2 happy paths (new migration creation, existing migration application)
- 6 safety checks (DDL validation, dry-run, snapshots, lock, smoke test, rollback)
- 6 error scenarios (syntax error, ordering issues, constraint violations, concurrent execution)

### Minor Concern

**REQ-001** (Low severity):
- Story references `db-dry-run.md` task marked as "(to be implemented)"
- **Suggested Action**: Either create stub task or document inline BEGIN...ROLLBACK approach before implementation
- **Impact**: Low - Inline approach is straightforward, task is a nice-to-have abstraction

### Security Review

✓ **PASS** - Security design is excellent:
- Advisory lock prevents concurrent migrations (data integrity)
- Pre-migration snapshots for rollback safety
- DDL order validation prevents dependency errors
- Post-migration smoke test catches issues early

### Performance Considerations

✓ **PASS** - Performance design is appropriate:
- DDL order validation is fast (heuristic, no DB connection)
- Schema-only snapshots are fast (~1MB, seconds)
- Advisory lock has minimal overhead

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security**: ✓ PASS (advisory lock, snapshots, validation)
- **Performance**: ✓ PASS (DDL validation prevents errors)
- **Reliability**: ✓ PASS (comprehensive safety: validation, dry-run, snapshots, smoke tests)
- **Maintainability**: ✓ PASS (rollback decision matrix, extensive error handling examples)

### Recommendations

**Immediate**:
- [ ] Create `db-dry-run.md` stub task or document inline approach in Dev Notes

**Future Enhancements** (non-blocking):
- Consider migration history/audit log
- Consider migration version tracking in database table

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.3-modify-schema-workflow.yml
(Minor concern about missing db-dry-run.md task)

### Recommended Status

✓ **Ready for Implementation** (after addressing db-dry-run.md clarification)
(Story owner decides final status)
