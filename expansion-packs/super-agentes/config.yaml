name: super-agentes
version: 2.0.0
short-title: SuperAgentes Pack
description: >-
  SuperAgentes is a meta-orchestrator expansion pack that provides unified access
  to specialized database and design system capabilities. It consolidates DB Sage
  (database architecture & operations) and Design System (Brad Frost methodology -
  complete UI audit, pattern consolidation, and component generation) into a single,
  seamless interface with intelligent command routing.

    status: production

capabilities:
  database:
    - Schema design and domain modeling
    - Safe migrations with snapshots and rollback
    - RLS security policies and audits
    - Query performance optimization
    - Supabase setup and operations
    - SQL execution and CSV import

  design_system:
    - Brownfield UI pattern audit (buttons, colors, forms, spacing, typography)
    - Pattern redundancy detection and consolidation (HSL clustering, semantic analysis)
    - Design token extraction and generation (semantic naming)
    - Multi-format token export (JSON, CSS, Tailwind, SCSS)
    - ROI calculation and cost savings analysis (pattern-weighted costs)
    - Shock report generation with visual evidence (HTML reports)
    - Phased migration strategy planning (4-phase rollout)
    - Production-ready component generation (React/TypeScript)
    - Atomic Design composition (atoms → molecules → organisms)
    - WCAG AA/AAA accessibility compliance
    - Unit test and documentation generation (Jest, Storybook)
    - Pattern library building
    - Expansion pack integration (MMOS, CreatorOS, InnerLens)

command_routing:
  prefixes:
    db: Routes to DB Sage context
    ds: Routes to Design System (Brad) context

      - "*ds:audit ./src - Audit UI patterns for redundancy"
      - "*ds:consolidate - Reduce pattern redundancy using clustering"
      - "*ds:tokenize - Generate design tokens from patterns"
      - "*ds:migrate - Create phased migration strategy"
      - "*ds:shock-report - Generate visual HTML shock report"
      - "*ds:calculate-roi - Calculate cost savings and ROI"
      - "*ds:setup - Initialize greenfield design system"
      - "*ds:build button - Generate production-ready Button component"
      - "*ds:compose form-field - Compose molecule from atoms"
      - "*ds:document - Generate pattern library documentation"
      - "*ds:integrate mmos - Integrate with MMOS expansion pack"

notes: |
  SuperAgentes follows the AIOS Orchestrator pattern, providing both:
  1. Agent transformation: `*agent {name}` for extended work in one context
  2. Prefix routing: `*{prefix}:{command}` for quick single-command execution

  AGENTS:
  - DB Sage: Production-ready database architecture (20 tasks, 12 templates)
  - Design System (Brad Frost): Complete design system workflow with 12 commands
    * Brownfield: audit → consolidate → tokenize → migrate → build → compose
    * Greenfield: setup → build → compose → document
    * Audit-only: audit → shock-report → calculate-roi

  WORKFLOWS (3 YAML workflows):
  - brownfield-complete.yaml: Audit existing UI chaos through component building (70% of use cases)
  - greenfield-new.yaml: Start fresh with token-based components (20% of use cases)
  - audit-only.yaml: Generate shock reports and ROI for stakeholders (10% of use cases)

  PHILOSOPHY:
  - Brad Frost methodology: "Show the horror, then fix it"
  - Metric-driven decisions (47 buttons → 3 = 93.6% reduction)
  - Visual shock therapy for stakeholder action
  - ROI-focused with real cost calculations
  - Zero hardcoded values (all styling from tokens)

  INTEGRATION:
  - Design System generates UI patterns for MMOS cognitive clones
  - Design System generates course UIs for CreatorOS
  - Design System generates assessment forms for InnerLens

status:
  version: 2.0.0
  db_sage: Production Ready (v1.1.0)
  design_system: Production Ready (v2.0.0 - Brad unified)
  overall: Fully functional with 3 production agents
