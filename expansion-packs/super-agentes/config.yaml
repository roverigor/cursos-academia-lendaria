name: super-agentes
version: 1.0.0
short-title: SuperAgentes Pack
description: >-
  SuperAgentes is a meta-orchestrator expansion pack that provides unified access
  to specialized database and design system capabilities. It consolidates DB Sage
  (database architecture & operations) and Design System (design pattern management)
  into a single, seamless interface with intelligent command routing.

capabilities:
  database:
    - Schema design and domain modeling
    - Safe migrations with snapshots and rollback
    - RLS security policies and audits
    - Query performance optimization
    - Supabase setup and operations
    - SQL execution and CSV import

  design_system:
    - Design pattern scanning (future)
    - Component generation (future)
    - Design system documentation (future)
    - Design token management (future)
    - Style consistency validation (future)

command_routing:
  prefixes:
    db: Routes to DB Sage context
    ds: Routes to Design System context

  examples:
    - "*db:create-schema - Design database schema"
    - "*db:apply-migration - Run migration with snapshot"
    - "*db:rls-audit - Audit RLS coverage"
    - "*ds:help - Show design system commands (placeholder)"

resources:
  tasks: 23 tasks (20 database + 3 AIOS core shared tasks)
  templates: 12 database templates
  checklists: 3 database quality checklists
  data: 5 knowledge base documents
  examples: Task execution examples
  docs: Implementation guides and schema comparisons

integration:
  type: Orchestrator
  pattern: Meta-agent with prefix routing
  agents_included: 2
  agents_complete: 1
  agents_placeholder: 1

requires:
  aios-version: ">=4.0.0"

tools:
  - supabase-cli
  - psql
  - pg_dump
  - postgres-explain-analyzer

notes: |
  SuperAgentes follows the AIOS Orchestrator pattern, providing both:
  1. Agent transformation: `*agent db-sage` for extended work in one context
  2. Prefix routing: `*db:comando` for quick single-command execution

  The design-system agent is currently a placeholder and will be developed
  in future releases. DB Sage is fully functional with 20+ production-ready
  database tasks and templates.

status:
  db-sage: Production Ready (v1.1.0)
  design-system: Placeholder
  overall: Functional with one complete agent
