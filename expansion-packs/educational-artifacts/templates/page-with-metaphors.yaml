## Page Template with Metaphor-Driven Design - José Amorim Method
## Heavy visual metaphor integration as PRIMARY teaching mechanism

template:
  id: page-with-metaphors
  name: "Educational Page with Metaphor-Driven Design"
  version: "1.0"
  author: "Alan Nicolas"
  description: |
    Template optimized for metaphor-driven learning where visual and conceptual
    metaphors are the PRIMARY teaching mechanism. Perfect for abstract concepts
    that need grounding in the concrete and familiar.

## Page Structure
structure:
  type: "metaphor-interactive-page"
  framework: "responsive-web"
  components:
    - hero-with-central-metaphor
    - visual-metaphor-explorer
    - metaphor-to-concept-mapping
    - metaphor-progression-journey
    - visual-storytelling-narrative
    - metaphor-application-challenge

## Quick Summary
This template makes metaphors the HEART of the learning experience. Rather than
using metaphors as decorative illustrations, metaphors become the tool for
understanding. Learners explore the metaphor, map it to concepts, and use it
to solve problems.

## Key Features
- Central metaphor as teaching tool (not decoration)
- Interactive metaphor exploration with visual mapping
- Metaphor-to-concept explicit connections
- Visual narrative journey through metaphor
- Real-world problem solving using metaphor
- Progressive deepening through metaphor layers

## Usage
Use this template when:
- Concept is highly abstract
- Strong metaphor exists (familiar, accurate, complete)
- Visual metaphor can be primary teaching tool
- Learners benefit from metaphor-based reasoning
- Concept benefits from concrete analog
- Multiple layers of complexity benefit from metaphor progression

## Pedagogical Power
Metaphors work because they:
1. Ground abstract in concrete/familiar
2. Leverage existing knowledge structures
3. Enable transfer of understanding
4. Create visual-spatial understanding
5. Make complex seem simple without losing depth

## Designer Notes
- Metaphor must be FAMILIAR to target audience
- Mapping must be ACCURATE (no misleading associations)
- Metaphor must be COMPLETE (covers key aspects)
- Progression should go: understand metaphor → map to concept → apply to solve
- Always include textual alternative to visuals for accessibility
