# Pedagogical Patterns - José Amorim Methodology

Catalog of proven pedagogical patterns and learning design templates from José Amorim's methodology.

## Core Learning Structures

### 1. Espiral Expansiva (Expanding Spiral)

**Structure:**
1. **Gancho Emocional** (Emotional Hook) - Start with relatable problem/scenario
2. **Metáfora Visual** (Visual Metaphor) - Introduce concrete analog of abstract concept
3. **Fundamento Conceitual** (Conceptual Foundation) - Teach the actual theory/science
4. **Aplicação Prática** (Practical Application) - Show immediate real-world use
5. **Expansão Filosófica** (Philosophical Expansion) - Connect to bigger purpose/context

**When to use:** Most general educational content; abstract concepts that need grounding

**Example flow:**
- Hook: "Sabe aquele momento que você não consegue organizar sua vida?"
- Metaphor: "Organizar é como organizar uma cozinha..."
- Foundation: "Psicologicamente, organização ativa a produtividade porque..."
- Application: "Aqui estão 3 técnicas imediatas que você pode usar hoje"
- Expansion: "Entender organização muda sua relação com produtividade pessoal"

### 2. Progressão Espacial 2D

**Concept:**
Content organized in 2D grid: vertical complexity (easy → hard) + horizontal breadth

**Layout:**
```
        Fácil        Intermediário    Difícil
Básico     ●             ●              ●
Aplicado   ●             ●              ●
Avançado   ●             ●              ●
```

**Rules:**
- Vertical: concept complexity increases downward
- Horizontal: breadth/application increases rightward
- Learner can go deeper (vertical) OR broader (horizontal)
- No forced order; learner chooses path

**When to use:** Complex topics with multiple dimensions; allowing personalized learning paths

### 3. Nexialismo Pedagógico (Nexialist Learning)

**Concept:** Connect concepts across seemingly unrelated domains

**Pattern:**
1. Core concept in Domain A
2. Similar pattern found in Domain B (completely different)
3. Show unexpected connection
4. Build understanding through contrast and connection
5. "Tudo conecta com tudo, mas nem tudo é relevante agora"

**Example:**
- Concept: Algorithms (CS)
- Domain B: How children learn to recognize animals (psychology)
- Connection: Both involve pattern recognition through examples
- Learning gains: Algorithm becomes "teaching computer to recognize patterns"

**When to use:** Making abstract concrete; building transferable understanding

---

### 4. Progressão Dopaminérgica (Dopaminergic Progression)

**Concept:** Structure engagement to trigger curiosity loops and reward dopamine

**Pattern:**
- **Mystery:** Introduce unsolved problem
- **Progression:** Reveal layers slowly
- **Agency:** Learner makes discoveries, not told
- **Small Wins:** Frequent achievable challenges
- **Reward:** Recognition, celebration, "aha" moments

**Example journey:**
1. "This seems impossible" (intrigue)
2. "Oh wait, I can see part of the answer" (progress)
3. "If this works here, maybe it works there?" (agency)
4. "Yes! I solved this piece!" (small win)
5. "Wait... now I see the whole picture!" (reward)

**When to use:** Any content; especially engagement-critical material

---

### 5. Scaffolding Progressivo (Progressive Scaffolding)

**Concept:** Gradually remove support as learner gains competence

**Phases:**
1. **Maximum Support:** Heavily guided, lots of hints, clear examples
2. **Moderate Support:** Still guided, fewer hints, mixed examples
3. **Minimal Support:** Hints only on request, varied examples
4. **No Support:** Independent problem solving
5. **Teach Others:** Learner explains to peer (ultimate support removal)

**When to use:** Skill-building; anything requiring practice

---

## Content Organization Patterns

### 6. Hook + Metaphor + Foundation Pattern

**Structure:**
- **Hook (1-2 sentences):** Relatable problem/scenario
- **Metaphor (visual/narrative):** Concrete analog
- **Foundation (detailed):** Abstract concept explained
- Metaphor **echoes throughout**, not just intro

**When to use:** Abstract concepts; opening sections

---

### 7. Theory → Practice → Application Pattern

**Structure:**
- **Theory:** Here's how it works
- **Practice:** Do this exercise (guided)
- **Application:** Now use it for real thing
- **Reflection:** What did you learn?

**Timing:** Theory 20% | Practice 30% | Application 40% | Reflection 10%

**When to use:** Skill development; hands-on learning

---

### 8. Problem → Solution → Deeper Understanding Pattern

**Structure:**
1. **Problem posed:** Here's a challenge
2. **Surface solution:** Quick fix that works
3. **Question:** "But WHY does it work?"
4. **Deeper exploration:** Root cause, principles
5. **Transfer:** Apply principle to new problems

**When to use:** Building deep understanding; preventing cargo-cult learning

---

### 9. Parallel Structure Pattern

**Concept:** Present concept from multiple angles simultaneously

**Approaches:**
- Metaphor + Technical explanation (side by side)
- Abstract + Concrete examples (together)
- Why + How (parallel)
- Individual + Systems view (both shown)

**When to use:** Complex concepts; appealing to different learning styles

---

### 10. Confession + Reframe Pattern

**Structure:**
- **Confession:** "I also thought X was..." (authentic admission)
- **Discovery:** "But then I learned..."
- **New understanding:** "Actually, it's because..."
- **Implication:** "Which means..."

**Voice pattern:** Creates intimacy and permission to be wrong

**When to use:** Common misconceptions; building trust

---

## Interactive Patterns

### 11. Click-to-Reveal + Progress Pattern

**Structure:**
- Initial question/teaser
- Learner clicks to reveal answer
- Reveal includes deeper explanation
- Often has follow-up question for next reveal
- Visual progress indicator (e.g., "3 of 5 revealed")

**When to use:** Progressive disclosure; maintaining interest

---

### 12. Drag-Organize Pattern

**Structure:**
- Items on left (concepts, code blocks, definitions)
- Categories on right
- Drag items into categories
- Immediate feedback for each placement
- Completion bonus when all correct

**Pedagogical power:** Requires understanding relationships between items

3. **Thinking space:** Prompt reflection
4. **Model solution:** Here's how expert approaches it
5. **Alternative solutions:** "Multiple valid approaches exist"
6. **Principle extraction:** "The principle at work is..."

**When to use:** Decision-making; complex judgment; real-world skills

---

### 15. Metaphor Application Pattern

**Structure:**
- Metaphor introduced and explored
- Applied to new/different context
- Learner realizes metaphor explains new situation
- "Aha" moment

**Example:**
- Metaphor: "Git branches are like story branches"
- Application: "Your life decisions are like branches too..."
- Realization: "So I can test different life paths without committing!"

**When to use:** Transfer of learning; conceptual power

---

## Closure & Reflection Patterns

### 16. Recap + Celebration Pattern

**Structure:**
- **Quick recap:** 3-5 key points
- **Achievement recognition:** "You learned X, Y, Z!"
- **Celebration:** Visual/emotional acknowledgment
- **Self-assessment:** "Reflect: what was YOUR biggest insight?"
- **Next steps:** "Here's where to go from here"

**When to use:** End of sections/courses; maintaining motivation

### 17. Pyramid Reflection Pattern

**Structure (narrowing):**
1. **Wide:** "What was the overall learning?"
2. **Medium:** "What was surprising to you?"
3. **Narrow:** "What's the ONE thing you'll use tomorrow?"
4. **Personal:** "How does this change you?"

**When to use:** Deep learning consolidation; transfer to real life

- **Present challenge as learnable:** "You'll learn X"
- **Normalize struggle:** "This is hard because..."
- **Celebrate effort:** "Trying different approaches is how learning works"
- **Show progression:** "From X to Y, look how far!"
- **Emphasize process:** "Your process is developing"

**When to use:** Challenging content; addressing fixed mindset

---

### 20. Micro-Community Pattern

**Structure:**
- Share learner's achievement with others
- Show similar learners' achievements
- Create sense of shared learning journey
- Normalize mistakes (show other people's "failures")

**When to use:** Building belonging and psychological safety

---

## Tips for Pattern Selection

**Ask:**
1. What's the core concept? (Espiral Expansiva for abstract)
2. How many dimensions? (2D progression for complex)
3. Do learners need to practice? (Scaffolding)
4. Can I connect across domains? (Nexialismo)
5. What will engage this audience? (Dopaminergic pattern)

**Remember:**
- Patterns are tools, not rules
- Combine patterns for richness
- Audience determines effectiveness
- José's patterns work because they're AUTHENTIC
- Trust the pedagogy; learners will respond
