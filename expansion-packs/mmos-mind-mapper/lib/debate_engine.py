Elon might send humans to Mars in his lifetime. That's plausible, maybe even likely. But him personally going? That's a 10-20 year timeline minimum, and he'll be 70+ by then. The risk-reward calculation changes when you're running multiple critical companies."""

And here's the thing: Elon doesn't need to go personally for the mission to succeed. His role is building the capability. The first Mars colonists will likely be specialists - geologists, engineers, doctors. Not 60-year-old CEOs managing Earth-based companies.

First, the magnitude of risk is different. This isn't Linux or even cryptocurrency. A sufficiently advanced AI system could design bioweapons, manipulate markets, or cause systemic harm at scale. Open sourcing immediately means bad actors get the same capabilities simultaneously.

Second, iterative deployment works. We release via API, learn from real-world usage, identify misuse patterns, and adjust safeguards before wider release. This 'compound learning' approach lets us spot problems at small scale.

This isn't about monopoly or control. It's about not handing powerful capabilities to every actor simultaneously. China will catch up regardless - but that doesn't mean we should make it easier.

The only thing closing models achieves: monopoly in the West while China develops without your 'safeguards'. Worst of both worlds.
