# Now converse directly with the clone
# Clone responds in Nassim's style with his frameworks

# Get advice on your project
*advice

# "I'm building a SaaS product. What's the biggest risk I'm ignoring?"
# → Clone applies Layer 8 paradoxes, Layer 7 obsessions, Layer 5 mental models

# Test the clone's fidelity
*test

# → Runs blind test questions (personality, knowledge, style)
```

---

### Example 8: Dual Clone Interaction 💬

```bash
# Activate emulator
@emulator

# Start dual interaction mode
*duo nassim_taleb naval_ravikant

# System orchestrates:
# 1. Loads both clones with their cognitive architectures
# 2. 3+ dialogue turns between both clones
# 3. They debate your project/context
# 4. Each brings their unique perspective (Layer 7 obsessions clash!)
# 5. After interaction, you can join the conversation

# Example output:
# Nassim: "You're optimizing for the median case. What about tail risks?"
# Naval: "Agreed, but also—what's the leverage point? Where's the 10x?"
# Nassim: "Leverage creates fragility. You need optionality, not leverage."
# Naval: "Unless the leverage is in code, which scales without fragility."

# Switch to different pairing
*switch steve_jobs

# Now: Nassim vs Jobs debate
```

---

### Example 9: Roundtable Session 🎭

```bash
# Activate emulator
@emulator

# Launch roundtable with 4 minds

- Slash prefix: `/MMOS:tasks:task-name`
- Example: `/MMOS:tasks:viability-assessment`

### 3. **Memory Layer**
- Tracks all created minds and pipeline progress
- Query minds by fidelity, domain, use case
- History of brownfield updates

### 4. **Template Engine**
- Generates outputs using AIOS template system
- Supports variable interpolation and conditionals
- Consistent formatting across all outputs

### 5. **Validation Framework**
- Checklists integrate with QA workflows
- Automated quality gates
- Human checkpoint enforcement

### 6. **Database Integration**
- MMOS Database v3.0.0 (SQLite)
- Tables: `minds`, `sources`, `analysis`, `fragments`
- Integration script: `scripts/pipeline/db-integration-v3.sh`

---

## Getting Started

### 1. **Install the Pack**

```bash
npm run install:expansion mmos-mind-mapper
```

### 2. **Understand the Pipeline**

The MMOS pipeline has **6 phases** with **6 human checkpoints**:

| Phase | Description | Human Checkpoint | Duration |
|-------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| **1. Viability** | APEX + ICP scoring | GO/NO-GO decision | 30 mins |
| **2. Research** | Source discovery & collection | (Optional review) | 1-2 hours |
| **3. Analysis** | 8-layer cognitive extraction | ✅ Layers 6, 7, 8 validation | 6-8 hours |
| **4. Synthesis** | Frameworks & KB building | (Automated) | 1-2 hours |
| **5. Implementation** | System prompt compilation | ✅ Prompt review | 1-2 hours |
| **6. Testing** | Fidelity validation | ✅ Production approval | 1 hour |

**Total (Greenfield):** 10-16 hours wall time, 2-3M tokens

**Total (Brownfield):** 2-4 hours wall time, 500K-1M tokens

---

### 3. **Run Your First Mapping**

```bash
# Activate orchestrator
@mind-mapper

# Start pipeline (greenfield mode)
*map-mind

# Answer guided questions:
# - Who to map? (e.g., "Naval Ravikant")
# - What sources available? (books, podcasts, interviews, social media)
# - Target use case? (consultant, educator, creator, advisor)

# Pipeline executes with human checkpoints:
# → APEX scoring → GO/NO-GO decision (you decide)
# → Source collection → 15+ sources
# → Layer 1-4 extraction → Observable patterns (automated)
# → Layer 5 extraction → Mental models with triangulation
# → Layer 6 extraction → Values hierarchy (you validate)
# → Layer 7 extraction → Core obsessions (you validate)
# → Layer 8 extraction → Productive paradoxes (you validate - CRITICAL)
# → Architecture synthesis → Unified cognitive map
# → System prompt compilation → Generalista v1.0 (you review)
# → Fidelity testing → 94% target (you approve production)

# Final output: Production-ready system prompt at:
# outputs/minds/{mind_name}/system_prompts/system-prompt-generalista.md
```

---

### 4. **Validate Clone Quality**

```bash
# Activate validator
@system-prompt-architect

# Test fidelity
*test-fidelity

# Select mind: {mind_name}

# System runs:
# 1. Personality consistency tests (does it feel like the person?)
# 2. Knowledge accuracy tests (is information correct?)
# 3. Style fidelity tests (does it sound like the person?)
# 4. Edge case handling (paradoxes, contradictions)

# Target: 94% indistinguishability in blind tests

# Blind test protocol:
# - Show responses to people who know the original
# - Mix clone responses with real quotes
# - Measure: Can they tell the difference?
# - Success: <10% detection rate (94%+ indistinguishability)
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ **DO:**

- ✅ **Start with viability** - Always run APEX + ICP before investing tokens (saves 40%)
- ✅ **Prioritize depth** - Layers 6-8 sources (values, obsessions, paradoxes) are gold
- ✅ **Use brownfield** - Update incrementally for existing minds (saves 60-75%)
- ✅ **Test blind** - Validate clones with users who know the original
- ✅ **Document everything** - Logs are critical for quality tracking and rollback
- ✅ **Respect human checkpoints** - Layers 6, 7, 8 validation is non-negotiable
- ✅ **Enforce triangulation** - 3+ independent sources for identity layers
- ✅ **Focus on Layer 8** - Productive paradoxes differentiate human from robotic

---

### ❌ **DON'T:**

- ❌ **Skip viability** - 40% of candidates fail APEX (don't waste tokens!)
- ❌ **Rush analysis** - Layers 5-8 require triangulation (3+ sources minimum)
- ❌ **Ignore contradictions** - Layer 8 paradoxes are what make clones human
- ❌ **Modify methodology** - DNA Mental™ is battle-tested (94% fidelity proven)
- ❌ **Deploy untested** - Fidelity testing is mandatory (blind test protocol)
- ❌ **Skip human checkpoints** - Layers 6, 7, 8 too critical to auto-approve
- ❌ **Guess values** - Values hierarchy (Layer 6) must be evidence-based
