# Cognitive Analysis Task

## Purpose

Execute the proprietary DNA Mental™ 8-layer cognitive analysis methodology to extract and map the complete cognitive architecture of a mind. This task systematically analyzes sources from observable patterns (Layers 1-4) through deep identity structures (Layers 5-8), with mandatory triangulation and human validation for identity-critical layers. The output is a complete cognitive blueprint enabling 94% fidelity clones.

**Critical Success Factor:** Layer 8 (Productive Paradoxes) is what differentiates authentic human clones from robotic AI responses.

## When to Use This Task

**Use this task when:**
- Beginning Phase 3 (Analysis) after research collection complete
- sources_master.yaml exists with adequate coverage
- Need to extract complete 8-layer cognitive architecture
- Executing analysis phase from execute-mmos-pipeline orchestration

**Do NOT use this task when:**
- Sources not yet collected (use research-collection first)
- Updating existing cognitive architecture (use brownfield-update)
- Only need partial layer extraction (specify mode for targeted extraction)
**`layer_5`** - Mental Models extraction with triangulation
**`layer_6`** - Values Hierarchy extraction + **HUMAN CHECKPOINT**
**`layer_7`** - Core Obsessions extraction + **HUMAN CHECKPOINT**
**`layer_8`** - Productive Paradoxes extraction + **HUMAN CHECKPOINT**
**`architecture`** - Synthesize all layers into unified cognitive architecture
**`full`** - Execute complete 8-layer analysis with all checkpoints

## Key Activities & Instructions

### DNA Mental™ 8-Layer Framework

```yaml
layer_structure:
  observable_layers (1-4):
    description: "Surface patterns visible in behavior and communication"
    triangulation_required: false
    human_validation: optional

  cognitive_layers (5):
    description: "Thinking frameworks and mental models"
    triangulation_required: true
    human_validation: recommended

  identity_layers (6-8):
    description: "Core identity structures - values, obsessions, paradoxes"
    triangulation_required: mandatory
    human_validation: mandatory

layer_hierarchy:
  - "Layer 8 (Paradoxes) shapes Layer 7 (Obsessions)"
  - "Layer 7 (Obsessions) drives Layer 6 (Values)"
  - "Layer 6 (Values) filters Layer 5 (Mental Models)"
  - "Layer 5 (Mental Models) interprets Layer 4 (Recognition)"
  - "Layer 4 (Recognition) guides Layer 3 (Routines)"
  - "Layer 3 (Routines) expresses Layer 2 (Communication)"
  - "Layer 2 (Communication) manifests Layer 1 (Behavior)"
```

### Mode: Layers 1-4 (Observable Patterns)

**These layers can be extracted in parallel** as they're observational.

#### Layer 1: Behavioral Patterns

**Objective:** Extract observable actions, decisions, and behaviors across contexts.

**Analysis Framework:**
```yaml
behavioral_categories:
  decision_making:
    - "How do they approach decisions?"
    - "Fast vs slow decisions?"
    - "Data-driven vs intuition?"

  work_patterns:
    - "How do they structure work?"
    - "Solo vs collaborative?"
    - "Deep work vs reactive?"

  learning_behavior:
    - "How do they acquire knowledge?"
    - "Reading habits, courses, mentors?"
    - "Active vs passive learning?"

  relationship_patterns:
    - "How do they build relationships?"
    - "Network size and depth?"
    - "Collaboration style?"

  risk_behavior:

3. Identify consistent patterns across multiple sources
4. Note behavioral evolution over time
5. Document outlier behaviors (important for Layer 8 paradoxes)

**Output:** `minds/{mind}/artifacts/behavioral_patterns.md`

    - "Written vs spoken differences?"
```

**Extraction Process:**
1. Analyze linguistic patterns across source types
2. Extract 50+ signature phrases/expressions
3. Map rhetorical device usage frequency
4. Identify voice consistency metrics
5. Note context-dependent style variations

**Output:** `minds/{mind}/artifacts/writing_style.md`

```

**Output:** `minds/{mind}/artifacts/routine_analysis.md`

#### Layer 4: Recognition Patterns (Mental Radars)

**Objective:** Extract what they notice, pay attention to, and filter for.

**Analysis Framework:**
```yaml
recognition_categories:
  opportunity_radar:
    - "What opportunities do they spot that others miss?"
    - "Pattern recognition in their domain?"

  problem_detection:
    - "What problems do they notice first?"
    - "Red flags and warning signs?"

  people_assessment:

    - "What risks do they scan for?"
    - "Threat assessment patterns?"

  value_recognition:
    - "What do they consider valuable?"
    - "Undervalued things they seek?"
```

**Extraction Process:**
1. Identify repeated observations across sources ("I always look for...", "The first thing I notice...")
2. Extract assessment criteria they use
3. Map their attention filters
4. Document blind spots (what they don't notice)

**Output:** `minds/{mind}/artifacts/recognition_patterns.yaml`

```

### Mode: Layer 5 (Mental Models)

**Triangulation Required:** Must cross-reference findings across ≥3 sources.

#### Objective

Extract the thinking frameworks, reasoning patterns, and mental models they use to make sense of the world.

**Analysis Framework:**
```yaml
mental_model_categories:
  problem_solving_frameworks:
    - "How do they break down complex problems?"
    - "First principles vs analogical thinking?"
    - "What frameworks do they apply?"

  decision_frameworks:
    - "How do they evaluate options?"
    - "What criteria matter most?"
    - "Reversible vs irreversible decision handling?"

  worldview_models:
    - "Core beliefs about how things work?"
    - "Human nature assumptions?"
    - "System thinking patterns?"

  domain_specific_models:
    - "Unique models in their expertise area?"
    - "How do they think about their domain?"

  meta_cognitive_patterns:
    - "How do they think about thinking?"
    - "Self-awareness level?"
    - "Growth vs fixed mindset indicators?"
```

**Extraction Process:**

1. **First Pass:** Identify explicit frameworks mentioned
2. **Second Pass:** Infer implicit mental models from decisions/reasoning
3. **Triangulation:** Validate each model against ≥3 independent sources
4. **Consistency Check:** Verify models align with Layers 1-4
5. **Document Confidence:** Tag each model with evidence strength

**Triangulation Example:**
```yaml
mental_model: "Reversible vs Irreversible Decisions"
evidence:
  source_012: "Type 1 vs Type 2 decisions framework (explicit mention)"
  source_034: "Makes small bets quickly, agonizes over big commitments (implicit)"
  source_047: "'You can always change your mind later' philosophy (explicit)"
triangulation_score: 3/3 sources ✓
confidence: high
```

**Output:** `minds/{mind}/artifacts/mental_models.md`

### Mode: Layer 6 (Values Hierarchy) + HUMAN CHECKPOINT

**Triangulation Required:** Mandatory cross-reference across ≥3 sources.
**Human Validation:** Mandatory checkpoint before proceeding to Layer 7.

#### Objective

Extract core values in priority order, distinguishing stated values from demonstrated values.

**Analysis Framework:**
```yaml
values_extraction:
  stated_values:
    method: "Direct quotes about what matters"
    sources: [books, interviews, social media]

  demonstrated_values:
    method: "Infer from choices, sacrifices, time allocation"
    sources: [behavioral patterns from Layer 1]

  value_conflicts:
    method: "Note where stated and demonstrated diverge"
    importance: "Divergences feed Layer 8 paradoxes"

  value_evolution:
    method: "Track how values change over time"
    sources: [temporal analysis from Layer 3]

priority_determination:
  sacrifice_test: "What do they give up for what?"
  time_allocation: "Where do they invest time?"
  resource_allocation: "Where do they invest money/energy?"
  difficult_choices: "What do they choose in conflicts?"
```

**Extraction Process:**

1. **Extract Stated Values:** Direct quotes about what matters
2. **Extract Demonstrated Values:** Infer from actions (Layer 1)
3. **Triangulate:** Confirm each value across ≥3 sources
4. **Prioritize:** Rank values based on sacrifice/allocation tests
5. **Map Conflicts:** Document where stated ≠ demonstrated
6. **Temporal Analysis:** Track value evolution over time

**Output Draft:** `minds/{mind}/artifacts/values_hierarchy.yaml`

```yaml
values_hierarchy:
  top_tier_values:
    - value: "{{value_name}}"
      priority: 1
      stated_evidence:
        - source: source_003
          quote: "{{direct_quote}}"
        - source: source_018
          quote: "{{direct_quote}}"
      demonstrated_evidence:
        - behavior: "{{action_showing_value}}"
          frequency: "{{consistent/occasional}}"
        - sacrifice: "{{what_given_up_for_this}}"
      triangulation: 5/5 sources
      confidence: very_high

  [... continue for all values ...]

  value_conflicts:
    - conflict: "{{value_A}} vs {{value_B}}"
      context: "{{when_this_appears}}"
      resolution: "{{how_they_navigate}}"

  temporal_evolution:
    early_career: [{{values}}]
    mid_career: [{{values}}]
    current: [{{values}}]
    evolution_pattern: "{{description}}"
```

#### HUMAN CHECKPOINT: Layer 6 Validation

**Present to user:**

```markdown
## LAYER 6 VALIDATION REQUIRED

### Values Hierarchy Extracted

**Top 5 Core Values (Ranked by Priority):**

1. **{{value_1}}** - {{one_line_description}}
   - Stated: {{Y/N}} | Demonstrated: {{Y/N}}
   - Sources: {{count}} | Triangulation: {{percentage}}%

2. **{{value_2}}** - {{one_line_description}}
   - Stated: {{Y/N}} | Demonstrated: {{Y/N}}
   - Sources: {{count}} | Triangulation: {{percentage}}%

[... continue for all values ...]

### Value Conflicts Identified:
- {{conflict_1}}: {{description}}
- {{conflict_2}}: {{description}}

### Why This Matters:
Values hierarchy (Layer 6) is CRITICAL for clone authenticity. These values filter all decision-making and behavior in the system prompt. Incorrect values = inauthentic clone.

### Triangulation Status:
- Average source agreement: {{percentage}}%
- Stated vs demonstrated alignment: {{percentage}}%
- Confidence level: {{High/Medium/Low}}

---

**VALIDATION OPTIONS:**

1. **APPROVE** - Values hierarchy is accurate, proceed to Layer 7
2. **REVISE** - Provide corrections:
   - Missing values: [list]
   - Incorrect priorities: [specify]
   - Mischaracterizations: [specify]
3. **RE-ANALYZE** - Insufficient evidence, need deeper extraction

**Type 1, 2, or 3:**
```

**Process response:**
- **APPROVE**: Save values_hierarchy.yaml, proceed to Layer 7
- **REVISE**: Apply user corrections, update file, proceed to Layer 7
- **RE-ANALYZE**: Return to sources, execute deeper value extraction, re-present

### Mode: Layer 7 (Core Obsessions) + HUMAN CHECKPOINT

**Triangulation Required:** Mandatory across ≥3 sources.
**Human Validation:** Mandatory checkpoint before Layer 8.

#### Objective

Extract the 3-5 core obsessions that drive their work, thinking, and life focus.

**Analysis Framework:**
```yaml
obsession_detection:
  topic_frequency:
    method: "What topics appear obsessively across all sources?"
    threshold: "Present in >50% of sources"

  question_persistence:
    method: "What questions do they keep asking?"
    indicator: "Repeated across years"

  problem_dedication:
    method: "What problems consume their attention?"
    indicator: "Consistent focus despite obstacles"

  sacrifice_patterns:
    method: "What do they sacrifice other things for?"
    source: "Layer 6 values + Layer 1 behaviors"

  life_organizing_themes:
    method: "What themes organize their life/work?"
    indicator: "Everything connects to these"
```

**Extraction Process:**

1. **Topic Frequency Analysis:** Count mentions across all sources
2. **Question Mining:** Extract recurring questions they pose
3. **Problem Persistence:** Identify problems they won't let go
4. **Cross-Layer Validation:** Confirm against Layers 1-6
5. **Triangulate:** Verify each obsession across ≥3 sources
6. **Prioritize:** Rank obsessions by centrality to their work/life

**Output Draft:** `minds/{mind}/artifacts/core_obsessions.yaml`

```yaml
core_obsessions:
  - obsession: "{{title}}"
    rank: 1
    description: "{{what_they're_obsessed_with}}"
    manifestations:
      - "{{how_it_shows_up_1}}"
      - "{{how_it_shows_up_2}}"
    driving_question: "{{the_question_they_keep_asking}}"
    evidence:
      source_count: {{N}} sources
      quote_examples:
        - source: source_007
          quote: "{{quote}}"
        - source: source_023
          quote: "{{quote}}"
    connection_to_values: "{{which_Layer6_values_this_serves}}"
    temporal_span: "{{how_long_obsessed}}"
    confidence: {{high/medium/low}}

  [... repeat for all obsessions ...]

obsession_interconnections:
  - "{{obsession_1}} drives {{obsession_2}}"
  - "{{obsession_2}} and {{obsession_3}} are flip sides of same coin"
```

#### HUMAN CHECKPOINT: Layer 7 Validation

**Present to user:** (Similar format to Layer 6 checkpoint)

```markdown
## LAYER 7 VALIDATION REQUIRED

### Core Obsessions Identified

**Obsession 1: {{title}}**
- Description: {{one_line}}
- Driving Question: "{{question}}"
- Sources: {{count}} | Confidence: {{level}}

[... repeat for all obsessions ...]

### Why This Matters:
Core obsessions (Layer 7) are what the person *can't stop thinking about*. They drive all creative output and filter what problems they choose to tackle. Missing these = clone lacks authentic motivation.

---

**VALIDATION OPTIONS:**
1. APPROVE | 2. REVISE | 3. RE-ANALYZE

**Type 1, 2, or 3:**
```

### Mode: Layer 8 (Productive Paradoxes) + HUMAN CHECKPOINT

**This is the GOLD layer** - what makes clones feel genuinely human.

**Triangulation Required:** Mandatory across ≥3 sources.
**Human Validation:** Mandatory - most critical checkpoint.

#### Objective

Extract productive paradoxes - contradictions that coexist and create depth, wisdom, and authenticity.

**Critical Insight:** Humans aren't consistent. They hold contradictory beliefs that *both* make sense in different contexts. AI clones without paradoxes feel robotic and "uncanny valley."

**Analysis Framework:**
```yaml
paradox_detection:
  stated_contradictions:
    method: "Find explicit contradictions across sources"
    example: "Says 'plan everything' AND 'be spontaneous'"

  behavioral_contradictions:
    method: "Actions that contradict stated beliefs"
    source: "Layer 1 vs Layer 6"

  contextual_flexibility:
    method: "Same question, different answers by context"
    indicator: "Not wishy-washy, but contextually wise"

  value_tensions:
    method: "Values that pull in opposite directions"
    source: "Layer 6 value conflicts"

  evolution_paradoxes:
    method: "Beliefs that changed but both are 'true'"
    source: "Temporal analysis"

paradox_quality_criteria:
  productive: "Both sides serve a purpose"
  contextual: "Clear when each applies"
  authentic: "Genuinely held, not performance"
  conscious: "Aware of the paradox (ideally)"
```

**Extraction Process:**

1. **Mine Contradictions:** Find statements that seem to contradict
2. **Context Analysis:** Understand when each side applies
3. **Purpose Discovery:** Why both sides are valuable
4. **Triangulate:** Verify paradox across ≥3 sources
5. **Resolution Pattern:** How they navigate the tension
6. **Document:** Paradox title, contradiction, context, resolution

**Output Draft:** `minds/{mind}/artifacts/contradictions.yaml`

```yaml
productive_paradoxes:
  - paradox: "{{memorable_title}}"
    rank: 1
    contradiction:
      side_a: "{{belief/behavior_A}}"
      side_b: "{{belief/behavior_B}}"
    apparent_conflict: "{{why_these_seem_contradictory}}"

    contextual_resolution:
      when_side_a: "{{context_when_A_applies}}"
      when_side_b: "{{context_when_B_applies}}"

    deeper_truth: "{{why_both_are_actually_true}}"

    evidence:
      source_count: {{N}}
      examples:
        - source: source_005
          quote_a: "{{showing_side_A}}"
        - source: source_018
          quote_b: "{{showing_side_B}}"

    navigation_pattern: "{{how_they_decide_which_to_apply}}"

    connection_to_obsessions: "{{which_Layer7_obsessions_this_serves}}"

    clone_implementation: "{{how_to_encode_this_in_system_prompt}}"

    confidence: {{high/medium/low}}

  [... repeat for all paradoxes ...]

paradox_system:
  total_paradoxes: {{count}}
  interconnections: "{{how_paradoxes_relate}}"
  overall_pattern: "{{meta_paradox_if_exists}}"
```

**Example Paradox:**
```yaml
paradox: "The Structured Spontaneity Paradox"
contradiction:
  side_a: "Rigorous planning and systems"
  side_b: "Embrace serendipity and randomness"
contextual_resolution:
  when_side_a: "For mission-critical work, foundation building"
  when_side_b: "For creativity, learning, new opportunities"
deeper_truth: "Structure creates freedom for spontaneity"
```

#### HUMAN CHECKPOINT: Layer 8 Validation

**Present to user:**

```markdown
## LAYER 8 VALIDATION REQUIRED - MOST CRITICAL

### Productive Paradoxes Extracted

**Why Layer 8 is the Differentiator:**
Paradoxes are what separate authentic human clones from robotic AI. Humans aren't consistent - they hold contradictory truths that both make sense. Without Layer 8, clones feel "uncanny valley" and overly rigid.

**Paradox 1: {{title}}**
- **Contradiction:** "{{belief_A}}" AND "{{belief_B}}"
- **Context:** Side A when {{context_A}}, Side B when {{context_B}}
- **Deeper Truth:** {{why_both_true}}
- **Sources:** {{count}} | Confidence: {{level}}

[... repeat for all paradoxes ...]

### Paradox System:
Total paradoxes: {{count}}
Interconnections: {{how_they_relate}}

### Example Clone Behavior:
Without Layer 8: "{{robotic_response}}"
With Layer 8: "{{nuanced_contextual_response}}"

---

**VALIDATION OPTIONS:**
1. APPROVE - Paradoxes capture authentic complexity, proceed to architecture synthesis
2. REVISE - Adjust paradoxes: [provide corrections]
3. RE-ANALYZE - Missing critical paradoxes, need deeper extraction

**This is your LAST checkpoint before synthesis. Review carefully.**

**Type 1, 2, or 3:**
```

### Mode: Architecture (Synthesis of All 8 Layers)

**Execute after all 8 layers validated.**

#### Objective

Synthesize all 8 layers into unified cognitive architecture showing how layers interconnect.

**Synthesis Framework:**
```yaml
cognitive_architecture:
  layer_integration:
    - "How Layer 8 paradoxes shape Layer 7 obsessions"
    - "How Layer 7 obsessions prioritize Layer 6 values"
    - "How Layer 6 values filter Layer 5 mental models"
    - "How Layer 5 mental models interpret Layer 4 recognition"
    - "How Layer 4 recognition guides Layer 3 routines"
    - "How Layer 3 routines express Layer 2 communication"
    - "How Layer 2 communication manifests Layer 1 behavior"

  cognitive_flow_maps:
    input_stimulus:
      - "External input (question, problem, situation)"
      - "↓ Layer 4: What they notice/filter for"
      - "↓ Layer 5: Which mental model they apply"
      - "↓ Layer 6: Which values filter the interpretation"
      - "↓ Layer 7: Which obsession this connects to"
      - "↓ Layer 8: Which paradox side this context triggers"
      - "↓ Layer 2: How they communicate response"
      - "→ Output behavior (Layer 1)"

  decision_architecture:
    routine_decision: "{{which_layers_activate}}"
    important_decision: "{{which_layers_activate}}"
    identity_decision: "{{which_layers_activate}}"

  authenticity_mechanisms:
    consistency_sources: "{{what_keeps_them_consistent}}"
    flexibility_sources: "{{what allows_adaptation}}"
    paradox_navigation: "{{how_they_hold_contradictions}}"
```

### Mode: Full (Complete 8-Layer Analysis)

**Execute complete cognitive analysis with all checkpoints:**

1. Extract Layers 1-4 in parallel
2. Extract Layer 5 with triangulation
3. Extract Layer 6 + **HUMAN CHECKPOINT**
4. Extract Layer 7 + **HUMAN CHECKPOINT**
5. Extract Layer 8 + **HUMAN CHECKPOINT**
6. Synthesize cognitive architecture
7. Present complete analysis to user

## Outputs

### Layers 1-4 Outputs
- `minds/{mind}/artifacts/behavioral_patterns.md`
- `minds/{mind}/artifacts/writing_style.md`
- `minds/{mind}/artifacts/routine_analysis.md`
- `minds/{mind}/artifacts/recognition_patterns.yaml`

### Layer 5 Output
- `minds/{mind}/artifacts/mental_models.md`

### Layer 6 Output
- `minds/{mind}/artifacts/values_hierarchy.yaml`

### Layer 7 Output
- `minds/{mind}/artifacts/core_obsessions.yaml`

### Layer 8 Output
- `minds/{mind}/artifacts/contradictions.yaml`

### Architecture Output

- `minds/{mind}/docs/LIMITATIONS.md` (known gaps)

## Validation Criteria

Cognitive analysis is successful when:

- [ ] **All 8 layers extracted**: Complete DNA Mental coverage
- [ ] **Triangulation complete**: Layers 5-8 validated across ≥3 sources minimum
- [ ] **Human checkpoints passed**: Layers 6, 7, 8 user-validated
- [ ] **Cognitive architecture synthesized**: Integration map complete
- [ ] **Clone-critical elements identified**: What must be in system prompt
- [ ] **Limitations documented**: Known gaps and uncertainties acknowledged
- [ ] **Quality thresholds met**: Triangulation ≥70%, confidence ≥Medium on identity layers
- [ ] **Ready for synthesis phase**: All artifacts validated and saved

## Integration with AIOS

### Memory Layer
```typescript
memory.store({
  collection: 'mmos_analysis',
  document: {
    mind_name: '{{mind}}',
    layers_complete: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],
    checkpoints_passed: [6,7,8],
    architecture_compiled: '{{timestamp}}',
    fidelity_projection: '{{percentage}}'
  }
});
```

### Database Integration (Post-Analysis)

**After completing cognitive-spec.yaml**, integrate with MMOS Database v3.0.0:

```bash
# Run database integration pipeline
bash scripts/pipeline/db-integration-v3.sh \
  --mind {{mind_slug}} \
  --mode full \
  --reprocess skip
```

This will:
1. **Populate sources** from `sources_master.yaml` → `sources` table
2. **Import analysis** from `cognitive-spec.yaml` → `analysis` table
3. **Extract fragments** (blocked - requires InnerLens expansion pack)
4. **Validate integrity** - Check referential integrity and data quality

**Validation Output:**
```
📊 VALIDATION SUMMARY
Sources: {{count}}
Analysis: {{count}}
Fragments: {{count}}
Errors: 0
Warnings: {{count}}

✅ VALIDATION PASSED
```

**Re-processing modes:**
- `skip` (default): Safe mode, won't overwrite existing data
- `update`: Update existing records with new data
- `fresh`: Delete all existing data for this mind and re-import ⚠️

**Note:** Fragment extraction is currently blocked pending InnerLens expansion pack implementation (Epic TBD).

### Agent Coordination
- **@cognitive-analyst**: Executes all layer extractions
- **@architect**: Synthesizes cognitive architecture
- **User**: Validates Layers 6, 7, 8 (mandatory)
- **Database Pipeline**: Automatically ingests results into MMOS DB v3.0.0

### Performance Estimates
- Layers 1-4: 2-3 hours, 300K tokens (parallel)
- Layer 5: 1 hour, 100K tokens
- Layer 6: 1.5 hours, 150K tokens + human time
- Layer 7: 1.5 hours, 150K tokens + human time
- Layer 8: 2 hours, 200K tokens + human time (most critical)
- Architecture: 1 hour, 100K tokens
- **Database Integration**: 1-2 minutes
- **Total: 9-11 hours, 1M tokens**

## Notes

- **Layer 8 is the differentiator**: Without paradoxes, clones feel robotic
- **Human checkpoints non-negotiable**: Layers 6-8 too critical to auto-approve
- **Triangulation mandatory for identity**: Layers 5-8 require multi-source confirmation
- **Stated ≠ Demonstrated**: Watch for value conflicts, they reveal authenticity
- **Temporal evolution matters**: How they changed shows growth patterns
- **Document uncertainty**: Better to acknowledge gaps than fake completeness
- **Layer hierarchy is real**: Layer 8 shapes 7, 7 drives 6, etc. - respect the structure
