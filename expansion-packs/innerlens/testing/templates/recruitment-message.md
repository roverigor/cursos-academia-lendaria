## In-Person Pitch (Friends/Colleagues)

---

"Hey [Name], quick question - would you be interested in helping me test a personality analysis tool I'm working on?

It's called InnerLens Lite, and it uses AI to analyze your Big Five personality traits from written text - like essays, blog posts, emails, that kind of thing.

**What you'd do:**
- Take a 10-minute personality quiz (standard Big Five)
- Share 500-2000 words of your writing (totally anonymized)
- Get a free detailed personality report in return

**Time commitment:** About 30-45 minutes total, at your own pace.

**Privacy:** Everything's anonymized, you can review the consent form first, and you can back out anytime.

I'm trying to validate the accuracy - basically comparing the AI's analysis to self-reported scores from 10-15 people.

Interested? No pressure if you're not into it, but I figured I'd ask since [you're a writer / you're into psychology / you like this kind of stuff]!"

## FAQ (Include with any recruitment message)

**Q: What is the Big Five?**
A: The most scientifically validated personality framework. Measures 5 traits: Openness (curiosity), Conscientiousness (organization), Extraversion (sociability), Agreeableness (cooperation), Neuroticism (emotional stability). Based on 70,000+ studies across 50+ countries.

**Q: How does the AI analyze text?**
A: It extracts "Minimal Interpretable Units" (behavioral fragments) from your writing, then maps them to Big Five traits using linguistic markers validated by research. For example, "I love exploring new ideas" signals high Openness.

**Q: Is this like MBTI?**
A: No. MBTI lacks scientific validation. Big Five is the gold standard in academic psychology, with decades of peer-reviewed research backing it.

**Q: What kind of text do you need?**
A: Anything that shows your personality! Best: personal essays, interview transcripts, journal entries, blog posts, email conversations. Avoid: pure facts (resume), code without comments, non-English text.

**Q: What if my writing is private/embarrassing?**
A: You can remove any sensitive content before sharing. We only need personality-relevant text (opinions, decisions, behaviors). And everything is anonymized - we never see your name, only "subject_001."

**Q: Will you sell my data?**
A: Absolutely not. This is pure research. Your anonymized data may be used to publish accuracy results (e.g., "InnerLens achieved 78% correlation with self-reports"), but never in a way that identifies you.

**Q: Can I see the consent form first?**
A: Yes! We'll send it before you commit. You can review it, ask questions, and only proceed if comfortable.

**Q: What if I don't like my results?**
A: Remember, this is a research tool, not a diagnostic assessment. The results show patterns in your writing, which may differ from how you see yourself. If anything feels wrong, we'd love your feedback - it helps improve the tool!

**Q: When will I get my results?**
A: Within 3-5 days of submitting your text. Analysis takes ~2 minutes to run, but we batch process to optimize costs.

**Q: I'm not 18. Can I still participate?**
A: Unfortunately, no. Informed consent requires age 18+ for research involving personality data.

**Q: My writing is in Portuguese/Spanish. Can I participate?**
A: Not for the MVP (v1.0), which only supports English. We're planning multilingual support for v1.2 (3-4 months out). If you're interested, I can reach out when that's ready!
