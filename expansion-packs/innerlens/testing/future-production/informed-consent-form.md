**Study Title:** Validation of InnerLens Lite Big Five Personality Analysis System
**Principal Investigator:** Alan Nicolas (Academia Lendar[IA])
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-01-15

---

## 1. Introduction

You are being invited to participate in a research study to validate the accuracy of **InnerLens Lite**, an AI-powered system that analyzes personality traits from written text using the Big Five framework.

**Please read this form carefully.** Ask questions about anything you don't understand before deciding whether to participate.

**Participation is voluntary.** You may choose not to participate or withdraw at any time without penalty.

---

## 2. Purpose of the Study

**What is being studied?**
We are testing whether InnerLens Lite can accurately predict Big Five personality scores from written text samples.

**Why is this research being conducted?**
To validate the accuracy of the system before public release. We aim to achieve 75%+ correlation between AI-predicted scores and self-reported scores.

**Who is conducting this research?**
- **Principal Investigator:** Alan Nicolas, Academia Lendar[IA]
- **Affiliation:** InnerLens Lite Development Team
- **Funding:** Self-funded (no external sponsors)

---

## 3. Study Procedures

**If you agree to participate, you will be asked to:**

### Step 1: Complete a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (10 minutes)
- You will take the IPIP-NEO-50 Big Five personality questionnaire
- 50 items (10 per trait) measuring Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism
- Available online at: https://ipip.ori.org/
- Your scores will be used as "ground truth" for comparison

### Step 2: Provide Written Text Samples (5-15 minutes)
- You will share 500-2000 words of your personal writing
- **Acceptable formats:** Personal essays, blog posts, interview transcripts, email conversations, journal entries, social media posts
- **Not acceptable:** Purely factual content (resumes, news articles), code without explanatory text, non-English text
- You may **remove sensitive information** (names, addresses, company names, etc.) before submitting

### Step 3: Review Your Results (Optional, 10-15 minutes)
- You will receive a detailed personality report including:
  - Big Five scores (0-100 for each trait)
  - Confidence levels (0-100%)
  - Evidence quotes from your text
  - Validation quality report
- You may provide feedback on the accuracy and usefulness of the report

**Total time commitment:** 30-45 minutes over 1-2 days (at your convenience)

## 4. Risks and Discomforts

**Minimal risk.** This study involves no more risk than everyday use of technology. However, you should be aware of:

### Potential Psychological Discomfort
- **Unexpected results:** The AI may predict personality scores that differ from your self-perception. This can be surprising or uncomfortable.
- **Self-reflection:** Reviewing personality analysis may prompt self-reflection that some find emotionally challenging.
- **Mitigation:** Remember this is a research tool, not a clinical diagnosis. Scores reflect patterns in your writing, which may vary by context.

### Privacy Risks
- **Data breach:** As with any digital system, there is a small risk of unauthorized access to your data.
- **Re-identification:** Although data is anonymized, sophisticated analysis could theoretically re-identify you from writing style.
- **Mitigation:** We use industry-standard encryption, anonymization (you are "subject_001", not your name), and secure storage. Data is not shared publicly in identifiable form.

### No Known Risks For:
- Physical harm
- Social harm (your participation is confidential)
- Economic harm (no cost to you, no impact on employment/insurance)
- Legal harm (personality analysis is not a protected category)

### Exceptions to Confidentiality
We may be required to disclose your information if:

## Appendix A: Big Five Framework Overview

**What is the Big Five?**

The Big Five (also called OCEAN or Five-Factor Model) is the most scientifically validated personality framework in psychology, based on 70,000+ peer-reviewed studies across 50+ countries.

**The 5 traits:**

   - Imagination, curiosity, creativity, unconventionality
   - High: Artistic, philosophical, adventurous
   - Low: Practical, conventional, routine-oriented

2. **Conscientiousness (C)**
   - Organization, discipline, achievement, reliability
   - High: Organized, punctual, goal-driven
   - Low: Spontaneous, flexible, casual

3. **Extraversion (E)**

   - High: Outgoing, talkative, energetic in groups
   - Low: Reserved, reflective, prefer solitude

4. **Agreeableness (A)**
   - Cooperation, empathy, trust, altruism
   - High: Kind, cooperative, trusting
   - Low: Direct, skeptical, competitive

5. **Neuroticism (N)** (or Emotional Stability)

   - Low: Calm, resilient, emotionally stable

**Scientific backing:**
- **Test-retest reliability:** 70-80% over 10+ years
