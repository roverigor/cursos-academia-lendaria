Master, How Do I Believe?

Student (S). Master (M).
S: Master, there is a question that I have wanted to ask you for a very long
time. But I’ve never quite known how to ask it.
M: Speak freely, student.
S: Since I cannot formulate the words in a refined way, I shall just express
to you my sentiments in their raw form.
M: That is the best way, my student.
S: Master, many of the things that you speak of to me and to those who
come to you seem fantastical. They sound beautiful. And I am very taken
by them. But sometimes they seem impractical to me. I suppose what I seek
more than anything is to believe. As you believe.
M: This is a very sincere question, my student. It has the signs of coming
straight from the heart. I am humbled to receive it. You must understand
something very clearly, my student. I have no faith in belief. Nor do I
subscribe to any belief. Either I Know, or I Do Not Know. But I do not
“believe.”
S: Then I seek to Know the things that you Know. But something tells me
that when you say the word Know, you are not speaking of an intellectual
sort of Knowing.

M: Your intelligence is keen, student. You are perfectly correct. To Know
something intellectually is to never have known it at all.
S: And this is my quandary. The things that you speak of I am completely
taken by. And I am taken by them in the heart. But I “know” them only in
the head.
M: It must be so, student. For this is the way it begins for all human beings.
S: Even for you, Master?
M: Most certainly. Every man who becomes wise was once a fool. In the
beginning, I too understood things on a purely intellectual level.
S: Then how did this intellectual understanding transform into a Knowing?
M: Shall I tell you precisely how it happens?
S: Yes, Master. Please.
M: It happens through a constant revisitation of the ideal that you wish to
Know. A constant revisitation allows it to seep into one’s bones. A constant
revisitation allows one to Understand it from all angles. And that which was
once Intellectual, in time becomes Experiential. And the space within
oneself that was once occupied by The Mind, slowly becomes replaced by
the Knowing. And the human being begins to Become the ideal that he so
eagerly has revisited.
S: And how is this revisiting done, Master?
M: Nature gives nothing for Free, my student.
S: I do not understand.
M: The time is inappropriate for such a question, student. First you must
find an ideal that you truly, truly wish to imbibe. An ideal that makes you
shake. An ideal that literally brings tears to your eyes. For this will

demonstrate your Authenticity for wanting to know it on more than simply
an intellectual level.
S: I see.
M: You must understand, student, that most men have no interest in such
depth. They trade and roam in the cosmetics of how’s and wherefore’s.
They have no authentic longing for anything. They are interested only in
window shopping. They seek to live their lives on safe and comfortable
shores, never daring to drink the ocean.
S: And as for the practicality of such lofty ideals?
M: You must understand something, my student. Nothing in the world is
practical unless it is first Non-negotiable.
S: Please explain, Master.
M: For a man who stands on the shore, diving into the depths of the ocean
can never be practical. No methodology will suit him. For “practicality” is
not meant for the Seeker. It is meant for the scientist. And it is only The
Artist who tastes the nectar of life. The scientist tastes only the bitter
chemicals found in test tubes.
S: Then how shall I proceed?
M: My student, the human being who is not swimming in Sincerity cannot
ever be given a Way that is sufficiently practical for him. First he must dive
into the depths, and Then learn the practicality of swimming.
S: One such Ocean of which I speak is Freedom. No matter how much I try,
I cannot find it, Master.
M: You must first discover what you seek Freedom For and Freedom From.
What is your personal definition of Freedom? What is it that you would like
to happen to you? What does it look like? What does it feel like? You must
answer many such questions. And you must examine your answers in order

to see if they are of the Mind or of the Heart. How Insane are you for the
things that you seek? How insane are you for this Freedom?
S: Yes, I must do precisely that.
M: You see, my student, every man speaks as you do. They speak of
impracticality and difficulties and loftiness . . . But even the Impossible is
made Possible by a man’s Sincerity. Impossibility simply has no power in
the face of Genuine Desire. None whatsoever. Every single man will have
what he Insists upon having. And if he insists upon nothing in particular, he
will live in the default and wayward musings of The Mind. Unless you are
going Somewhere, you are going Nowhere. And even Nowhere is the
Perfect place to go if you are specifically going Nowhere.
S: I have nothing to say, Master.
M: Impossibility will bow at your alter, my student. But first become a man
worthy of being bowed to. Not through fame and accomplishment. But
through Uncompromising Sincerity. Be not a pretender, my dear student. Be
Uncompromising. For the man who refuses to compromise holds The
Universe in his hands.
S: Thank you, my Master.
