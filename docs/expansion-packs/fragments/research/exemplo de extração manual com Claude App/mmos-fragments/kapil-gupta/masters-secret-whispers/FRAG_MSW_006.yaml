type: "criterion"
relevance: 9
content: "First you must find an ideal that you truly, truly wish to imbibe. An ideal that makes you shake. An ideal that literally brings tears to your eyes. For this will demonstrate your Authenticity for wanting to know it on more than simply an intellectual level."

# ENHANCEMENT (3 campos)
context: |
  Master explains WHY he won't give methodology yet.
  Student must first find an ideal that produces visceral 
  response - shaking, tears - as proof of authentic longing 
  beyond intellectual curiosity.

insight: |
  Authenticity test: Visceral physical/emotional response.
  Criteria for genuine desire:
  - Makes you shake (somatic response)
  - Brings tears (emotional depth)
  - "truly, truly" (emphasis on authentic vs performative)
  
  This distinguishes intellectual window shopping from 
  genuine seeking. No methodology given to window shoppers.
  
  Implication: If you don't have visceral response to an ideal,
  you're not ready for the path to it. Find what moves you first.
  
  Anti-pattern: Seeking methods for things you don't deeply want.
