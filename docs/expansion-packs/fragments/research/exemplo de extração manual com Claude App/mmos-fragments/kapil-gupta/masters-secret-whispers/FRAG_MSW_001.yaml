# ENHANCEMENT (3 campos)
context: |
  Student asks Master how to believe in the teachings. 
  Master's foundational response distinguishes his entire philosophy 
  from faith-based systems. This is the cornerstone axiom that 
  separates Knowledge (experiential, self-evident) from Belief 
  (faith-based, unverified).

insight: |
  Core distinction: Master rejects belief systems entirely. 
  Only two states exist: Knowing (direct experience) or Not Knowing.
  Belief is dismissed as an intermediate delusion.
  This axiom underpins all subsequent teachings about Truth, 
  prescriptions, and the path to mastery.
  
  Anti-pattern: Seeking to "believe" teachings.
  Correct pattern: Seek to Know through direct experience.
