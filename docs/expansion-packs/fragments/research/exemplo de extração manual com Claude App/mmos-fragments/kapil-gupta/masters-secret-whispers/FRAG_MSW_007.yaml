content: "Most men have no interest in such depth. They trade and roam in the cosmetics of how's and wherefore's. They have no authentic longing for anything. They are interested only in window shopping. They seek to live their lives on safe and comfortable shores, never daring to drink the ocean."

# ENHANCEMENT (3 campos)
context: |
  After describing the authenticity criterion, Master 
  observes that most people don't actually want depth.
  They're interested in surface-level engagement 
  ("window shopping") not transformation ("drinking the ocean").

insight: |
  Behavioral pattern of majority:
  - No authentic longing
  - Cosmetics of how's and wherefore's (methods collecting)
  - Window shopping (browsing without commitment)
  - Safe shores (avoiding risk/depth)
  - Won't drink the ocean (won't fully immerse)
  
  Distinction: window shoppers vs seekers.
  Most people THINK they want transformation but only want 
  comfortable, safe engagement with ideas.
  
  This explains why prescriptions don't work for most - 
  they're not seeking genuine transformation, just 
  intellectual entertainment.
  
  Metaphor: shore vs ocean depth (safety vs full immersion).
