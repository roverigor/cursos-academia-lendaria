# ENHANCEMENT (3 campos)
context: |
  After revealing the framework of constant revisitation, 
  student asks "how is this revisiting done?" Master responds 
  with this axiom and refuses to elaborate until student 
  demonstrates authentic desire.

insight: |
  Universal law: Everything has a price. No shortcuts.
  Master refuses to give "how-to" without evidence of 
  authentic commitment (sincerity test).
  
  Teaching method: Withhold methodology until student proves 
  worthy through demonstration of genuine longing, not 
  intellectual curiosity.
  
  Anti-prescription stance: Methods are not given freely to 
  window shoppers. Only to those with "authentic longing."
  
  This explains why Master doesn't write prescriptive books - 
  prescriptions given freely are worthless.
