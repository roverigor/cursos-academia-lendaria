# ENHANCEMENT (3 campos)
context: |
  Student distinguishes between intellectual understanding 
  (head knowledge) and deeper Knowing. Master confirms this 
  distinction with an absolute statement that intellectual 
  knowledge is not true Knowing.

insight: |
  Radical claim: Intellectual understanding is valueless for 
  transformation. True Knowing must be experiential, embodied, 
  "in the bones" rather than conceptual.
  
  This rejects the Western emphasis on intellectual comprehension 
  as sufficient. Knowledge that remains theoretical is not Knowledge.
  
  Implication: Reading/understanding teachings intellectually 
  accomplishes nothing. Must transform into lived experience.
