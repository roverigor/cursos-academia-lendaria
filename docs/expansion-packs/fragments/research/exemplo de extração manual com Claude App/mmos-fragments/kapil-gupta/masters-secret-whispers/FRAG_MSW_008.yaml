# ENHANCEMENT (3 campos)
context: |
  Student asks about practicality of "lofty ideals."
  Master responds with axiom that inverts common understanding:
  practicality follows commitment, not vice versa.

insight: |
  Inverted logic: People seek "practical methods" first,
  but Master says practicality only emerges AFTER something 
  becomes non-negotiable (absolute commitment).
  
  Sequence:
  1. Make ideal non-negotiable (total commitment)
  2. THEN practicality reveals itself
  
  NOT:
  1. Find practical method
  2. Then commit
  
  This explains why "how-to" questions are premature before 
  demonstrating non-negotiable commitment. The how reveals 
  itself to the committed.
  
  Anti-prescription: Methods don't work for those seeking 
  comfort/practicality. They work only for those who've 
  already made the ideal non-negotiable.
