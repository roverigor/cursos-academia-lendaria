source: "A Master's Secret Whispers"
location: "Chapter: How Do I Believe?, Master reveals his own path"
type: "direct_quote"
relevance: 8
content: "Every man who becomes wise was once a fool. In the beginning, I too understood things on a purely intellectual level."

# ENHANCEMENT (3 campos)
context: |
  Student asks if even Master started with intellectual 
  understanding. Master confirms universality of the path 
  from ignorance to wisdom, including himself.

insight: |
  Humility + universality: No one begins wise. All masters 
  were once beginners. This normalizes the student's current 
  state and reveals the path is universal, not exceptional.
  
  Anti-elitism: Master was once exactly where student is now.
  Wisdom is not innate; it's developed through process.
  
  Implication: Current state of "not knowing" is not a defect 
  but the necessary starting point.
