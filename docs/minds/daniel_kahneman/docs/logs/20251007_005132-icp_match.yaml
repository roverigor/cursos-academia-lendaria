      PERFECT ALIGNMENT. Daniel Kahneman literally defined the modern study of
      cognitive biases and clear thinking. His entire career focused on:
      - Identifying heuristics and biases
      - Teaching System 1 vs System 2 thinking
      - Demonstrating how intuition misleads us
      - Providing frameworks for clearer thought

      This is not just "good alignment" - this IS his life's work.
    evidence:
      - "Heuristics and Biases research program (1970s-1990s)"
      - "Thinking, Fast and Slow - entire book on this exact topic"
      - "Nobel Prize specifically for work on judgment under uncertainty"
      - "Anchoring, availability, representativeness - bias frameworks"

  audience_fit:
    weight: 25%
    score: 10
    max: 10
    assessment: |
      EXCEPTIONAL FIT. Kahneman mastered communicating complex psychology to:
      - General audiences (bestselling author)
      - Professionals (finance, policy, business)
      - Academics (rigorous researcher)
      - Students (Princeton professor)

      His communication style is:
      - Clear and accessible
      - Story-driven with memorable examples
      - Balanced between depth and simplicity
      - Humble and honest about limitations
    evidence:
      - "Thinking, Fast and Slow: international bestseller"
      - "TED talks, podcast interviews for general public"
      - "Academic papers with 50,000+ citations"
      - "Presidential Medal of Freedom - broad cultural impact"

  use_case_specificity:
    weight: 20%
    score: 10
    max: 10
    assessment: |
      MAXIMUM SPECIFICITY. Content is laser-focused on:
      - Naming and explaining specific biases (20+ major biases)
      - Providing clear examples of bias in action
      - Teaching detection strategies
      - Offering debiasing techniques

      Not generic philosophy - concrete, actionable bias recognition.
    evidence:
      - "Confirmation bias, anchoring bias, availability heuristic - extensively documented"
      - "System 1/System 2 framework for understanding automatic vs deliberate thinking"
      - "Pre-mortem technique for debiasing group decisions"
      - "Noise framework for identifying unwanted variability in judgment"

  accessibility:
    weight: 15%
    score: 9
    max: 10
    assessment: |
      HIGHLY ACCESSIBLE with minor caveats. Kahneman's writing is:
      - Clear and jargon-light (for academic psychology)
      - Rich in relatable examples
      - Structured for learning

      Small deduction: Some concepts require focused attention. Thinking,
      Fast and Slow is accessible but not "easy reading" - demands engagement.
      Perfect for motivated learners, may need synthesis for casual users.
    evidence:
      - "Thinking Fast Slow written for general audience (not academics)"
      - "Uses everyday examples: coffee mugs, gambling, medical decisions"
      - "However: 500+ pages, dense with insights - not light reading"

  roi_potential:
    weight: 10%
    score: 10
    max: 10
    assessment: |
      EXCEPTIONAL ROI. Value proposition is extraordinary:

      INVESTMENT:
      - ~8-12 hours wall time (with parallelization)
      - ~2-3M tokens (~$20-30 at current rates)
      - High-quality sources readily available

      EXPECTED VALUE:
      - Applicable to virtually all decision-making contexts
      - Relevant for individuals, teams, organizations
      - Timeless content (not time-bound trends)
      - Massive potential audience (anyone who makes decisions)
      - Differentiation: THE authoritative voice on biases

      ROI = VERY HIGH. Investment modest, value creation massive.
    evidence:
      - "Behavioral economics consulting industry = billions"
      - "Thinking Fast Slow sold millions - proven demand"
      - "Source material readily available (books, interviews, papers)"

  interpretation: "PERFECT MATCH (90-100%) - Highest ROI expected"

  match_quality: |
    This is as close to a perfect ICP match as possible. Daniel Kahneman's
    life work was EXACTLY "teaching people to think clearly and recognize biases."

    The only reason this isn't 100% is the accessibility dimension (9/10) -
    some synthesis needed for casual audiences. Otherwise: PERFECT.
