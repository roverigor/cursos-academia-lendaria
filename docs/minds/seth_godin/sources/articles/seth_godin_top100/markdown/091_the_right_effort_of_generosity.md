Don’t expect much from a drowning man. He’s not going to offer you a candy bar or ask how your day was.

It requires the space to take your mind off your own problems long enough to see someone else’s.

It requires the confidence to share when a big part of you wants to hoard.

Generosity begins by trusting ourselves enough to know that we’re not actually drowning.
