I did an interview with a leading Turkish vlogger. He sent me his work (in Turkish) and of course, the thing I noticed was this:

76 people who saw this interview took the time to give it a thumbs down. The interviewer flew across the world and shared his work for free, but 76 people hated it enough to affirmatively vote it down.

Of course, 1% of 108,000 is about a thousand. This is less than a tenth of that.

In fact, 1% of the 10,000 people who voted it up is 100. It’s even less than that.

In just about everything we do, 99% approval is astonishing.

Because online, our lizard brain goes straight to the tiny speck, the little number that’s easy to magnify.

Ignore it. Shun the non-believers and ship your work.
