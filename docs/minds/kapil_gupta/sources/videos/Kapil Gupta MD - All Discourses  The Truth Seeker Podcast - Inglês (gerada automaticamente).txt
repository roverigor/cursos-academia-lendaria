he who is coached
will have his potential destroyed
a discourse
there really is little to no
maliciousness
or ill intent by
any coach
whether it be in business or sports or
in life
life coaching is essentially an oxymoron
regardless of the fact that there's no
ill intent
where there is a lack of understanding
there must be destruction an
illustration may help to
make this more clear
imagine that an individual is throwing a
baseball and he is told
that he's standing in a room
where he is standing in a
on a field and he's told to throw the
baseball as hard as he can into the net
the human being will make a movement
he'll make an action
he will perhaps he'll perhaps
from an observer's point of view have
the
left leg very far forward and his right
arm
very far back in order to create the
greatest amount of leverage
to throw that baseball as
fast as he can
into the net with as much power
and speed as he can very well what
coaching does with the coaching
societies
the entire industry
because they are not based in truth they
are based in form
they're based on cosmetics what they
will do
is that they will watch this individual
and they will say okay we're going to
teach others now how to throw
as hard and fast as him so what we will
do is okay we will get
a player
and
well we will watch the original player
first to see how he did it and we will
take videos
and then we will we will capture angles
we will capture the angle of his arm
the angle of his front knee the length
of his stride then what they will do is
they'll say okay we have noticed that
the best players when they pitch when
they throw
a fastball when they throw something
hard and fast
their right arm will be at this degrees
the right elbow will have an x degree
bend in it their left leg will be this
many inches past their right leg
their left knee will have this kind of
bend in it
and they will contort the individual
they will make him
adhere
to the form
which
is reminiscent of
all of the great players
they will tell him you do that too this
is very typical this is par for the
course this is this is typical of human
beings and it doesn't matter if a human
being becomes a coach or he becomes a
construction worker or
whatever he becomes the human being is
still a human being and since all human
beings virtually all human beings do not
have a basis in truth they do not seek
truth they go to school and they get a
certificate and then they
practice the things that they were
taught in school
in the real world because i think that's
real and if you examine the number of
people who become successful in anything
it is extraordinarily small
it is less than a percent
that by itself demonstrates the um
complete inefficacy of of coaching and
uh essentially topples the entire
industry on its ear
so they will tell the individual to copy
the form
um and they may even be so generous as
to give a range so your elbow does not
have to be x degrees
we have noticed the best players can be
between an x and y degrees so you have
some play room there so you feel free to
use your own ingenuity to
make it 30 degrees instead of 37 degrees
if you wish
um and they call that coaching their
problem is
that when the individual assumes that
posture when the individual has the
right arm at the correct range of
degrees in the left knee at the correct
range of degrees the ball doesn't go
fast and they begin to wonder why is
that well the ball never went fast
because of the arm and the leg
if if if someone if someone simply this
is
an example someone which just simply
stands there raises their right arm for
the appropriate degree and then bends
their left knee
and there's nothing inside of them
there's no muscular contraction there's
no flexing there's no
uh intent
he's just a scarecrow he's a statue
who looks perfect on video who looks
perfect on the instruction screens
but there's no
relevance there
now if you take this to varying degrees
and in various forms this is how this is
what this is what is called coaching
coaching is cosmetics and form
coaching is taking the
um so-called best players and then
creating an average out of them and
making others adhere to what they do
the interesting thing is if one listens
if one reads a book by a great player in
sports for instance and says i did this
and i did that and then the individual
who reads the book goes and copies that
he never gets the results well if he did
then everybody would be tiger woods
everybody would be a roger federer by
reading a book so that never happens
and the reason it doesn't happen is
because
interestingly what the individual thinks
he does is not what he actually does
he is describing his feels and he may
say that i i do this
but in actuality to something else now
there's nothing wrong with that he can
say whatever he wants to say because at
the end of the day he isn't reading his
own book
he isn't suffering
the person who suffers is the one who
reads his book because the one who reads
his book
will say well so well he's a great
player and he said that he does this
well he's not stupid and therefore you
know if it's as the coaches will always
say well if it's good enough for him
it's good enough for you
so you should go do that
and and this is the level of
intelligence this is a level of logic
this is
the level of depth of knowledge
or lack thereof that these people have
it isn't that that they're not capable
of intelligence they are
but this is a nepotistic society
form and cosmetics is the order of the
day in everything if you go to if you
want to become uh if you want to achieve
peace let's say and the meditation
instructor will come by the whole gang
will come and say okay well if you want
to achieve peace then well you have to
meditate and let me show you how to
meditate you sit down and half lotus and
then what you do is this and then you
put your
your ring and your or your index and
your thumb together and you
say ohm and that creates a vibration and
then you watch your breath and then you
watch your thoughts then you do this for
x number of okay
uh
once again there's nothing inside
these are all like oranges in which just
the shell of the orange is there and
when you open it up nothing's inside
this is what coaching is
therefore the individual
coaching actually
no one should be excited to coach
because that's an invitation to
destruction the person who's excited to
coach
has no idea what he's doing because what
he is excited to do is to
dump his knowledge upon the individual
in the hopes that he can get an ego
boost from the individual doing well yes
along with the ego boost i'm sure he
genuinely wants the individual to do
well and that's fine there's no evil
there um
but in actuality what should be going on
is
and what isn't going on
is the fact that
that individual may be the only
individual in the world who does things
in a completely different manner and in
fact
who do people go to see
those who are like everybody else or
those who are rare and unusual
but the rare and unusual will be eaten
alive by the coaching industry
because he will not adhere to the form
his elbow will not bend at the x degrees
it'll be
40 degrees off
therefore he'll be a casualty of the
coaching of the coaching world
the truth is there is no average and the
the attempt to look at best the best
so-called best players and then create
an average of them and look at their
form and write down numbers and angles
of their body parts is is
really beyond
uh
just it is beyond idiocy that there's
just no words for uh
how a human being a human organism can
sink so low and to know so little
as to demean and insult the potential of
a unique
human being
who has his own fingerprint whose own
potential way of doing things um who is
roboticized that's why you see in sports
today in sports they have devolved in
major ways
the the the money has gone up but the
talent level may have gone up but the
performances there's there's parity in
everything
and that's because of the nepotism of
coaching
business coaching is the same way
this is here's the method by which you
should do it but genius is not
prescribed to a method
or subscribe to a method
genius follows no method in fact genius
doesn't even know how he it does it
it comes from
some unknown place and in fact it is
precisely that unknown place that the
world is thirsty and hungry to see
no one is really looking to see a
well-coached human being
besides the coaches
the olympic coaches the
professional sports coaches the
multi-billion dollar industry of
business coaching and
life coaching and executive coaching
um that's what it all is
it is essentially coaching form in
various shapes and fashions
to show up with a briefcase and this is
what we will do and this is what we i've
done in the past and this is how you
should do it and
nothing is really centered around
uh the individual
everything is centered around
i know something you do not therefore
let me impart my knowledge to you so
that you can get better and in fact even
the idea of better or better is one of
the
holy grails and commandments of coaching
better it's not a place
what does better mean
when you leave your house in the morning
you drive your car do you drive one mile
and tomorrow you drive two miles and
then next week you drive four miles
therefore now you're better now you're a
better driver because you drove further
what does better mean
it has nothing
that the coaching industry says has any
meaning
like all like everything else it is just
like spirituality if you practice
mindfulness you'll get that
very well look for yourself i mean
millions are practicing mindfulness
where have they gotten everything is a
scam
and the reason everything is a scam is
that it isn't meant to be an ill intent
but you have to understand where these
people are coming from where are these
people plucked from they are plucked
from society
and what is society composed of
societies composed of those who do not
seek truth
therefore if there's a pool of
individuals a pool of people called
society
virtually none of whom have devoted
their life to truth maybe one
maybe three
then it is from that pool the coaches
are
arising
therefore by definition
any vocation that these people practice
any organization that they create
any industry that they forge
is based upon untruth
because the composition of that society
of that institution is by those who do
not seek truth therefore one should not
say that they will not seek coaching
they can seek whatever they want
i am not here to help someone make the
right decision
i don't care what anyone does
it's up to them if one wishes
then they will look into the fact that
coaching
is virtually guaranteed to destroy their
life
it is
and those who succeed with coaching are
the same thing as those who succeed with
school
events i think because of it
they succeed despite it
namaste
all coaching
is over coaching
a discourse
one must see this through the eyes of
the truth
words are used in their
colloquial meanings
words are used
according to the image that is most
prevalent in one's mind
when that word is uttered
therefore technically in this particular
context someone could call
anything coaching
and generally human beings will be
disingenuous and they will try to find
exceptions
and they will try to find
the most peripheral branch
to grab and say
well isn't
x
coaching isn't the fact that one even
opens his mouth coaching
and
that disingenuous that disingenuousness
is for the unserious it's from the
unserious
because the only point they are trying
to get across is that
coaching
is necessary so let me find
the most broadest possible definition
in order to refute this
and if in their own mind they manage to
refute it
what has it done besides
validate their own insincerity so
all things
that i speak of are really only for
about
perhaps four people in the world
because human beings are fundamentally
unserious and insincere
therefore they play word games
and they are here just for a showdown or
some kind of debate
but what this means is that
coaching
the very image that pops into one's head
here
is
do this and do that coaching the very
word to coach
someone
is to tell him to do this and not to do
that
the very essence of coaching
that
it it is the very word is pregnant with
the meaning
to coach someone
the problem with coaching
is that because it is only done in a
prescriptive manner
it cannot be otherwise and the reason it
cannot be otherwise in a practical sense
is because human beings know nothing
besides prescriptions
that's all the coach was taught to do
that's all he's going to know
the very fact that a coach who doesn't
prescribe his
um
ludicrous
than a while he coach if he has nothing
to
so everything is based upon prescribing
that isn't a rule that's being broken
the trouble with that is the effective
that is
is that a human being's greatness can
never be revealed
by telling him to do this and not to do
that because the this is and the that's
that he is told to do and not to do are
based upon tradition are based upon
prior experience are based upon the
coach's own experience
and every human being's experience is
limited
because every human being only lives one
life and in that one life they only come
across
x
content and number of people
in that one life they only come across
x content and number of concepts
therefore all that they know
is their own belief in opinion
perhaps
supported by
some modicum of evidence that might have
worked here
or there
in other words coaching is not truth
it is based upon limitations
therefore all things are dependent upon
who the human being is and what he
really wishes to achieve
and if he wishes to become a legend
there is no way that he can be coached
into becoming one
now one may lou use the word legend in a
very loose fashion
which often he has done these days since
mediocrity is the order of the day even
in professional sports and even at the
highest levels of business
the
the degradation of all things towards
mediocrity
is commonplace
in fact it's
is the
prevalent state of affairs in society
so to coach someone
fundamentally is to know what is best
for them
and no human being knows
what is best for another human being
even if
they are experienced in that field
once again they are experienced their
experience is limited by their
experience
so they are not omniscient
therefore there's a cost
a very massive cost
so the very fact that all coaching is
prescriptive
in that very
moment
makes it
a massive limitation
and since
the very nature of coaching is to
prescribe
one can only have his greatness coached
out of him
even if he manages to become great
the coaching does not make him great he
becomes cool he becomes great despite
the coach the question then becomes
the question that has never asked
because people will say well i wasn't
so and so coached and he became great
the questions ever asked is who could he
have become if he was not coached
human beings overcome
and they become despite
education
not because of it
therefore
nothing is right and nothing is wrong
and
if questions are posed
which say well isn't x coaching it isn't
y coaching the only reason that that
question is asked is so that
they in their mind can bring the sigh of
relief to say
okay well at least something can be
cooked that's the only reason that
question is being asked isn't it isn't a
natural desire to learn what is truly
being said and not nor should there be
you don't need to learn what is truly
being said this is for very few people
this is for the truly sincere who want
to learn
not because they should it isn't good
for you
it isn't proper it isn't recommended
it is simply a human being being with a
particular dna
and then people will will ask
well isn't what you do coaching
the honest answer is i have no idea what
it is that i do
but and it isn't a good thing or a bad
thing but
i don't really coach anyone
one once again one could use it in the
broadest sense and say well listen
that coaching one could even say isn't
this
talk coaching
um
so one can turn anything into anything
and therefore
it is for that reason that
sincerity is of the utmost
importance because if it is not present
then it is just a
empty question answered fiasco
of the insincere playing word games
because they don't want they don't have
any interest in the topic and they
simply want to get past the words so
that they can validate that coaching is
is in fact necessary and let me be the
sigh of relief and have coaching in a
usable sentence where
aha i have found one instance in which
coaching is
valuable so
those
questions will not be answered
namaste
guidance
a discourse
to ask a question which says
i have two choices
which road should i take
i have two options i have two things
that i'm thinking about
can you tell me which
one i should choose
that is not a real question
it must be understood that there are no
correct answers
in order for guidance to be given
in this particular domain
there must be heartfelt sincerity
sincerity is not a must
but if it is not present
there is no point in speaking
general questions about how do you calm
the mind
how do i do this
anything that is prescriptive
is not
sincere therefore that can there can be
no guidance
namaste
all things
are empty
a discourse
the things that a human being deems as
significant
in the end are insignificant
and they are not insignificant in some
cosmic way
the human being
comes to see
that they are insignificant
the things that one places faith in
fail him
the things that one relies upon
desert him
the people the places
the thoughts the ideas the concepts
the notions the books
all things fail a human being
except for the truth
the truth is the only thing that does
not fail a human being
the truth is the only thing that does
not end up being empty
all things in a human being's life are
empty
it would be a mistake
to attempt to imbibe this
it would be a mistake to try to believe
this
for belief and opinion
are the enemy of truth
he who asks the question
well what about this
is this empty too
well what about this
is this not significant
this person does not ask a true question
he is simply trying to find exceptions
and the reason that he
searches for exceptions is because he
views all things are empty as a rule
and there are no rules
there is nothing to believe
no one should believe my words
for i have zero interest in convincing
anyone
i have zero interest in debate or
discussion
the person who raises his hand and asks
or in any way intimates or implies that
they believe that something is
significant
that they have
that they have found something that
is not empty
and wishes to discuss it with me
as if to convince me
i have no interest in such things
a person is free to believe that
anything is significant
a person is free to believe
that things are not empty
i have no interest in your beliefs or
your opinions
i have no interest in your ideas
i have no interest in your concepts
i have no interest in anyone's interest
in discussing things
and i have no interest in you valuing my
words
all things
are empty
namaste
earn your books
a discourse
this does not mean that you should
this means is that for the person who's
under
under an obsession
or an extreme longing to discover the
truth
it cannot be found through prescriptive
means
the trouble with books
is that books keep
a human being on the hook
it keeps him chasing
those who write
the books
are trying to get across messages
trying to convince and convey
and in this convincing
there is an extreme beholdenness to
providing
how to's and methodologies
this one this keeps one forever in
ignorance
one could read a thousand books
it will not get him
to where he longs to go
every human being is longing
every human being
craves
something
and that's something ultimately
in the ultimate sense
is the same for everyone
whether one calls it peace or
realization freedom
good luck enlightenment
bliss wisdom
nirvana whatever it may be
every human being is looking
for that
every human being is looking for
something real
yet following something that is unreal
books are unreal
methods are unreal
and this is precisely why the human
being chases
for his or her entire life
and while there is nothing at all wrong
with chasing
chases lead only to more chases
burn your books does not mean that you
should
or that you should not
it is the realization for the one who
was ready
the truth
cannot be found
through methodologies
convincingness
or prescriptive means
any questions that may arise regarding
those who wish not to burn their books
there is no reason to ask such a
question
for there is no compulsion to burn your
books
is not recommended
if you wish to keep your books
it is fine
burn your books
to the truth
not a recommendation
namaste
another dimension of living
a discourse
there is another dimension of
living which is beyond that which human
beings
face and experience
in their traditional lives
there's a dimension that goes beyond
everything that human being is used to
it is beyond
the judgment of oneself
is beyond conflicts
with interpersonal relations
poses the typical human life
any questions about it can only come
from the standpoint
of a traditional human existence
for one
one might ask
he is asking from the play
one dimension
and therefore the answers that he reside
he will not be able to
because he exists on the other side
and the questions which call that side
of the wall
can only be heard by answers
that also exist on that side
every question you chase every question
to the attainment of pleasure which is
the only thing that the human being
knows
how to get more
how to become more
how to become happy
sorrowful
to give someone
taking
it's to try to help someone become happy
it's
more of his traditional life it is
simply to
extribit his
chases
there exists
a different dimension
which is
for more of the gods
of the traditional
dominican the traditional domestic law
can only provide so much and
even at that it provides very little
most of his existence takes from a human
being a normal societal and worldly way
of living
the way of thinking the way of viewing
is simply a pool of pain
disappointment
uncertainty anxiety
fear
to jump up on a question which says how
do i end to seek a prescription
in order to feel better
what gets through gets through
and if something spawns an immediate
question
the truth has not gotten through
there is a different dimension of living
which is beyond what the human being is
which is what the human being was
ultimately
meant for
there is a different dimension
questions will be
allowed
some may receive a response others will
not
no one needs to elevate their
consciousness
these things have no meaning these are
just
uh
words from the spiritual
jargon that
has been released in the society like a
poison
no one needs to
elevate themselves into a higher way of
being
namaste
a life that is uncommon
a
discourse examines it from the
standpoints of
events and circumstances
and then he grades it according to
the positive and the negative things
that are happening to him
this is a very small life
this is an entirely limited examination
[Music]
and
such a thing is not living
at all
there is no compulsion to live
there is no rule or law which takes that
one must live
in a certain way
but rarely one may wish to examine
why is it that they're here
not from the standpoint of purpose
or meaning
but from the standpoint
of the nature of their daily existence
the human being ends up living his life
in order to
do chores
domesticity is
in many ways
a criminal affront
against the natural state of a human
being
and while from a practical perspective
things do need to be done in order to
live in this world
things that may be
rather routine
some human beings
imaginations
tend to drift towards
the possibility of what it may be like
to pursue and or explore
life that is uncommon
and commonness
is perhaps the
[Music]
greatest error of all
as always it is never related to what
should one do
and what is the proper way to live
there are no such distinctions and there
are no such definitions
[Music]
and those who tell people how to live
and what is proper and what is correct
and what is incorrect and what is right
and wrong
and what is holy and unholy and healthy
and unhealthy
such things only make one into more of a
cardboard cut out
than he already is
then instead of being
his own version of a cardboard cut out
he then becomes perhaps a more
proper or healthier version of a
cardboard cut out
rarely does one examine what the rare
person does
what is his life
what is it that he does every day
not that he should be doing something
different
not that he should be doing more of this
or less of that
but what is the difference between
the way he is living now
and having already died
the human being is alive only on
clinical sense
but it is the human being
who searches for a life
that is beyond simply the clinical
that has a possibility
a person wakes up he does chores
he or she works makes money
buys things makes deals
carries out
his or her responsibilities
then the day
ends then one retreats to a bed
and goes to sleep
and does it again the next day
and a cosmetic way
to
view what was just said would be to say
that one should have more fun and one
should take more breaks and one should
take more vacations
and want to live a happier life and not
be so work oriented and gain more
work-life balance but in looking at it
this way that would just be more
more chores
taking a break
from something implies that the thing
that is being taken a break from is not
worth doing
and taking a break to do something
pleasurable is
simply a short-lived
treat
and if one
recognizes that he or she within moments
or days
is about to once again return
to the
doldrums of what use is the break
it is simply a prolonging of the
inevitable so
work life balance and all of these
things are once again
an example
of society's ways of putting
band-aids and plastic patches on things
the real questions are never asked and
the real things we've ever explored
explored
it would be incorrect to assume that
what is being said is that one should
live his or her life
that one should gain more happiness
whatever one gleans from this they lean
whatever the words create
inside of a human being they create
there is no prediction of what they
might create and there is no hope that
they should create x or y
these words are simply being spoken
the rare person examines his life
not in order to improve himself
but because he finds that something is
forever missing
and something is missing in everyone's
life and it's
the same thing
and giving that thing a name
may be a matter of debate
but whether one is rich or poor
famous or unknown
the thing is missing in everyone
therefore a serious person
examines
what that thing is
not to give it a name
but because he cannot help but to
examine it
[Music]
to follow prescriptions of betterment
and to improve one's
outlook
and to better one's habits
these are all swirling muddy water
for a while they may provide
an uptick
in the number of doses of perhaps
happiness that one may gain
no sooner do they arrive than they are
gone once again
the world tells the human being what he
should and should not do
and because the because the human being
spends his life
following these tenets
ideals concepts and prescriptions
he or she never truly has the occasion
or the intent
to explore their life
not from the standpoint of success not
from the standpoint
of gain
but in order to discover the essence of
things
in order to discover
a cure for things similar to discover
a permanent way out
of the confusion
and the misery
and all the sufferings
that are replete within a human being's
life
there is nothing to do
and there is nothing that one should
learn
for to do and to learn
implies an ulterior motive
and the ulterior motive is forever
short-lived
therefore it has no currency
the land of sincerity provides no
definitions
no land of seriousness
contains no prescriptions
namaste
the reason that humans fail
a discourse
is because they seek instruction
instead of seeking the truth
when siddhartha went into the forest
the ascetics
who greeted him
and became his teachers
were already sitting in meditation
and doing complex austerities for many
years before he had arrived
yet they had come nowhere close to
enlightenment
therefore if enlightenment
was contained
within the act of meditation
then these people were experts
yet they did not reach it
this is the same for all human beings
human beings
spend their lives failing
in almost everything
it does not mean that they never taste
success
they do taste success
some of them
and even the ones who do taste success
they fail
in the part of their life that they
actually seek
and long for the most
so failure
it's not falling down
failure is never having reached the goal
ever
and the reason that that happens
is that a human being
is always looking
for something to do because he has been
conditioned by the concept
and by the notion
that there is something that if he does
correctly
it will lead him to success
but
he does not use even simple logic
and simple logic would state that since
he is being given that information that
others are as well
he is not hearing that information from
an ascetic
or a master
at 27 000 feet in the himalayas he is
hearing that from
some ordinary coach or
priest or pundit or
speaker or author or whatever it may be
and whoever he heard it from
that same individual has told the same
thing to many others
and yet they also are feeling just like
him
therefore if
there was truth in the words
then the effect would have been success
in whatever the domain
happens to be
but the human never connects those basic
basic dots
he never comes to the realization on his
own that
success
in its ultimate form
simply cannot arise
not because
i say it doesn't matter what i say
but simply by his own
deductive capabilities simply by his own
basic level of intelligence
that if what everyone's saying worked
then most people would be successful
it doesn't get simpler than that
but the conditioning is so complete
the brainwashing
is so deep
that such a question is never asked
such a concept is never
questioned
and one continues on in their life
in a robotic fashion
under the motivational
power of hope
that maybe if they try yet one more
thing that might work
and the trouble is
that a human only has so many years to
live
so at some point the question must be
asked how long will you continue to do
something
while receiving
failure after failure
the human doesn't have an answer for
that question because quite honestly
even if he abandoned the practice
even if he abandoned the prescriptions
that he was given
he has nowhere else to go
he would simply replace them with a new
prescription
therefore there's no reason for him to
stop
if success were prescriptive
then everybody would be a success
if a success book
produced
success
why would more than one
need to be published
if a success book or a motivational book
or a habits of successful people book or
whatever you want to call it
that's that sells millions and millions
of copies
and that means that it should have
produced millions and millions of
successes
this is not
abstract thinking
it's one plus one equals two
and if the book does not produce that
then that means the book has no value
now people will come back and say what
they always say well just because the
books had to do something doesn't mean
that the person who read the book
actually went out and did the work
very well
but a percentage
just by odds alone
would have done the work
so forget
forget the 90 what about the 10 percent
did they become a success
did the aesthetics
who
created and guided so-called guided
siddhartha
or attempted to guide him towards
enlightenment did they themselves
enlightenment
and even if they didn't
were they able to coach
siddhartha towards enlightenment
now how
how this will oftentimes be heard is
as a slight
against the ascetics or a slight
against the motivational speakers and
authors
it isn't the slight at all
there's simply evidence
here's a key
put the key in the lock
did the key work
no
so to say that the key doesn't work
is not an insult against the key
that's just basic evidence there's no
reason to call it a bad key or an evil
key
or a malevolent key
the key simply didn't work
but humans do not look at things in this
way
because they're occupied
they're occupied
by action
by taking action
they will do this
and they will do that
and they will log how many hours they
did it
and they will become proud of the number
of hours they did it
because
they are at every point in their life
the human being
is subscribing to ideals
he is trying to live up to bumper
stickers
you must work hard
nothing wrong with working hard
but his
is working hard the question
does a person get paid for working hard
or does he get paid for results
no one will say
well hard work leads to results
very well don't believe me look at the
evidence
how many people are out there working
like dogs and slaves
with nobility
in sincerity working and working
working three and four jobs
have they become a success
in fact you could very correctly say
that they work harder
than many people who are
multi-millionaires
so is working hard
lead to success
well then someone will say see
everyone's got a clever answer because
no human being is looking for the truth
so these all these like to play word
games
not sincere people no one is sincere
he's just a word game player because
there's a reason for that
the human being will fight to the death
in order to maintain the status quo
so they will send they will say
yes fine very well working hard does not
lead to success but sitting home and
watching tv well not either
well
quite honestly there are many people who
sit down and watch tv and make millions
when the market goes up they make
millions when the market goes down they
make millions
does that mean that one should work hard
no
does that mean that one should not work
hard no
does that mean that one should gentleman
watch tv no
then what does it mean
it means that if a person
lives up to ideals
he will fail
if a person lives up to ideals
he will fail
because ideals work only in books
the world of reality
is far more grainy
uncertain
non-linear
but in a book book
and in
speeches
everything is a it's a it's a captive
audience it's a vacuum
the speaker says this and every seven
minutes he tells a joke and the audience
laughs and
then they all go home and
fail again
the person they want to ask himself how
many speeches of gurus has he been to
how many thousands of books has he read
how many quotes of famous scientists
has he heard
what has anything done for him
where has anything in his life gotten
him
but the human doesn't want to look there
he wants to look
and be proud of the fact that he read
books
he's always looking for a way to feel
good about himself
that isn't a good thing or a bad thing
it doesn't mean that one should feel bad
about themselves but that isn't the
question
the question is did it lead you to
success
it wasn't about how good of a person you
are it wasn't about your morality it
wasn't about how hard you worked it was
about how many books you read no one
cares
nor should they
i am shocked that school still exists
why would anyone hire anyone because of
their grades in school what does that
have to do with anything in the real
world
unless you're going to be a professional
exam taker
what does school have to do with
anything that's laughable
and this is exactly and precisely what
happens
when when a human being lives his life
according to concepts and ideals instead
of the truth
and therefore
the inevitable result is failure and why
would it not be
the result doesn't care about the ideal
and the result does not bow at the altar
of concepts
the result does not care what the world
thinks of him the result does not attend
the motivational speeches
the result did not attend the guru's
lectures
the result is a result
but humans do not think this way
they are too busy feeling good about
themselves or attempting to
gathering consolation prizes of hard
work
and being well read
what does it mean to be well read you've
read the words of others
why does that make why is that something
to be proud of
to the original to create something
there's far more value in that
than imbibing and regurgitating
second-hand words of others
the human does not recognize what
society has done to him
and his entire life is a slavery
to it
in society
imprisons human beings through concepts
you should meditate why
if you do you do if you don't you don't
but for what purpose
now my the things that i speak of and
the things that i write about
are not for the common man
therefore it must be implicit and it
must be understood that everything i say
isn't meant for the common man
so for instance the person who does
meditation in order to gain five minutes
of peace
i'm not gonna address that person i'm
not even going to acknowledge that
because that's that's fine but that's
not who i who i'm speaking to nothing
wrong with that
but that isn't my audience
so when i say enlightenment is
meaningless i mean with regard to
reaching somewhere of magnificent
significance
or i say meditation
is meaningless
i'm speaking with regard to reaching
somewhere of magnificent
significance so society creates all
these
scenarios and all of these concepts all
these ideals
and all these words and bumper stickers
and it's pasted all across the sky
and the human like a robot
attempts to imbibe and to follow and to
live up to all of these things
but none of these things have meaning
the vast majority of the world fails
so why would anyone follow any
instruction that is addressed to the
masses
if the masses are not who they want to
be
any reasonable minded individual would
reject that first
not based upon belief or faith or in
what i say but based upon basic
kindergarten level evidence
based upon first grade logic
does it work
if it doesn't
it does not matter how many ideals and
how good you feel about yourself
it is trash
and that's where it belongs
unless
the person doesn't care about success
that's a whole other matter
and let it pertain to anything that i
write about
namaste
in a valuable life
a discourse
if one is able to avoid the pitfalls
of societal conditioning which are
difficult to impossible to avoid for the
vast majority
the pitfalls on judgment the pitfalls of
prescription
the pitfalls of
replacing one thing with another
the pitfalls of self-improvement and
self-development and new age and
spirituality
these are not small
hurdles
a direct pure and genuine examination
of the value of one's life
what does he do all day
what does she do all
day what does one do
aside from
so-called work
and even in one's work
is it simply work
or is it devotion
not that it should be devotion
it is an examination
once again there is no judgment
if one examines their life in this way
if one is sincere and if one is serious
in their examination
they may discover something
they may discover something of great
value
it may be for the first time in their
life that they were sincere
when no one was watching
when there were no pets on the back to
be had
this
is a worthwhile life
the serious person
who explored in this way
has the opportunity to produce a truly
valuable life
a life
that stops taking from him all that he
has
and all humans feel whether they express
it or not
whether they admit it or not
that life has taken everything from them
and if everything is not yet gone it is
slowly on the move
but if one can find something there's a
lasting value
that does not leave
that is substance
that has the opportunity to lead one to
permanence
and provide for them
at least a fraction of what they have
always longed for
then they have the opportunity
to create a valuable life
namaste
what a person becomes
is what he exposes himself to
a discourse
it is about understanding it isn't
beating oneself up or not getting it
nor is it
patting oneself on the back
it's understanding how things work and
what a person becomes
is what he exposes himself to
this is the power of exposure therefore
one must be very systematic and one must
be very
surgical in what they expose themselves
to therefore if a human being
one of the
truths in life then they would find a
domain which gives them that truth or
the closest thing to it and expose the
and expose their brain to it on a
regular basis but that isn't what
happens
instead the human beings expose them to
prescriptions and societal jargon and
concepts and theories and religion and
spirituality
and
positive
talk and self-help and self-development
and all of these things
which don't get anyone anywhere because
they're not truth they're simply a bunch
of doings
therefore be comforting to know
that if a thing doesn't if a thing
doesn't work it's because it doesn't
work that way therefore there's no
mystery there if one wishes to become
warm
and he enters an ice bath it's
comforting to note that that shouldn't
be a mystery that he didn't become warm
there is a laid
dictionary definition
truth is that which is non-prescriptive
truth is that which is fundamental
indivisible reality and every situation
has a truth every topic has a truth
therefore truth is not divorced
from the reality of business and sport
and life whatever it may be
it is involved in the deepest grainy
reality of everyday life and everything
in fact it is untruth that has no basis
in anything
namaste
you have wasted your entire life
but it's
okay a discourse
what does the it's okay mean well it's
okay means that
um there's no reason to be frenetic
about it
and there's no reason to try and feel
good about it
because if you try to feel good about it
[Music]
you'll just taste your own tail
if you become frenetic about it
what is the freneticism going to do
is the freneticism going to take you
somewhere
to where you stop wasting your life
so any reaction that you have is
irrelevant that's what it's okay means
it's okay also means
that up until now you've wasted your
entire life
but tomorrow is going to be the same as
today so it isn't like today is going to
be the last day you waste your life
and from now on things are going to be
different
nothing is going to be different
because if something is going to be
different
there it would have been different
different from
at least the middle if not the beginning
now sure there's a possibility that
there's a rare individual who has not
heard this information before and
therefore he is exposed to
a truth that perhaps he has
resonated with
uh tonight and
this takes
this produces a shock to the system
and sends him veering off on a an
entirely different course sure that's
possible that's that's pro that's
possible
that possibility can never be denied
but for
virtually a hundred percent of the
individuals listening to this
um the it's okay means that it's
nothing's going to change
uh
because you're you're the reason is that
your love of socialization your
your interest in
your iphones
your
passion for
the societal ways of doing things
be trying to impress your friends and
co-workers the
binge-watching television serials
the following one prescription and
how-to and method and hack
after another
be trying to better yourself through
self-help books and spirituality
be practicing meditation mindfulness and
various different austerities in order
to
become more spiritual or more better
none of which mean anything
all of those things are not going to
change
they're not going to change not because
you should change them
or because you're
doing it wrong they're not going to
change because
within you is an undeniable belief that
those those things actually mean
something
uh and because you're attached to the
idea of meaning and purpose
um spirituality in society and self-help
and self-development and the gurus and
the motivational speakers
and the priests and the pundits and the
best-selling books and the authors and
the media and everything
has done a number on you that is so
complete
so unwavering
and practically irreversible
that it's just complete
there's no coming back
the assault is simply too great and the
conditioning is too deep
therefore you will continue to waste
your entire life and what does it mean
to waste a life a waste of life means
that you have wasted an opportunity not
that and nothing that i say should there
be a bread and i should
attached to it
um
it isn't that you should not waste this
opportunity
you shouldn't do anything or should do
anything there's there's no right or
wrong good or bad
with the opportunity to
find truth or realization or understand
who you truly are
but because society has conditioned you
to seek happiness and
pleasure
behind every street corner
your entire day is completely and
utterly devoted
to the search for
small doses of pleasure which you
attempt to gather into large doses
and that becomes your entire life is one
large never-ending
chase
and that will never end
and you will never change
and this is not reverse psychology
because i could not care less if you
change
it isn't about changing
the person who changes changes back
it is about understanding is about
realization
and humans are not
wired that way
because of the societal conditioning
to seek understanding they are wired to
seek prescriptions and how-to's and
methods and techniques
and five-step plans and the latest hacks
from silicon valley gurus
and reading the latest books about
stoicism and the self-important
philosophical nonsense
that everyone wants you to read
and
it is just intellectualism in various
forms
no one ever gets anywhere doing that
they just try to get better so that they
can go to cocktail parties and
demonstrate how many books they've read
and how intellectual they are how smart
they are and see if they can rattle off
a few new quotes that they have read so
that they'll gain social standing in the
social environment and that will never
change
because the human is subservient to his
own ego he's an egoist he seek only to
prolong and adorn
his persona
and because these things are so deep
within the human being
the possibility of that going away is
basically zero
there may be one individual maybe one
and that to to be honest that one
um
that's out there or two or four
are very unlikely to have found
serendipitously this podcast
so therefore there are none
namaste
experts are liars
because they have to be
a discourse
this does not mean to imply any ill
intent
because i do not believe
that the majority of experts have ill
intent
to intentionally misinform
or to lead people in a harmful direction
i do not believe that
at the same time the expert has to lie
because
there is a market only for lies
the number of human beings in this world
who are seeking the truth and any topic
is exquisitely small
therefore
there simply isn't a market for truth
since there is not a market for truth
the expert has no
motive or incentive
to find the truth
because no one is seeking it
what people are seeking are
prescriptions
how to's methods techniques hacks
every day a new article with
the latest hack for x y and z appears
this is what the market's appetite is
this is what the people want
and whatever the people want there is a
demand and a market for
therefore a supply will be created the
expert therefore does not have any
incentive
to find the truth and since he does not
wish to starve by finding something
which
only five people in the world want
then he will bow to the demand
of society
hang up his shingle
and compete with the other
liars therefore all that one hears in
books and media and podcasts and
newspapers and
magazines
and television and
whatever it may be
is by definition all
partial truth or frank untruth because
if it wasn't
nobody would read it and anyone who
wishes to say well i have found
so-and-so experts who are wonderful and
they
gave me truth
good for you i don't i don't buy into
that first of all
something to you that you think is truth
if you believe that you're welcome to
your beliefs
namaste
life problems
a discourse
if one examines the evidence
as this has been done for
thousands of years
the
human beings will listen to the speaker
they will hear what is said
and
they will either implement or not
implement
and if they implement the implementation
will soon lose its motivation
and
if they
whether they lose their motivation or
not
the thing which they are doing will have
a shelf life and then
they will go
to seek more
advice seek more
things to do
and people don't realize this because
they because
the alternative has never been
even considered
it has never been put forth
it is a reflexive
and given tendency
that one comes in order to know what to
do
telling a person what to do to alleviate
their life problems or whatever problems
they may have
it may sound nice
and one may even practice it
but
it does not really need to be said that
it does not work
and the reason that that does not need
to be said is because
there is ample evidence which speaks for
itself
not
even
necessarily
requiring one to look in a global
perspective but just in their own life
if their problems were solved by
listening to a lecture or following
their
the
methods or techniques in a book then
once they had been given those then
their problems should have been solved
and
yet
every human being who is
listening to this and
every human being who is not
has
lived a life of
following things
chasing things doing things practicing
things and it makes logical sense
after all
what is one to do simply
sit and do nothing
human beings are conditioned to act
and they feel that by doing actions they
are getting somewhere because it gives
the
illusion of movement
activity gives one
the feeling that he is doing something
and by doing something
it increases one hope that the
doing of that something will
perhaps lead to
their goal
but truth does not lie in the direction
of what should i do
truth does not
lie
in that direction at all and there is no
need to take
my word for it simply examine one's own
life
it doesn't one does not require
convincing of this
it is
it is certainly
against the grain it is certainly
against everything that a person has
ever been known has ever known and been
taught
however
once mentioned
it becomes clear if one simply examines
their own life without any sort of
scientific inquiry just even a cursory
examination
um within a few seconds one realizes
that
they haven't really gotten anything out
of
practices and methods and techniques and
all the things that the books say and
preachers say and so forth
um
that is of any lasting value
so truth
so truth is not lie in the direction of
i have life problems
and what should i do
about that
it really in fact
it really isn't about seeking relief at
all
and then the spiritualists come in and
the spiritualists say well you should
sit with your problems
and then the person will then turn
will go and do that he'll sit with the
problem
and after he sits for a while the
problem
doesn't go away and therefore he says
well i've sat with it as well and that
doesn't work either and they're correct
because that is a prescription as well
so truth does not lie in the direction
of
give me something that i can do the the
the road to hell is actionable advice
and that is completely and utterly
utterly
savagely contrary to everything that a
human being's ever been taught
one lives a life and many problems
arise
from the devastating to
the minor
and they
continually come
and nothing nothing that i'm saying is
of any
anything that one needs to believe
namaste
truth is the only thing
a discourse
in all things
the only thing there actually is is
truth
there is no belief in opinion
one can have them
but they have no significance
a belief in
an opinion is an attempt
to guess
as to what a thing really is or how
things truly are in reality
for any given situation
the truth lives in that reality the
truth is that reality
but everything else is simply a guess at
that reality
thus is fantasy
and therefore that which is fantasy does
not exist
truth is the only thing there is
there is no religion
religion is an institutionalized
to worship the name of a particular god
spirituality doesn't exist either
spirituality
is simply a bunch of oceans and
hocus pocus
and beliefs and rituals
in order to gain some sense of
peace or well-being
it isn't real
it is fabricated
rituals are fabricated
but truth
whether one knows it or not
whether one comes to realize it or not
is the only thing
there is
and it is the only thing there can be
it is for this reason that the pursuit
of religion
in the pursuit
of spirituality and the pursuit of
self-help
is the pursuit of guessing
is the pursuit of chasing
is the pursuit of attempting
is the pursuit of putting on a blindfold
and growing dart in a particular
direction
in hopes that one strikes the board
there's nothing wrong with it
but it isn't real
then the only question that remains is
if a particular person is interested in
that which is real
or in that which is fantasy
and that's up to each person to decide
for themselves
the namaste
behind living life
a discourse
there is no compulsion to live in a
certain way
there's no compulsion to
be happy or
be kidding
attempting to follow such tense
such rules
it essentially stiffens the human being
and it leads them towards places where
the rules promises are broken
essentially what happens is that the
human being
searches within life
for things that life cannot give
and even knowing and even if one were to
memorize
that truth
it would do nothing for him because it
would not be in his own experience
just because truth is given does not
mean it needs to be forced upon oneself
in time
one may come to realize it or he may not
the human being searches within
relationship
within people within
friendships
whatever it may be
ways to make himself
happy
searches for various things to fill the
hole within himself
and life
is not created in order to fill those
holes because those holes are created by
a lack of understanding
life is very different than what a human
being believes it to be
i think the essence
is to
somehow arrive at the realization
naturally
with any attempt to live according to a
certain ideal or concept
or live up to
or a certain
guru's methodology
to be this or be that or to be happy or
to be
compassionate or to be
joyful whatever it may be
well that is
the road to ruin
because that is not of oneself that is
something that is taken from the outside
put on like a coat
and then
being attempted to live up to
these things don't work and jesus and
this is the truth that human beings have
never understood
and the overwhelming majority of human
beings will never understand that not
for centuries not for eons
it will always be about concepts and
ideals and living a certain way and
doing a certain thing and being a
certain way and changing yourself to
become this or that and being less of
that more of this
and that absolutely ties a human being
in knots number one and even if it
didn't tie him and not it doesn't work
it's a chase
it is all about realizations it is all
about understanding it is all about the
the
natural seriousness to want to
understand
and even the desire and even
understanding is not ideal
there's no such thing like i want to
i want to want to understand that
once again
it doesn't matter if the ideal is good
or bad it's still an ideal it's still a
concept
therefore it is not about
living life in a certain way
it is about seeing the truth behind
things
because if one sees the truth
the more that he sees the truth
the less misconceptions and the
misunderstandings he has and the last
misconceptions
and misunderstandings that he has
unless he will struggle and suffer
because he will
be approaching things according to the
way things are
not
trying to make them a certain way or to
make himself
or herself a certain way
namaste
for he who seeks to be a legend
a discourse
there is no compulsion to be a legend
there's no judgment that one should be
or one should attain supreme greatness
motivation is for hacks
it really comes down to what an
individual himself
is moved to become
there's no external motivation that's
that's all just
mental performance nonsense all the
mental performance coaches of today
they're just dogs they have no clue
about anything related to the mind if
it's an insult
for them to talk about the mind because
they have no clue
mental performance has nothing
whatsoever to do with psychology
psychology
is
child's play
it's wrong
becoming a legend is for an individual
who
has it in his bones
this is not about someone who wants to
become better or
improve or make a little bit more money
you have people who are ceos who built
many businesses and those who are
professional athletes and
almost
none of them are legends
now that doesn't mean that they should
be
it only becomes relevant when an
individual has that desire
and
nothing is being spoken about it because
they seek to truly become one even
though they've already become successful
and they've become
very skilled and attained some level of
notoriety in their field but they
haven't
become supreme
they haven't owned it
and
um
it really
it really is about
it's about the individual
what you see in society today is
uh essentially a bunch of people who are
saying this is how you get better this
is what you do this is what you do and
they take all comers and they give you a
bunch of nonsense and go practice that
and it's it's it's that same way across
all domains from so-called spirituality
to self-help to
performance coaching to mental
performance to sport psychology to
whatever it may be
and what what needs to be understood if
one wishes to understand
is that what
one has to know what they're dealing
with if one recognizes the source then
they don't become blindsided they don't
become
fooled
what is real what
what is available today in the world
is only one thing and which is a bunch
of prescriptions and empty nonsense and
a
you know red and blue pills and
incremental improvements and one percent
better and all of these things it's all
that's available uh legendary status not
available anywhere in fact
i think it's an insult to say that
professional athletes are legends they
are not
they are not
um i think i think
professional athletics has devolved
greatly
like all things in society devolve
there are no legends out there there are
people who they are professional
athletes who are
uh there are some who are
quite above the rest that exists
absolutely
and
those are
those are ones who people could use the
example of being great and and that's
fair
um
but
in all domains from business to
professional
athletics so whatever it may be
the individual who seeks to become a
legend is an individual whose dna is
extraordinarily rare just a desire to
become one
can only come from hey rare dna you know
i'm not talking about although it would
be nice to become i'm not talking about
it would be nice i'm talking about the
individual who truly who lives who
lives and breathes and dies for that's
what he wants and that individual is the
most ignored individual in the world
because there's nothing in the society
that's that's available to him
the only thing that's available in the
society
are for the masses
the only thing that's available in the
society in the world is for the mediocre
the one percent better the do a couple
of this and that and go practice this
and that and do some breathing and do
some imagery that's all that's available
there's no legendary
um
category
for legends doesn't exist
i'm the only one
and there's a reason why it doesn't
exist
because there's no volume
there's no demand
and where there's no demand there's not
going to be a supply and that's and
that's fair that's wise
why would someone create a supply for
which there's no demand
that's
that's proper
um but
so what is it
you know for the rare individual who
seeks to become a legend
what is it
that
allows that to happen well it's the
truth
it's that simple it's the truth
a human being wishes to become x and
then
he goes to all the minions and the
coaches around the world and one person
says this and then the next person says
the complete opposite and the third
person says the opposite of that the
fourth person says this and the fifth
coach says this and
uh they're all just guessing there's no
truth
but if someone gave him the truth and
said i think that there are private
discourses upon this recently
um if someone gave the truth this is the
truth i don't care if you do or you
don't this is just the truth
this is the raw
unadult unadulterated
unvarnished undecorated
unpackaged
truth
then that is
the straightest line there is to
what one seeks in anything
everything else is a chase
so i don't want to hear any questions
about well can you give me a tip i'm not
giving anybody any tips
it really comes down to
the depth
of longing within the individual
the individual
who
for whatever reason whether he already
has that longing or
it has come to him
somehow in
recent
times
or it wasn't there before and now it is
whatever the reason may be
that individual will
be be genuinely interested in nothing
but the truth
none of the bunch of opinions
because he will recognize that
he doesn't have the luxury of wasting
time because not getting there
is not an option for him not because
some coach is trying to motivate him and
said that isn't an option for you but
because in his bones
that's who he is
and it's in he's not good for being that
way
it's you know somebody likes chocolate
somebody else likes vanilla neither is
bad
and that's why there's no compulsion to
become a legend that's why there's no
judgment
that one should
want to become
great that that cannot be forced on
anyone it really comes down to an
individual
wants what he has within him
not to work hard on that
crap
but what he
genuinely wants to become
not because somebody else said so
but because they want to beat some other
person and get some
ego boost
it's all about purity
sincerity
seriousness
devotion
and none of those things are good you
shouldn't do them
if someone asks me should i do that i
would say no don't do it
it would be an insult you are insulting
them you're insulting these truths by
doing them
they don't need you
if
if they arise if the desire for them the
longing for them
arises within you
and it is there
then it's there
namaste
your entire life is a lie
a discourse
upon hearing this
this is not a
a caution
or
a recommendation
or a call to arms
[Music]
or something that
one should feel compelled to go and
change
[Music]
there's there's no compulsion to
jump in the air and say oh no my life is
a lie allow me to go change it
quite frankly
telling someone that their life is a lie
or they're wasting their life or
whatever it may be
the effect that these things have on
people is
negligible
there is the odd and occasional
individual
who
perhaps already feels this way and
therefore this resonates
and thus it
is a reinforcement of something that
perhaps he already feels
and for that reason a resonance occurs
but but there's no
there's no intended
recommendation here that one
should not live a lie
it is simply a statement of
truth
a human being's life is a lie not
because he has done things wrong
but because he has made the wrong
choices or he has
been bad or that he is evil or
that or that he
intentionally is wasteful
his life is a lie because all that he is
swimming in
is lies
from the moment that he came into this
earth all he has heard is lies
and a half truth is a lie
he has been given the bits and pieces of
things he's been given
one
fragment of an overall picture he's been
given
outright lies he's been
told to do this and that he's been
promised that if he
follows this or practices
that
that he will get to x y and z
and he is told that he should do this he
shouldn't do this
and the the entire
picture that has been painted for him
has all been a lie and the source of
those lies is basically all of his
friends
his family all of society
and
in the vast majority of cases
particularly
the closer to home it is be it one's
family or friends or
those who are close to the individual
there is never any ill intent
it is just
that humans do not
seek truth they they've been
conditioned for so long by lies
that they begin to parrot those lies
they begin to
regurgitate those lies when
a human being becomes his environment
and if one lives in an environment of
lies
um the only way that he won't live in
lies is if he is
so adverse
and has such a distaste
for society that
he completely and utterly walks the
other way
upon contact
but such human beings are
practically non-existent they do exist
but
very very rare
humans do not shun society humans
embrace it
humans move toward it
and in doing so they move towards
lies so whatever one thinks
or the cause of his problems or lies
whatever one things are the solutions
to his problems are lies the lies extend
so deep
that even the attempt to solve one's
problems is
has nothing to do with the
the real thing that one is most
effective in in pursuing
even even the pursuit is lies because it
is based upon a false premise if one if
one believes that x is the way things
are then he'll begin to pursue the x
and since x is not the way things are
then his very pursuit
is fundamentally chasing something that
isn't true
and therefore that pursuit leads to
other things and
it is it is one complex lie after
another
nothing is what one believes it to be
nothing is what
it seems to be
all that one thing someone knows are
things that he is
he has imbibed from society
they are not truth
they are lies
this does not mean one should change
this does not mean that
one
should stop living in society this does
not mean that one should wear earplugs
or put cotton in their ears this does
not mean anyone should stop reading
books or stop watching the media or stop
listening to intellectuals or stop
listening to mental models or stop
following prescriptions or stop
following religions or stop following
spirituality or stop following self-help
it doesn't mean anything
it is simply truth
and there's no attempt to convince
anyone of it
namaste
arriving at wisdom
a discourse
some people are naturally more wise than
others
based upon whatever various reasons past
experiences
possibly past lives
dna
whatever it may be
but arriving at wisdom
like arriving at truth
is very much and against the grain
endeavor
because it moves against
the familiarity
and the comfort
and
essentially all of the knowledge that a
person
has held on to and has imbibed
it is contrary to
everything
with the utility of wisdom
and the feeling of wisdom
are things that are irreplaceable
the utility of wisdom is
it leads to an effective life
it leads to a peaceful life
the feeling of wisdom
is
a feeling of
truly knowing
and knowing that is not based upon past
experiences and knowing that is
not based upon didactics or the things
that one has imbibed
through the culture or through the world
is
unknowing of the essence of things
and without wisdom
there is only chasing
there is only failure there is only
movement in circles
it is to move through life never knowing
the truth
it is to move through life revolting
against this and that
and hoping for this and that
never recognizing the essence of things
like all things it is
something that arises from
a deep
logging and a deep connection
and an attraction
which is natural within a particular
individual
for inexplicable reasons
it's
its presence is not questioned
it cannot be said where it comes from
only that
it is there or it is not
it is as far from
science and didactics
and
scholarly efforts
as can be
and it is
acutely necessary
to live a life
a life that exists not of chases a life
that is
not founded upon
hope and belief
and failure
nothing can be more necessary
eventually because of it
they succeed despite it
namaste
it really is all about development it's
all about learning it's all about nuance
it's all about
dissecting you know how you feel and in
what situations
uh and and
what patterns emerge and what things we
can learn and build upon it's all about
building something right everything has
a cause and an effect and we just
examine the effect
and then look at what the cause might
have been
