hi coupled thanks for your time
um so
uh growing up I was always a sensitive
and uh weak kid and so
as I've been getting older closer to my
30s now I've been trying to become
mentally a bit more resilient and
physically more resilient too to kind of
protect myself from the emotional and
physical assaults of the world
um
over the last couple years I felt that
I have become a lot stronger
and physically and emotionally
um but sometimes it still fluctuates and
you know they're
I felt like I haven't arrived at where I
want to arrive so my question to you is
so what is uh what is emotionally
stronger mean I just it really just
means that
um
not letting my thoughts affect me as
much
so to speak like not being submissive
just not submitting to my thoughts and
you know being unstable and running
around emotionally in that way
um and or like if people are
um I don't know if people are like
emotionally assaulting me or bullying me
not letting that
affect me as much as it used to
and how has that been going
it's been going it's been a lot better
in the last five six years or so but
um
still not
where I wanted to be and what does
better mean
um
better would mean for me that it simply
wouldn't
it would bother me less like I wouldn't
care what they were saying like I
wouldn't let that trigger me in any way
and was that done internally by force
um
I'm not sure if it's forceful or not
it's more I mean there's I guess there
is
sometimes there's effort uh
or like just the acknowledgment like oh
you know I let this person affect me
this much and um but I wouldn't say it's
like a force like I'm trying to ignore
the emotion I've tried that before and
I've you know that doesn't work
so what's your question
so my question is
my question is since this is fluctuating
uh does this mean that I'm this is
simply another Chase as opposed to
making a significant or a true arrival
well I mean what I mean what is it what
does it really matter
if it's a Chase or not a Chase
um
because that's why I asked you
those questions what does better mean
where are you now with it what does
stronger mean
um so if I told you it was a Chase
would let's say I said okay it's a Chase
so would you
would you then abandon
the things
that made you feel in your words
emotionally stronger or quote better
would you go back to the
Prior Way
if I said it was a Chase
I don't think I would I think it would
just help me understand so so then so
then it so then if you wouldn't then it
really doesn't matter right right
because what happens is that people
people
um
people what they do is they
they sort of and they do this by habit
that you know nothing is done
you know trying to be sure ignorant or
anything it's just what the world does
to people right I thought their fault
it's not their fault so
you know the world prescriptionizes
right everything so the world the only
thing that's available in the world is
prescriptions like there's no such thing
as uh part of the world doesn't
prescriptionize some experts don't
prescription or other like that doesn't
exist there's only one yeah uh there's
only one thing which is prescriptions
just it's just a matter the only
comparisons are who prescribes what this
guy prescribes this and this person
prescribes that so only the
prescriptions differ but there's no such
thing as no prescription that doesn't
exist right no prescriptions yeah and as
a result when that's the only thing that
a person
has ever known their entire life
um then naturally
logically inevitably when they you know
read what I write and what I talk about
they bring that only tool that they have
with which they've been taught by the
world and they try to turn it they turn
what I write into a prescription and say
oh that's this and oh that's that and I
can't be doing that because that's wrong
and I and I want to stay away from that
because that's wrong and so they make
they make this framework out of it based
upon the tools and the rules that
they've been using in the other domains
of the world and that
that doesn't work in what I do because
um everything that I write about isn't
about
you know what to do what not to do what
to you know it isn't about any of that
so the entire
the entire like planet is different yeah
like I'm not saying it's better or worse
it's some people some people come and
they hate it right it's not for them so
I'm not saying it's better for I'm just
saying it's completely it's a different
it's a different Universe right so
um like all the rules are like their
gravity goes the other way you know what
I mean it's so you need you cannot bring
the tools and the rules from the world
into my domain because they won't work
and so when you say is it a Chase
what your
what you're sort of doing without
necessarily recognizing it is
you know you've turned Chase into this
don't do thing right oh I see you've
turned it into you right you've said oh
that's bad yeah yeah so now and I and it
isn't like I use chases in a good way I
yes when I say to chase I'm not saying
it's a good or a bad thing I I I
literally am saying that chase is you
know lead back to themselves and they're
a circle and they don't really go
anywhere but but that's
but but that doesn't you'll never get to
that by playing the rules game right
you'll never like I never got to that by
saying oh uh don't chase because yeah
that's bad right like that's a bad right
I never played the prescription game so
uh so when you when you look at the word
Chase and you turn it into a
prescription
then it has no meaning because then
you're and it's and it's the same thing
with prescriptions you know people come
and they say oh you're saying no first
of all I don't I didn't say no
prescriptions I said I said they don't
work but I also said four million times
that you shouldn't believe me
uh yeah I also said four million times I
don't believe what I say examine things
for yourself
because it's only if you examine things
in your own experience and because even
prescriptionizing your whole entire life
so you have a lot of data to mine you
have a lot of experiences under your
belt to provide evidence for that you
can go through and see okay did they
work for me or not and if they did great
go ahead and keep doing it
um so it's it isn't about
prescriptionizing it and that's why I
asked about those things because they
were practical
if you're in a place which is what you
find to be superior
to the place that you used to be
then like don't make like why
prescriptionize anything and then that's
why I asked you
would you go back to the old place and
you said no yeah okay well that it
doesn't matter right so it's about
practicality it's about
it's about
um reality
um it isn't about turning things into
do's and don'ts and goods and bads and
positives and negatives and
prescriptionize this and that and that's
just a habit you know that was created
in the world
and then it was sort of brought over
here right
okay understood thank you
sure
fear of success and that resonated with
me because it feels like that's exactly
where I am
for context I met a lot of successful
people in my life and one thing that I
found that was very common
is that they all seemed
trapped in some way quite literally by
the trappings of success and one of the
worst aspects of that seemed to be the
the ego of being successful which just
seemed to wreak all kinds of havoc in
their lives
so if you would could you please talk
more about the
characteristics of the fear of success
I'm not necessarily interested in
changing it but my sense is that if I
understand it then whatever change needs
to happen will happen on its own
thank you well you speak of the ego of
success as if ego is limited to the
domain of success everything is the ego
of everything
if you look at the spiritualists what
are they doing they're having meditation
contests so it's the it's the if they're
having how long can you burn the incense
and how long can you meditate and how
long can you hold your breath and how
long can you watch your thoughts so it's
you know you know how quickly can you
shave your head it's everything is the
ego of everything so you know to isolate
success and say it's full of trappings
what isn't full of a trapping you know
you just being alive is full of
trappings it's all full of trap it's all
a trap everything that you think is a
trap everything about you is a trap so
even if you never tasted success it's
nothing but trap it's a trap before
success during success after success in
the absence of success it's all a trap
360 all the way around 24 7 for your
entire life until you learn the truth
um yeah I think up here for your time
um
I think I'm starting to understand more
and more or that
um
that the only way out is the moment and
I want to ask
what prevents a human being to
be constantly engaged in whatever one is
doing
being mesmerized by the world
