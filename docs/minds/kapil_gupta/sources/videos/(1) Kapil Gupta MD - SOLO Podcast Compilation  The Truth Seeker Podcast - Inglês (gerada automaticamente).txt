the title of this solo podcast is
wild freedom
the story of attachment
you know i wish the buddhists
and
those who
claim to be
truly committed
to helping humanity
with
the problems of a human being's life
were actually as committed as they claim
because they are in a real position
to truly
change people's lives
and
instead of being sincere and genuine
in both their pursuit
and the
revelation
of this truth
about the fundamental nature of the
problems of life
they
enter into a world of culture and
prescription
and
if they themselves succumb to
what
the rest of society succumbs to
then
what they do is simply another detail
and another example
of that which society does
and they're supposed to be the ones who
help man escape from
the binds
of society and the
imprisonments of himself
that i think is the real
crime
um
the
the human beings who devote themselves
or who claim to devote themselves
uh
really have
allowed themselves to succumb
like everyone else
and so they're just as common as the
common man
so how can they
truly
help human beings out of the quicksand
it's really a shame
um
when you hear things like attachment and
when you about attachment and
about
the pains of life and
about anxieties and fears and
all of the
um
pains
that a human being suffers in his
life um
he goes to the internet or he goes to
books or he
uh
goes to temples and
monasteries
in search of
the truth
about a genuine way out of these things
so that
he can
live
a free and a whole
life
but what he gets
is
patronization
he gets
well just go in the corner and meditate
and be mindful and practice loving
kindness
and you'll get over it
um it's
it's frankly insulting and
i think that is the most egregious of
crimes
is a person who is put into the position
or claims to be in a position to truly
help humanity
you know if a heathen does so then
that's understandable because he's a
heathen
but if someone who claims to be put into
a position to truly help humanity
if that person succumbs
to the same patronization
uh
academics
minutia
and
empty jargon that
the intellectuals
pursue
then
he commits the biggest crime
because he was truly claiming to be in a
position of help
so
like anything else that i've discovered
in life
if you truly want the truth about
something
there's no one who can help you if you
want prescriptions you have an entire
world at your feet at your disposal
selling all kinds of
contraptions
on every street corner around the world
but if you want the truth
then
when you look outside
you discover a barren wasteland
of empty desert and tumbleweeds you're
on your own
so let us discuss
freedom
you know a human being at some point in
his life is free
when he is a small child he is free
as he grows up he begins to gain an
identity through the portal
of a name
a whereabouts
who his family is
and then as he grows older he he gets
married he has children
and this applies to
obviously men and women
[Music]
and
something
happens to him along the way
and he doesn't really know the day that
it happened
but
from that moment forward
he enters into a different dimension
of life
which is an entirely false dimension
and in doing so he leaves freedom
completely behind
he enters into the dimension
of a new identity
one of being a
mother or a father
or a child
of a
or a sister or a brother
if we speak specifically about families
for now
he enters into
an entire escapade an entire circus an
entire drama an entire soap opera
and
and he doesn't view it as such because
to use the word soap opera
is to trivialize it
as if
one could see it as a soap opera
but
the human being doesn't see it as a soap
opera he sees it as his reality
and so within this
so-called family structure
many things begin to go wrong
there are conflicts and there are
um
this person wants this and this person
wants that
and the child wants this and the parent
wants that
and there's this complex web of
interconnection
and these interconnections
are not interconnections of humans
they are interconnections
of minds
and each of these minds
is beholden
and mired
and
caught in a web of attachment
and
each person is attached to his or her
own idea
as to what the other person should do
and
ultimately
that attachment is based upon a
foundation of
wanting to make oneself quote happy
and that happiness won't come
unless
things happen in a certain way and the
things that happen in a certain way are
dependent upon
the other person or person's
acquiescing to that way
and then there's conflict then there's
sorrow and then there's sadness and then
there's anger and then there's anxiety
and then there's fear
and then there's resentment and then
there's pains and then there's apologies
and then there's and and this is how the
human being life human being's life
moves
and he
over years begins to live in this way
for so long
that
this becomes real to him
this becomes
his new life
and his only life
and then he begins to naturally seek
fixes
as to how to
move away from and gain freedom from
this anxiety and this fear and these
such things
and then that creates a new subset
of
imprisonment
which is the imprisonment of the fixes
and each fix leads to a different fix
and
he goes to the psychologist and the
psychologist says well
make sure that you are kind and
forgiving and
say this but don't say that and
understand that people are sometimes
this way and they'll get over it and
eventually
you'll come around they'll come around
he just
extends the soap opera for you
and then he goes to motivational speaker
and he tells him raw raw
crap
and
uh
you know
try to
you know be happy
and
get over yourself and pick yourself up
and today's a new day and
that leads to more imprisonment
and then he reads books about self-help
and self-development
and they give him aphorisms to say and
so-called hacks
and morning routines and
meditate and
go for a run and exercise
and then he and then he goes to
a spiritual person or a guru or
or a monk
or a buddhist priest or
and they tell him
their own version of prescriptions and
austerities that
he should be doing and
and
no matter what the other person says
you know exude love and
give compassion
and
and so this person then
enters this washing machine
in which he rolls around
for years and years and years
in response
and in order to fix
the previous washing machine that he had
entered
which is the soap opera of the new
identity of family and attachments and
so forth
and thus he becomes imprisoned in every
way possible
so what is the truth
well
[Music]
the the truth is that there's no way to
prescribe oneself into into freedom
there's only
a way to prescribe oneself
into imprisonment
that's the truth
what is the truth about arriving at
freedom
the truth about arriving at freedom
is to understand what freedom really is
wild freedom raw freedom
is freedom from the need to have to fix
anything
it is freedom from
the very arising
of pain
it is freedom from
the impetus
that spawns
emotional turmoil
it is the freedom from the very seed
of the devastation
that human beings feel
it is a return back to one's natural
state
before he succumbed
to the images
that led to the soap operas
in which he finds himself living
that sort of freedom
does not exist in
society and it does not exist within the
halls
of monasteries
it exists only as a possibility
in the one who truly desires it
not for the pleasure that it will bring
but
because it will bring an end to the
search for all pleasure
raw freedom
wild freedom
is a state in which one understands
that he is entered into soap operas
and that in these soap operas of
identity and image
nothing will ever be all right
he will spend his entire life clenching
his teeth
biting his tongue
clenching his fists
trying to convince himself that it is
okay
when in his heart
he knows that it is not
nothing can ever be okay nothing will
ever be
peaceful in the world of attachment
and naturally
and very logically the question arises
how can one not be attached to their
family
how can a parent not be attached to
their children
and i think that
the word attachment must be understood
um
attachment is need
put simply attachment is need
i put up a message on twitter recently
which
i'll have to read it because i forgot
exactly what it is that i said
and it speaks perfectly to attachment
those whom you love
will be the source
of your suffering
and another one which says what a man
becomes attached to
becomes his coffin
now naturally one will ask how can one
not be attached to their family or their
spouse
or their children
well
if you ask the buddhist they'll tell you
don't be attached
which is
ludicrous i mean it's
it is so dismissive to say that
one must understand
not follow a precept
whenever one is attached
then the thing or the person to which
one is attached to
will be
the puppeteer
and you will be the puppet
that is attachment
however the other person or thing moves
will be
the way that
the person himself moves
this is attachment
so where there's attachment there cannot
be freedom
because
one's needs are invested
in the other person or the other thing
then naturally one will ask well how can
one not
be invested in their
family or children
you know
to have a child
is to give oneself
to the child
and need nothing in return from the
child
and that will come across too easily
that was spoken a little bit too easily
because it will be viewed as a platitude
but it won't be viewed as a platitude if
one understands the consequences of not
doing it that way
if one views exactly and genuinely with
open eyes where one is
he sees that
he's trapped
and he's trapped in such profound misery
and anxiety and fear
that he doesn't know which way is up
anymore
so the truth is that which
is
acutely necessary
not
that which sounds nice
it is that which is desperately
necessary
when one is no longer attached
to needing respect or to needing
so-called love
or to needing reciprocation
or to needing the other person to make
him happy
when one is no longer attached
to the idea of happiness itself
he becomes wildly free
and this is exactly what every human
being
from the depths of their bones
is craving
whether they realize it or not
good night
the title of this podcast is
why leaders are
ruled by their subordinates
you know this is a fairly common issue
although it's
rarely
uh recognized
it certainly is recognized within
uh the hearts of leaders who feel this
sort of imprisonment
it happens a lot for instance in
medicine as an example
many physicians are
in effect ruled by their nurses
in businesses
executives are often ruled by their
secretaries
ceos
often feel
a sense of insecurity
around certain employees
and
within the mind of the leader there is a
fairly
uh pronounced conundrum and that is that
outwardly and
from a
a hierarchical business perspective
the leader is the leader and the leader
is in charge of his or her subordinates
but this is in direct contrast to the
feeling that he or she sometimes has
that
there is a particular level of
insecurity or fear
with regard to one's secretary or with
regard to
a particular employee
and that leader often feels
sandwiched in between
these two ideas one being that he or she
should not feel uh fear
because
the person is in fact the leader
and the subordinate is the subordinate
and on the other hand there is an
undeniable feeling
that one is in fact afraid or feels
enslaved by
the subordinate
so where you have these two
a confluence of these two
contrary elements
the individual
feels
trapped in between them
it is very difficult almost impossible
to admit to another person
uh from an egoic perspective
that he or she is afraid of their
subordinate and it is
in many ways even more difficult to
admit to oneself
that
one is afraid of their subordinates
because once something is
stated
either as a deliberate conscious thought
or
verbally to oneself
then
it enters the domain of reality it
becomes documented in the fabric of
reality and once that step is taken it
cannot be reversed
as long as it is a passing thought one
can suppress it
and one can deny it
but as soon as it is stated
with full conscious effort to one's own
self then there's no going there's no
turning back
and that's why it is very difficult for
human beings in general to be completely
honest with themselves
this is confounded by
and in very many ways created by
rules so
why is it that
fear of someone should cause problems
well the rules say that you are the
leader and therefore you should lead
but the rules also say
that
you should be compassionate and you
should be understanding and you should
be caring and the leader should be
empathetic
and nurturing to those he means
to lead or to guide
or to govern
and whenever you have
that many rules you one cannot possibly
satisfy them all
because
amidst those rules there are definitely
feelings that are undeniable and those
feelings do not acquiesce to rules
those feelings stand
on their own in their own right
they don't succumb to rules only the
intellect
likes to
adhere to rules
so what is a person to do who who feels
a sense of fear
of their subordinates
well it isn't a question of what one
should do really it's it's a matter of
understanding because if you
view things from the standpoint of what
to do then even if you're given a
an effective answer as to what to do
that'll only apply to a particular
circumstance and therefore you will need
ten thousand different answers for each
different circumstance and that is
hardly a practical way to approach any
problem
whereas if
one approaches things from the level of
understanding then that understanding
becomes pluripotent
and it applies to to all things it's
very nimble and liquid and fluid
um and customizable to various different
situations situations
so
the understanding is that first and
foremost is it is crucial to be honest
with oneself now is that a rule no it's
not a rule um there is a complete
necessity
because
rules are based upon morality and
and societal tenets and shoulds and
should nots and
righteous uh
sort of ideas
whereas understandings and things that
are necessary
are based upon
the way things are and if they are not
done that way
then problems occur
not created by society but by nature so
if one is honest with oneself
then most problems begin to actually
go away
in fact it is precisely because one is
not honest with oneself that they are in
fact afraid or intimidated by a certain
subordinate
that
perpetuates the problem
uh
if one is completely honest with oneself
that this person makes me
uneasy
uh even though this person is is quote
below me on a from a hierarchical
standpoint
the fact is i'm a human being that
person's a human being and we're human
beings before
we are ceo versus employee
and as a human being um
ceo though i may be
leader though i may be
this person
causes some fear within with inside of
me
the very
an admission of that fact to oneself
changes the game
because now that person
is not playing a reactive game
now that person isn't looking for a
solution
that person is defining the problem
so
once one is honest with oneself that
this employee makes me nervous
then then
the
the most important thing is to
understand what is it that one truly
fears
well this is where things become
interesting
no one really fears another
human beings fear themselves
what does that mean i'll explain
human beings fear what their reaction
will be
to the reaction of the other person
this is what they fear
human beings also fear
the feeling that they will have
once the other person
makes the
reaction
that he or she is predicted to make
so human beings are afraid
of
feeling a certain way if for instance
the leader says to do x
and the employee says no i'm not going
to do it
that
that sort of quote disobedience
or denial of the leader will create
within a leader a problem
one is embarrassment
another
is
the feeling that
he or she
did not adhere to his authority
um
that will then lead to questions of what
he or she should do
which will then lead to questions of
well if if he reacts in a certain way
then will the reaction
be looked upon as simply retaliation or
or something that was done that was
necessary
so a whole litany of things will come
into the leader's mind and so the leader
does not want to feel cornered
the leader does not want to feel
um
that
his word was not listened to because
that will create further insecurity
within him so what we are afraid of what
all humans are afraid of
are
the negative feelings
that will arise
from situations um
the
the the person who plays a sport
uh the athlete who plays a sport
the reason that he fears losing
is because he he he doesn't fear losing
itself
he fears the fear
that
well
he fears the feeling
that the losing creates
not the loss itself
so there are so many things that happen
within the mind of a leader
um
that to which he is reacting to on a
constant basis that he does not even
recognize or realize that he is reacting
to
because the things that he's reacting to
are never even seen and the reason they
are never seen is because he lives in a
society in a culture that promotes
action as opposed to
incisiveness
it it
it promotes
prescription
as opposed to
introspection
it is precisely in the seeing of things
that one becomes free
it is precisely in the doing of things
that one remains bound
so if a leader wishes to create pure
actions
and by and
as a result of those pure actions to
live in a place of peace within himself
so that his actions can continue to be
pure and effective
then he will have to
arrive at a point
in which he recognizes that every one of
his actions are motivated by a
particular stimulus and that stimulus is
within him
and in the recognition and the seeing of
what those stimuli
are only then will he be able to become
truly effective
without
causing turmoil to
the maturation of his company
or
to
his day-to-day existence
so it is precisely in the seeing of
things in the honest
genuine
natural organic
introspection
to discover what is at the heart
what is at the core that is driving all
of one's actions
it is in seeing those things that makes
a leader truly supreme
good night
the title of this solo podcast
is what is life
it's very difficult to know what
precisely life is
is it
the events that occur in a
human being's life is that life
is it how he feels
is it
his accomplishments his failures
how his children turn out what his
family life is is like
from what angle can one view something
and this is the difficult thing about
everything is that there's so many
angles
there's there's no clear guide to
anything one can view anything at all
from any perspective
the mind is infinite it travels to all
domains in a flash
in an instant
we are told by society that
we should do this and that and we should
view life from this perspective
and that life is about
happiness life is about helping other
people
but even if you look at the standpoint
of
or the viewpoint of helping other people
what is that
but
a chance to make oneself feel good
so there's nothing negative or positive
about any of these things it's
the question is what is the truth
is is life all about
wanting to feel good
because that seems to be the driving
force behind
the fundamental
existence of man
is the desire to feel good
i wish to succeed so that i may feel
good i wish to
become wealthy so that i may feel good i
wish to help others so that i may
feel that i'm a benevolent individual
and that i have done for my fellow man i
wish to be kind to others so that i can
gain a
a sense of moral correctness
so everything is related
to
an ulterior motive of wanting to feel
good
and
really
you know i i grow tired of of sometimes
mentioning these disclaimers
um but it there's no negative or
positive here there's no right and wrong
there's no good and bad
it isn't wrong or negative
to want to feel good
it's an examination of the truth well
what is it that
life fundamentally
in its ultimate grainy reality
what is it
i think it's a falling leaf
i think it's a river that flows
toward the ocean without having any
interest in arriving at the ocean
nor
any interest in
being proud of its effort
of moving towards the ocean
i think it's the wind that blows
a knock on the door
a clapping of one's hands
anything and everything
that has
nothing at all to do with the intellect
that is life
anything at all that does not involve
the domain of thought and thinking
or strategizing or intentionality
or
wanting to
achieve
or
hoping
to provide
or
desiring to gain
or needing to give
where there are not even
the seeds of rules
where there isn't even the shadow of
hope
where what is
is
and there is no opinion
about what is
what is life
it's the ringing of a bell
that's one's entire life
there is no significance to anything
and the reason that there is no
significance to anything is because
nothing lasts
there cannot be anything significant
about something that does not last
an emotion arrives today and it leaves
the very next minute
a success arrives today
and
it fails to have an impact
after a few weeks or a few days
there is a
constant need for replenishment
a constant need to replace what has
disappeared
therefore there is nothing permanent
everything in this life is temporary
therefore how can it have any
significance
nothing can have a weight
a w-e-i-g-h-t
nothing can have a weight
if it is here only for a moment
i think one of the central
myths
that leads humans astray
is once again something that is
so invisible like prescriptions that it
has never
even thought to be examined and that is
the need to become happy
and whenever i say anything it is
it will be natural the natural reflexive
tendency of your mind
to immediately jump to
the opposite
so if i say
that
a myth that leads men astray is the need
to be happy
the mind will often immediately jump to
well then should i be sad
and happiness and sadness
joy and misery
are
are all the same
because
because they only exist because of the
other
there would be no
need for happiness if there was no
misery
so they are interdependent
and because they are interdependent they
cannot survive in their own soil
when one thing requires another then it
doesn't in fact exist
it is only a reaction to
it is spawned by
something that is real something that is
true
exists
of its own domain
it needs no support
it requires no explanation
it is truth
it is solid
it is incontrovertible
it depends upon no one
and nothing
so
what is life
like all things i i think that wonder
rides at the truth by way of negation
by way of elimination by way of
subtraction
and when all the things
that one has believed to be significant
when all the things that one has
believed
to be real
and all the beliefs that one has had
are removed
when they are seen through
when they are recognized
as
a whim of the mind
and an imbibement
of
societal influence
then the amorphous and unspeakable
nameless
non-entity that remains
is the closest thing to the truth
while there is everything in this life
it is all a mirage
it's it's
passing clouds
it's
one explosion after another
it's sound that comes and goes
and we as humans get in the way
and as we get in the way
we feel as if it is happening to us
but in reality things happen in the
vicinity of ourselves they do not really
happen to us because there really is no
us for them to
happen to
i think it's very important
not to attempt to read into my words uh
because if you do then you
will
fall into the trap
of intellectualization um
the words must have a communion with
one's interiority
without being touched by the filtering
mechanism of the mind
for the filtering mechanism of the mind
will repackage them into untruth
it will repackage them into ideas
to
analyze
and philosophize about
and this will lead to
questions that are
based largely in
intellectual gymnastics
and this is precisely the habit of the
mind because it recognizes that when a
human hears truth its job is to remove
him as quickly as possible from that
truth in order to keep it within its
domain of the mind
what whatever gets through gets through
and what does not does not
there is no need from my end
for things to get through
as their
it would be best if there was no need
for you
to need to allow things to get through
whatever the communion is it is whatever
the chemical reaction that takes place
between two elements
takes place
involvement
is interference
so what is life
it's nothing in everything
in all the things that one has thought
that his life really was
it really is not
good night
the title of this solo podcast is
the secret of otherworldly success
you know it seems to be the fashion uh
in writing
that you
hold the secret or the
the climax
until the end
and you
build up to it
i don't really believe in such things
i like to reveal it at the beginning
because quite frankly
whenever there's a build up to things
usually it almost never pans out
so
uh
i don't believe in playing games
the secret to otherworldly success
is purity
what does that mean
when
someone fantasizes
or dreams of becoming a success
the
crux
and the
essence of that dream centers around
the periphery of the success what
someone will get how
wealthy they will become
how it will feel
to have finally quote made it
all these are all the fringes and the
benefits
and the pleasures of success so the
dreams of success are never really about
the thing they're
almost always about
the
the pleasurable aspects
of what the success will
gain someone
that is impure
now in that very breath i must
state that there is no right or wrong
and there is no rule that one must be
pure
there
everything happens everything that is of
any
importance happens
due to the effect not due to rules
so the effect of doing things impurely
is that one never has
his full faculties at his command
he is always subservient to
the pleasure of the outcome
he is always enslaved to
the execution of whatever needs to be
executed
while not having all of his tools
available to him
because what he is chasing is
the pleasurable outcome or the award or
the money or the trophy or whatever it
may be
the cause
of chasing pleasure
the cause
of chasing the fringe benefits of
success
naturally and necessarily leads to the
effect
of
being
handcuffed
as one pursues that success
therefore
the real world consequence
of impurity
is
ineffectiveness
when something is done
from a pure standpoint
then one is chasing the thing itself
now
even this
must be
looked at with open eyes
an individual might for instance have
grown up in poverty
and
that person's
success that person's goal might be
to
become wealthy
wealthy for wealthy sake just to escape
poverty
since there are no rules there is no
good and bad there is no morality
if
that person
is pure in his desire for wealth
because it frees him from a life of
poverty
if that is pure in his heart
then
that is not a fringe benefit
so it might this is where society will
really fall apart
this is a bridge that it cannot cross
because it is
it is uh so
handcuffed
and straight jacketed by rules
that it cannot see beyond the blinders
of its own
false moral senses
when one does thing for the something
for the purity of it
because the thing itself
is what
drives him
and it is not done for the fringe
benefit or for the
the door prize so to speak
then one
gains all of the faculties that one
needs all of his talents become
available to him
and
i'll explain why that is
the
behind every success there's often a
great insecurity
the insecurity of wondering if one will
make it
and that insecurity that fear of not
being able to make it
actually leads to a flailing of the arms
and a running in all directions
and a a hard working and a
beating oneself to the bone and
bloodying one's hands and all the
romantic ideas that are the natural
offshoots
of
something that is driven by fear
something that is driven by anxiety
so
when that is not there
when the feeling
of anxiety or fear of not making it is
not there then the quality of one's
efforts and the quality of one's pursuit
changes drastically
when when it is no longer part of the
equation
that one may not make it
one's entire life
the entire complexion of one's journey
changes
i will say that in in almost all cases
the pursuit of success
is always
[Music]
spurred
by
a fear of failure
so if through whatever means one
recognized that
making it was a certainty
then the things that he would and would
not do
would be drastically different
than the things he would and would not
do
if he were spurred by the anxiety
and the fan the fear of possibly not
making it
so where there is purity where there is
a
a sense of
doing something
for
a
very
focused
in a very
focused
way
for a very focused outcome
to arrive at the truth about whatever
one's domain is whatever one's craft
whatever one's art
may be
one begins to feel in his heart that
that thing is accessible
because of the purity with which he is
pursuing it
and
it must be repeated it must be
underscored
that this purity is not a rule it is not
good to be pure
it is not proper or correct
it is simply effective
it is simply the way
to do things that results in the least
interference
it is the way to approach things that
allows one to have all of his faculties
and his talents
in his back pocket
perhaps the greatest misunderstanding in
the world of performance among sports
psychologists and business coaches
and motivational speakers in the whole
lot
is this idea that performance is a goal
and it is fundamentally not true
performance is a side effect
if it is viewed as a goal
it fails
the world is enamored by the idea of
skill acquisition
across all professional sports and all
domains of business and entertainment
and
in olympics and
whatever it may be
the idea
that is in the water the central tenet
upon which all
pursuits are based with regards to
coaching
in the world of performance is that
skill acquisition is the god
that acquiring skill
is the most important thing
but in all of my experiences in all of
my experimentations and in my
examinations and in my dissections of
this topic over many years
i have discovered that skill acquisition
is not
by any means the biggest problem of
elite individuals
their problem is skill access
if one has a million dollars in the bank
but he can only access four hundred
thousand
the solution is not
to deposit more money in the bank
and yet this is exactly what all
sports psychologists and performance
coaches around the world do
the real solution is to find out why it
is that one has a million dollars in the
bank but he can only access four hundred
thousand
so skill access this is a problem access
it is not a problem of acquisition
because this individual has already
acquired
the amount that's in the bank
but he is six hundred thousand dollars
short in his ability to access it
so the world seems to have everything on
its head
it
seems to look at everything backwards
and it is no reason that
well it's no wonder that everyone goes
astray
because they are subject to false ideas
ideas that are based upon opinion and
tradition
and not based upon truth
so
if one views things from the sense of
purity
if one views things from the sense of
discovering
what it is that really moves that person
and arrives at the point in which the
idea
and the poison of
not of possibly not making it
is removed
then that person
gains access to all of his skill
and he saves
many many years
in his pursuit
of the otherworldly success
and the more pure he becomes
the less he cares about failures along
the way and the more he views them as
experimentations naturally not by some
motivational quote
naturally this is a natural offspring
this is a natural byproduct of
all other worldly things are side
effects
if they are pursued as goals they fail
if one views things from the standpoint
of purity
and if that purity is refined and
refined
until nothing but the vision remains
otherworldly success
will chase a man
to the ends of the earth
good night
the title of this
solo podcast
is the raw truth
about living in the moment
let's get straight to the point
there is nothing that you can do
to
get into the moment with any form of
consistency
there is no prescription
there is no breathing method
there is no meditation
there is no mindfulness
there is nothing in the world that
exists ever anywhere
on in any part of the planet
that a human being
can employ
as some form of a doing or a
prescription or a trick or a technique
or a hack or a method no matter how holy
or how spiritual
or how lauded it may be
it is not possible
this is yet another example of
society leading people astray and also
quite frankly another example of people
seeking
to be led astray
the moment is an otherworldly element
only because
a human being
has been
led elsewhere
by his belief systems and his
conditioning and where he has been led
is
into the realms of the mind
the mind which tells him
who he is
the mind which tells him what is right
and what is wrong
the mind that tells him what he must do
and often times what he must do in order
to get out of the mind
you see the mind
doesn't care what you're doing even if
you're waging war with it
as long as you are doing something
because as long as it keeps you
prescribing and as long as it keeps you
doing some form of an activity
it knows that it has you
so
if you came to this solo podcast
seeking to get into the moment
what i will tell you is
something that is pure honest sincere
and truthful
if you leave this podcast with one truth
not as an intellectual form of learning
but as a
realization that hits home and perhaps
it won't hit home today and perhaps it
may even
over the years
um
perhaps you'll come to it by
repeated failures
of having arrived at the moment through
the various different means that
gurus and books in the spiritual
community has tried to convince you of
that is this
it is impossible
to prescribe your way into the moment
with any form of regularity
or consistency
living in the moment
is a complete impossibility
by way of a bridge of prescription
don't believe me
i will speak the truth
you can do with with it what you like
whenever there is an intermediary of
prescription
the light is
shined upon that intermediary
it never leads you
this is a bridge that goes nowhere
then how about
when a person does find the moment
well
the person who finds the moment by
accident which is typically how it
happens
he experiences the glory of the moment
and in that time there are no thoughts
and there are no feelings and there are
no emotions it's this feeling of great
peace
probably the greatest word to say is
it's overwhelming peace
everything is settled
there's a sense of floating almost that
no matter what happened it would be okay
but those things come
very rarely and they come and even when
they come they come and they go very
quickly
so so
is it truly possible to arrive at the
moment and live there
well
i have raised the question and now i
suppose i must answer it
the answer is going to be
anticlimactic
because the answer is going to be yes
but you will not hear that yes
you will not hear it
without hoping for
a prescription that might follow the
word yes
in finding the moment
in living in the moment
this arrives in what i call living in
the cocoon of the moment
it arrives when someone
truly desires it
genuinely and naturally
as opposed to viewing it as a success
as opposed to viewing it as a form of
accomplishment
if it is a feather in the cap
it does not come
so
the idea that i want to get into the
moment often is a very reactive idea
um it is a
it's it's reactive to a feeling which
says that one should get into the moment
it's reactive to the idea
that
it's healthy proper
correct spiritual
to get into the moment
those don't those sort of sorts of ideas
they don't have any power to sustain
anyone
they're full of fumes
the person who seeks the moment
genuinely
is the person who realizes
that everything in his life
leads nowhere
that behind every door
is an empty room
and no matter what the promise may be
it's always an empty room
inside every sealed box
are more sealed
boxes and as each one of those sealed
boxes is opened
they're always empty
as
and no and please
don't believe that either it would be
foolish to believe me
the only things that you should believe
are the things that don't require belief
and that is your own direct experiences
one might wonder why is it that one
has not come to see that
if they've opened a thousand empty boxes
and they have all come to come up empty
and they have
opened a thousand doors which promised
many things and yet when they opened
every one of them eventually they turned
out to be
empty rooms
then why would not why would one not
come to the realization that all things
in this life lead nowhere
and all things in this life are
anticlimactic well the reason is is
because
of hope
there is
there is a
belief
that is created by the mind which says
yes
1 000 doors that you have opened have
all led to empty rooms i realized that
but what if 1007
is the
jackpot and it is that very belief which
keep what keeps one hooked
then
even if that person opens seven thousand
dollars
which leaves leads to empty rooms
then
there will always be that belief in that
thought
that 7006
might be the jackpot and if you stop now
if you abandon this hope at seven
thousand
then you might just forfeit that jackpot
at 7006 if you just would have stuck
around a little bit longer
and this is how the mind leads human
beings astray for their entire lives
but when one comes to see
that all of the things that he had hoped
for in this life be it in his
relationships with his family his
children his successes his failures all
of the things that he looked forward to
in his life all of the things that he
thought would pan out and that wealth
would make him quote happy and that even
happiness would make him happy
when
one
comes to the realization
that he's finished
that he's done
that there really is no such thing
as a full room behind a door
then one naturally begins to retreat
from
the worldly domain
and though he may still continue to live
in the world
he lives above it
because he has come to see
that everything in the end is empty
that hope leads nowhere
and for the person who views this as
negative and pessimistic
i have no words
of consolation for you
all i can say is this isn't for you
there is no amount of convincing
that will undo that belief from you
this is
direct truth
which absolutely
implores
that you do not believe it
so the cocoon of the moment
is a place that one arrives at
where the possibility of it arises
when one has no interest
in any intermediary or prescription to
get there because he realizes that any
trick that gets him there
will trick him right out of it
i do not for one second believe that
anyone should be in the moment
i don't think it's good i don't think
it's bad i don't think it's spiritual i
don't think it's holy
i don't think it's healthy
if you have a choice it isn't for you
but when one is in the moment it isn't a
source of pleasure
the cocoon of the moment is a place
in which one naturally forgets himself
and no it is not noble to forget oneself
all of these things are practical
realizations
they are
nothing related in any shape or form to
shoulds or properness or correctness or
spirituality or holiness
it is about a human being
returning
to becoming a human being
the one who seeks materialism in this
world is no different than the one who
seeks spiritual
materialism if one seeks a ferrari
and another person seeks a way to get
into the moment they are both
materialistic people
and
once again in the same breath is it
wrong
to be materialistic there is no wrong
it is just that
it leads to pain
it leads to frustration
if one enjoys pain and frustration then
one is free to do so and
i'm not being facetious
i'm being genuine
it is foolish to try to
bring a human being out of his own
miseries
because the implicit belief is that the
person wants to be relieved of his
miseries
there is great pleasure in misery
because where there is misery there is
comfort there is a sense of identity
it's home
so the moment
has nothing to do with
any sort of doing in order to get there
buddhist monks are not in the moment
zen disciples are not in the moment
they're too busy
following their own cultural beliefs and
rituals to get into the moment
the person who does a prescription or is
looking for a way to get into the moment
doesn't
see the contradiction in that
the contradiction that is inherent in
that is
that
a person cannot get into the moment
because the moment only exists when the
person disappears
there cannot be two
so how can you bring yourself into the
moment
when the very act of you bringing a you
with you
prevents the moment
if there was no you
there would be only the moment
there is nothing else
now what is the truth regardless of
whether
you are ready for it or not or are you
ready to believe it or not which you
should not be ready to believe it
the truth is at the moment is all there
really is
there is nothing else
because the moment actually never goes
away
it is the only thing that never dies
it is the only consistency
in reality is judged by that which never
disappears
that is truth
so the moment the cocoon of the moment
is for the person who was ready
not ready to get a taste
or so that he can feel a dose of
pleasure and come back and talk about
how wonderful it felt
there's no difference between that and
having a lollipop
these are for serious human beings
sincere human beings who've come to the
realization
that no matter what they achieve in this
life in the end it is nothing
and the one who achieves the moment the
one
who is qualified to live in the moment
is the one who was ready
to be nothing
good night
the title of this
solo podcast is
the prison
of need
you know i think the
most essential thing
to understand um
and if you get nothing else out of this
solo podcast
this would
perhaps be the most resounding message
that if you walked away with
uh it
perhaps might benefit you and that would
be
that whatever i'm about to say
the idea of trying to live up to it or
the idea of trying to achieve it or the
idea of thinking that this must be done
because it's good for you and because
it's healthy
and because it's correct and it's proper
and it's spiritual
uh that's that's a that's a very
significant
mistake because the things that i talk
about you know these are not
things like
you know shining your shoes or
you know combing your hair in a
particular way or
you know five different ways to make
your skin cleaner
i mean these are
these are deep
deep seated
emotional
and fundamental issues within human
beings
they are
they are
well well beyond
the realm and the grasp of
prescription
there is no there isn't there isn't any
way in the world
that any human being alive
could prescribe his way to to
such things such as
ridding himself or herself of need
any attempt to rid oneself of need or
attachment
is
is an utter failure from the very
beginning
because it is
uh
it's an attempt to adhere to an idea
and human beings only do things
sincerely when they have no other choice
and they arrive at having no other
choice
when the pain
and the disappointment and the misery
of continuing on in the same way
is simply no longer sustainable human
beings have an enormous capacity for
pain an enormous
threshold for misery
but
when
for a given person
that threshold is reached and it can no
longer
be tolerated it is only then that
someone becomes a true candidate
to walk this path
anything short of that is one trying to
live up to some notion
that is good for him and that will fail
that'll fail before you walk out the
door um
because it's just
something like need is so deep within
human beings
a person needs his spouse to love him he
needs
his children to revere and respect him
he needs
to be loved by his children he needs to
be
told that he's doing a good job he needs
the adoration of his friends
he needs the companionship of
various
different people
he needs
the validation of
the world
the
the needs spread so far and so wide
you know they span the earth 16 times
how in the world
would you begin to prescribe
your way out of that i mean that's just
it's beyond unserious
um
you know
the the web of need is so intricate the
the
complexity
and the
tentacles of attachment
uh
run so deep within the human being
um
that
it it makes him a complete prisoner and
even as i say that
don't agree with me
because
what will happen is that your mind will
say you know what he's saying is right
it does make me a prisoner it makes me
sad it makes me sorrowful
it leads to disappointment and pain and
anxiety and stress so
that's right it does and i really need
to get away from this attachment
you'll fail
that isn't that isn't powerful enough
intellectual understanding isn't
powerful enough say a situational
attempt to flee
uh isn't powerful enough it's only when
you hit a brick wall
and the realization that behind that
brick wall are an endless row of brick
walls
then there's a chance so forget about
the idea of trying to get away from need
or to
overcome and dismantle all your
attachments forget about achieving those
things uh it's it
if
something benefits you or doesn't
benefit you whatever chances of that
there are
it will only arise by
by listening with a
genuine ear
and not listening in order to follow
because i'm not telling you to do
anything so there's nothing to follow
but
understand
not with
understand not so that you may do
uh but so that you may understand
you know the
how many needs does a person have
in every compartment of his life from
his professional life
to his personal life
there are an endless array of needs
he needs to become a success he needs to
make more money he needs
when he goes to the grocery store he
needs the clerk to respond kindly to him
there are
these things are so deep
and there are so many and don't for a
second think that you're right i should
not need the clerk to be happy with me
you know let's just forget about all of
those things never never believe that
the opposite of what i'm saying is the
truth the opposite of what i'm saying
will lead you to the same hell as what
i'm saying itself um
you know imagine imagine for a second
uh not with any attempt or hope of
arriving there
just imagine for a second
that
you had no need
you did not need your family to love you
you did not need your children
to look up to you or respect you or
listen to you
you did not need to become a success you
did not need
to become validated you did not need for
your friend to return your text message
or your phone call
you did not need your your boss to
compliment you
you did not need to look
handsome or pretty
you did not need to be considered
cultured or fashionable
imagine that if you had absolutely no
needs
[Music]
where you would be what that would what
kind of life that would be
and i and i must say right from the
start that
their you know this world is filled with
people who give reflexive responses who
who do not have the bandwidth to listen
to anything
without letting their mouth run wild
with statements
like well if i had no need then why
would i be here if i had no need
and blah blah you know
for those people they need to just shut
up and leave
this is not for them this will never be
for them so don't waste my time
or yours and just leave i'm not
interested in your comments so this is
for the people who truly want who are
truly interested in
silently quietly
allowing these words to seep into them
to see if they find a home or if there's
natural
aversion to them
without any response whatsoever any
response is a false response and the
quicker the response comes the more of a
fool the person is was responding
so imagine for a second that if a person
had no need
how freely that person would move in
this world
imagine that
you're
you did not need your child to look up
to you imagine
that is ultimate freedom
um
now what would be the mistakes what
would be the holes what would be the
natural questions that arise what will
be the holes in the understanding of
this what would it mean to misunderstand
well what it would mean to misunderstand
would be
that if one viewed this as someone who
was
completely
unfeeling and
did not
register anything that was going on
around him and that simply wouldn't be
the case in fact if a person has no need
then that person is available to every
single person in his life
a person who has no need
is not a burden
and
human beings are constant burdens to
each other
and the greatest
burden is the weight of need
but
if you know someone or knew someone or
imagined that you knew someone
who needed nothing from you
now that's easy to say for someone who
is a stranger but imagine if it was a
family member or a friend or someone
close to you who needed nothing from you
who didn't need a thank you or an
apology or not even a
a
a pleasant gesture
that person
be a person that you would naturally
gravitate towards now
you gravitating towards that person
wouldn't be that person's intent he
wouldn't care less
but
being free of need isn't about making
others
peaceful in your presence
that's just a natural side effect
being free of need first and foremost
is
to escape the imprisonment that need
produces
and don't try to escape the imprisonment
because you'll fail
but it is it is just
the ultimate utopia
to live a life without need now
why is it or
in what way
would such a thing
even be possible
well it would even it would become
possible
when someone recognizes
that this world can give no one anything
this world can give someone temporary
pleasures
it does have that ability
but those temporary pleasures are
temporary
and therefore
they need to be replenished
so this world cannot give anything to
anyone of any lasting value
no human being can give anything to any
other human being of any lasting value
that
and it's very important that you don't
listen to what i just said
um because if you do it'll be
intellectual
it's you you have to
marry that with your own experiences
experiences of your own life
that must be seen in retrospect
with objectivity and deep
analysis and nuance
and sensitivity
don't ever buy or believe what i say
when someone realizes that
need leads to a brick wall
it leads to attachment and it leads an
attachment leads to pain
and conflict and anxiety and fear
and that most importantly of all
that it simply cannot lead
anywhere else but those places
you see if there's if there's a chance
that need could lead to freedom
then it would be logical
for human beings
to
entertain need since there was a
possibility that it could lead to
freedom even though
the odds were very heavily stacked
against that
but if there is zero chance that need
can lead to freedom
then that might make a person
consider
and examine
so once again i'm not trying to talk you
into it in fact i'm trying to talk you
out of it if anything
i'm trying to talk you out of the idea
of trying to get over need and
attachment
but if you had no need in your life
you would move you would move completely
free in this world
nothing would affect you
everything would be greeted with a smile
and not a prescriptive smile not a fake
and false body language that is being
taught to you
as a
reactive
and defensive
cosmetic attempt to pretend as if you
are not being
affected
but naturally
when you need nothing
you have everything
good night
the title of this
solo podcast
is the perfect
leader
[Music]
what is the perfect leader
the perfect leader is the one
who is pure
[Music]
what does it mean to be pure
it means that a person
has no insecurities
it means that he lives in total freedom
it means that within himself there are
no self-conflicts
the problem
with leading human beings
[Music]
is that if one tries to lead them
[Music]
he meets with resistance
the the very intention to try to lead
is an egoic intention
[Music]
is there anything wrong with ego
there is nothing wrong with anything
the only thing that matters is if
something is effective or ineffective
wrong and right are for
the foolish
moors
and
fake ideals
created by society
a leader
has no intention to lead
when he isn't really interested in
helping
when
his personal satisfaction
does not come
from
the
[Music]
validation
[Music]
from his subordinates
[Music]
then he is fit to become perfect
when a leader has
conflicts within him
when he has fears
when he has anxieties
when he has insecurities
those fears anxieties and insecurities
manifest
they are
a lining
which accompanies every word that he
speaks
and every action that he takes
as such
his words and his actions are impure
and the only reason that
purity
is
something that i talk about
is because of its effectiveness
not because
it is a philosophical concept
the leader who is complete within
himself
will lead without trying to lead
there are so many things that there are
so many problems that a leader faces
when
he is at the head of an institution or
an organization or a company
[Music]
and the things that he faces will drive
him completely mad
from employee conflicts to
all sorts of problems
he will spend his entire life putting
out fires
this will become his identity
this will become his sole focus
even though this is not what he signed
up for
and the reason this is the case is
because this is the nature of human
beings
it is in the nature of human beings to
have conflict that is in the nature of
human beings
to not want to see the truth about
things
and if a leader enters that fray
he will become swallowed whole
and at the end of his career he will
look back
and find that he has wasted his entire
life
[Music]
trying to force human beings to do
something
trying to convince them to act a certain
way
does not lead to results
[Music]
human beings do things when they
see that there is something in it for
them
they do not do for another
though they may say they do
even the things that any human being
feels as if he is doing for another he
is actually doing for himself
and that is neither good nor bad
it is simply the nature of human beings
so the ultimate leader
is the one
who dives into
the depth of his own mind
in order to discover the holes that he
has
because he recognizes that all of the
vulnerabilities that exist within him
will be manifest
and the weak links in the chain that
exist within his own mind
will precisely be the weak links in the
chain
that exist in his company
or his organization
a solidness of the interiority of a
human being
is the greatest predictor
of the solidness of the quality of his
life
the nature of his leadership
and the nature of his company
if one seeks the truth
and yet he is still sympathetic
to the words of society
these are mutually exclusive concepts
society is not interested in the truth
any attempt
to
purposefully say this in order to make
one's subordinates feel a certain way
or to do this in order to appease them
or to
say this in order to make them feel
comfortable
all of those things fail because they
come from a place
of cosmetic action
and that which comes from a place of
cosmetic action is felt in the person
who is receiving it
it is felt as being cosmetic it is seen
through even though the employee
or the subordinate or the soldier
or whomever it may be
may enjoy
a temporary sense of pleasure that he
receives he will not respect it
human beings don't respect things that
are done for them necessarily
these respect things
that are done
for
from a place of purity
whether they realize it or not
but a leader has no interest in respect
he has no interest in reputation
if one is serious he will want to
discover
the nature of human beings
to attempt to garner one's respect
is foolish
people tend to respect those who need no
respect
who don't put on heirs
people tend to follow those people who
have no interest in being followed
who could not care less
what anyone else thinks
there is
something within human beings
that is at odds with
the conscious mind of human beings
and it is that something
which determines
if one follows not what the conscious
mind of the human being thinks
it will take for him to follow
the perfect leader is the one who
achieves perfection in himself
the one who attains freedom from his own
mind
the one who seriously and systematically
delves into
the nature of his fears
who sees with perfect clarity
the chinks in his armor
because it is precisely in seeing these
things
that they go away
but any attempt to fix
perpetuates the problem
and this is what society
simply doesn't have the bandwidth to
understand
there is no point in being a better
leader
why would one res why would one
waste one's resources and becoming
better
when he can spend his life becoming
perfect
the ultimate leader is able to stand on
his own two feet
though the world may be crumbling around
him
and this cannot be achieved
by way of an action or a five-step plan
it is when one is truly inspired
by the arrival
at such a place
that these things are possible for him
it is only for the super serious
the genuine the
sincere and such human beings tend to be
very rare
if one is going to devote himself to
anything
why not devote himself
to perfection
good night
the title of this solo podcast
is the
limitless the limitless human
every human being
is born and actually lives with
a very precious
a very delicate
a very magical
and a very grand possibility
he does not realize this
he looks at things from the standpoint
of
potential
he does not see things from the
standpoint
of what he already has
this
possibility that exists within him
is something that is channeled from
the void
or from the ether
from some
poorly understood
and mysterious place
which houses all the secrets of mankind
and every human being has it
what
must be understood
by the rare human
it frankly must be understood by
everyone but i know that
the ears of everyone
are not so attuned
as to imbibe
these sorts of truths
so for the individual who is that rare
human
what he must realize
is that this thing within him
is a limitlessness
he has the ability to channel and to
access ideas
and magical possibilities and truths
that he can use to his own benefit and
for the benefit of the world
but it is so delicate
it is as delicate as the butterfly's
wings
it is broken by a stiff breeze
it is so delicate that it must be
it can only live inside of
a quarantined room
any exposure to the outside world
destroys it
contaminates it
minimizes it
any association with any other human
being
is an enormous limitation
you you did not hear what i just said
because i spoke it too easily
any association
with another human being
is an enormous limitation
one's limitlessness
is only
preserved
and able to be accessed
in complete solitude
now even solitude is a problem
because
when one remains in solitude
his mind has still imbibed the
conditioning of the outside world
for however long he has lived
and it is that
conditioning that speaks to him so the
mind is the world
the mind is a mirror of the world
internalized
when one is in solitude
that mind will speaks that will speak
the world language to him
it will use words like
be practical
and
is this thing really
possible and
what have others done
and what if you are wrong
and all of these things and all of these
and what must be answered i mean these
things are
this is really
things that are never discussed about
anywhere in society
anywhere
what must be understood is that
these questions
or these comments made by the world
slash the mind
of is it practical and
what if it's not possible and
so forth
everyone falls for the trap of trying to
answer them
and then they go and associate with
people it doesn't matter who it is
all people are useless
every human being
other than you is useless to you
he or she
not only can but absolutely will limit
you
there is no choice
because as i said
this possibility is so delicate
that a stiff breeze destroys it
and so and association with human beings
is
a hurricane and a tsunami
forget a stiff breeze
so what must be understood is that
everyone will try to answer those
questions including you
you will try to
reason with your mind and say well it is
possible and
uh and others
have done it and i can do it better and
so forth and every answer that you give
is a limited answer
because the question was limited
i'll say that again
every answer that you give to a limited
question
must be a limited answer if if the
question is
can you reach level eight
your response
will immediately begin
at somewhere between seven and nine
that's limitation
and it's an arbitrary limitation
when someone is asked the question can
you get to level eight
no human being begins at level 1000 in
his response nobody zero
that isn't how the mind is wired
it will always begin with whatever it's
given
that is what it'll consider its starting
point
in most cases its ending point
so true limitlessness can
the possibility of accessing
that delicate magical
limitless
possibility
it only exists in solitude
because there is no human being that you
will ever meet in your entire life
who will not limit you
he will give you answers
and the answers that he gives you will
be society's answers
every human being is infected every
human being is a virus every human being
is conditioned
it is for this reason that one must be
quarantined
now
that gets rid of a major problem but
then a new problem begins and that is
that the human being himself is
is conditioned
but at least now one can deal with one
person's conditioning without having the
added weight and added problems
of
added conditionings on a daily basis
so the possibility of becoming limitless
only exists in isolation in solitude
when one gets to the point with his mind
that the idea of practicality
no longer exists
then he jumps to a new level
an entirely new level
there are many many more levels than
that
and if the stiff breeze touches any of
them
they will all fall like like dominoes
so in one's own mind
one must create a universe
of
limitlessness more accurately
one must
one must create the permission
for the limitlessness that already
exists
and
that permission
is not found anywhere in this world
in fact all that is found in this world
are hindrances
and you will spend your life
trying to
surmount obstacles that are constantly
thrown on your path
and each obstacle that you attempt to
surmount
will be a wasted amount of time
all these things take time
and you'll spend 50 years
surmounting obstacles
none of which would have existed
had you remained in isolation and not
exposed this
limitless possibility to the stiff
breeze in the tsunami and the hurricane
that is society
so one must
arrive at no
arrive at the permission of no
of
no concept of practicality
of no concept of impossibility
because if one does not remain in
isolation he will view things from the
standpoint of what has already been done
and that will become his eighth level so
to speak
and even if he gets to level 10
that doesn't answer the question
that just answers the question of
competition
that he may become better
that does not even approach
what the limitless level was
so
it is for this reason that i believe
nobody
i
talk to nobody
i
imbibe nobody
i do not read books
i already know that everything out of
everyone's mouth no matter how
intelligent it may sound is conditioned
it is limited
and i don't view what people say
i don't play the game of of comparing
what they say versus what others say and
then categorize
one
one person's speech as more intelligent
than another because that's just
comparing limitations
this person is a little bit less limited
than this person
that's all a limited
pursuit the entire thing
so you have to go where no human being
has gone before and in order to go where
no human being has gone before
you cannot go there with human beings
there's a reason why
no human being has gone there before and
it isn't because he didn't have the
aptitude
it is because his limitless possibility
was destroyed
there can be no self-doubt
the mind cannot question you
there can be no practicality
there can be no comparison to what's
already been done
those are not the questions and it's all
about questions the question is
where can i arrive
if limitations simply did not exist
and you can look under every single rock
in this world and you'll never find that
question
all you will find in this world is
limitations
because everyone will speak to you
according to their own conditioned
responses
now one might wonder what do i mean by
one cannot use practicality well
practicality is always one of the main
excuses
that's given by the conditioned world
be practical be realistic
and as soon as you hear that you're
finished
because then you're fighting even if you
don't believe that then you're fighting
against that statement
and that very fighting against it
is a false obstacle that has been
created
against which you now have to spend
energy and time fighting
whereas if that never existed if you
didn't expose yourself
to
society or other other people
then that false obstacle would not have
arisen
so
insane
impractical
unimaginable
laughable
possibilities
these are not meant
for any any serious individual to share
with the world
for to share it with the world is to
destroy them in the womb
this is why the serious person spends
his time alone
overcoming and conquering
all of the conditionings that have led
to the clipping
of the delicate wings of possibility
a human being has no limits
but as soon as he associates
with people
and society
he has nothing but limits
so the the
limitless human
is the one who fears
destroying the possibility
that nature
bestowed upon him
and he cannot risk
giving that away
good night
the title of this solo podcast is
the final frontier of the super human
so you you've accomplished all that
you've wanted to accomplish
you've made
millions or billions of dollars
or you've
achieved the pinnacle
in your craft
you've become world famous
you've accumulated
more wealth than you know what to do
with
so in every
regard
you are deemed amongst
the
super successful
the super humans
of society
so the question that i have now
for you is now what
you know there's a lot of years left to
live we don't know
how many years there are but there
certainly could
chances are there are many years left
how are you going to fill that time
i think this is a question that
perhaps not consciously but at least
subconsciously plagues many individuals
who
have achieved
great things in their life
and
now
are stricken by boredom
and by listlessness
and
not really knowing what to do
many many people
it is shocking to me of many of the
super humans
um in silicon valley and elsewhere
when they were
when they were creating their own
craft
when they were making their own art
they
did everything their own way
and
when
they achieved what they wanted to
achieved or at least mostly what they
wanted to achieve
they then delved into this thing called
spirituality and in self-optimization
and self-development
and self-improvement
and when they delve into that arena
they they went completely against their
own
principles
they went against their own grain
whereas in their craft they didn't
listen to anybody
they did things
according to what their instincts told
them
when they dealt into the world of
self-development and spirituality
they began to listen to the so-called uh
experts experts the traditionalists
and they did everything that they never
did
in the creation of their own great craft
that's
that's actually the the norm
and it's very
puzzling to me why
uh humans would do that why superhumans
would do that in particular um
you know they they follow the traditions
of the 20 minutes a day of meditation
and they're going to
uh the silent retreats and the reading
of books and
and all the
you know human beings love to subscribe
to fashions so that they can show off
uh so that they can demonstrate how
intelligent they are by saying that i've
read 20 books and how many of you read
you know it's the new fashion statement
as to how many books that you've read
and how many silent retreats that you've
been to and that you're this new age and
progressive sort of individual
who is um
who is
you know going above the mainstream
by delving into indian spirituality
because it makes you somewhat cultured
or it or you believe that it optimizes
you and
quite frankly i i think that's sort of
silly i think that's beneath
the dna of the superhuman if the
superhuman was going to be
a true artist in his own domain then why
should he succumb to the status quo in
any domain that he touches so if he is
truly serious
about so-called spirituality and
self-development then the first thing
that he'll do is is begin to
approach it in the way that is similar
to the way that he approached his own
craft by debunking all of the nonsense
before he accepts one single word but it
doesn't seem to be that way it seems
that when
um you know
great
people from other domains come to this
world they seem to fall hook line and
sinker for the traditions and the status
quo and they hire a meditation
instructor with a ponytail
uh in a uh an england and an eastern
accent
and they begin to
you know change their name to some
indian name and
chant and they think they're getting
somewhere and that's very much of going
through the motions if you truly want to
get somewhere if you want to become
serious then let's talk let's talk about
that right now
so in all these years that you have left
what are you going to do
are you going to meditate them all away
hopefully become a little bit more
peaceful a little bit more happy a
little less conflict in your
relationships so everything is very
menial everything is
two percent this and five percent this
and all this nonsense that you're taught
well well if you're gonna if you're
ultimate in your own craft then why do
you succumb to nonsense and these other
things so if you are going to be serious
about it then get serious let's talk
seriously about that
um ask any of your meditation
instructors if they can turn off their
thought at will ask them that i didn't
say if they can meditate i didn't say if
they can practice mindfulness and all
the silly nonsense drivel i say can you
turn off your thoughts at will can you
switch off your mind when you want when
you want to turn it off
do you have the ability to say to your
mind you can now speak and now you must
stay quiet and your mind listens to you
when emotion gets to you are you able to
understand that emotion has nothing
whatsoever to do with you not
intellectually but viscerally
organically naturally has that arisen
within you have you have you called have
you cultivated the understanding that
the things that you read in books
actually you can discover by reading
yourself by going deep inside yourself
and then you can know anything and
everything because all of nature's
secrets are embedded within you rather
than rather than reading 400 words 400
pages or something that can be said in a
paragraph and a half and yet so that you
can go to cocktail parties and brag
about how you've read 15 books this year
you know it's it's all it's all social
posturing that's all this is you know if
you're serious then get serious don't
find a meditation instructor find out
what exactly it is that you want find
out what exactly is the outer limits of
possibility for you then you're actually
getting somewhere and you're not getting
somewhere so that you can say that you
got somewhere it actually changes the
complexion of your entire life
experience
the mind is a
complete illusion it creates nothing but
illusion and all of one's reality is
created by this mind now when someone
hears that when the so-called tradition
follower hears that the tradition
following superhuman hears that he will
then delve further into intellect so
that he can have quote intelligent
conversations with his peers in order to
demonstrate how much he knows
so he'll ask questions like what is
consciousness and what is the best way
to practice mindfulness and
is all of this a simulation and and how
is it that you can um
pursue life extension and all of these
these pseudo-intellectual nonsense it's
just jargon no one's real none of these
people are really interested in really
getting anywhere
the most fundamental of which is can you
turn off involuntary thought
that is an absolute superpower
and it isn't just to have
the superpower it is that when
involuntary thought is turned off one
arrives at the truth ones that all the
things that one is seeking through these
meditations and mindfulnesses and all of
these ponytail type you know chasing of
the eastern
eastern tree is
all of these things come for free
without effort
if one is truly sincere if one truly
wants to get somewhere as opposed to
where the shiny you know the the orange
robe and to light the incense and and
you know all of the the fashion trends
of the quote spiritual world if you're
truly serious you actually have the dna
as a superhuman
to
then
turn that dna in this direction so that
you can cultivate and discover what the
truths really are the same way that you
discovered them in your own profession
which is why you became legendary in
your own profession so why would you why
would you acquiesce why would you bow
down
uh to the status quo and
and the the common thinking if you never
did that in your own profession you know
that happens a lot in golf as well you
see executives who are absolutely world
class and they come to golf and they and
they hire a golf instructor to tell them
where to put their left arm how to stand
how tall to
put their make their posture
what the first move away with the swing
is and they spend 30 years and never get
anywhere and i've always been fascinated
that that you're the person who went
against everything in your own domain
and yet you come and you fall for the
traditions and the culture when you were
a complete anti-culturalist in your own
profession which is why you became great
why do you think it's any different than
anything else every culture is smitten
and saturated by
trivial ideas regurgitated concepts and
nonsense it is not based upon truth
so if you're going to study as a
superhuman if you're going to delve into
the world of so-called spirituality
then pursue it from the standpoint of
mind discover what it is that you really
want discover what it is where it is
that you want to arrive not what you
want to practice so that you can show
off and demonstrate how much you
practice you know get serious the same
way that you were serious in your own
profession become serious here because
the same things that you would not
listen to in your own profession are the
same things that are going on here
the mind
is a
um
is the sort of final frontier that space
could not hope
uh to match
this mind creates for us the entire
reality that we believe to be true and
because we believe to be believe it to
be true these beliefs have consequences
and our entire life our actions are
based upon
the beliefs that the things that we hear
and that we think
and that we are told are true and that
is a
massive departure from reality which is
exactly why we suffer from emotional
turmoil and sadness and depression and
sorrow and
endlessly chasing the
mythological idea of happiness which
does not exist there is no happiness the
only reason the idea of happiness even
exists
is because misery is everything
if there was no misery there would be no
happiness so happiness is a is a
concocted idea
that is uh
created in as a reaction to misery and
the reason that misery exists because
the truth is not known
whenever the truth is not known then
what is known in place of the truth are
concepts
and these concepts are heavily flawed
and because they're heavily flawed
acting upon them creates confusion
confusion creates failure failure
creates sadness
this creates a destruction of
relationships this creates a
a massive hole
in seeing what is really there it saps
one's clarity
so
truth peace clarity insight
leads to dispassion
it leads to
a person who was untouched by no matter
what happens to him that's a holy grail
that regardless of what may happen to
you you are unaffected if you choose to
be affected you may be if you choose not
to be you are not
that is
becoming truly in coming truly into
one's own that is becoming a true
superhuman not just in one's craft but
in this final frontier this is a
this is
worth devoting a lifetime to so the
superhuman
if you're listening
be super human in all things
not just in the craft
that you pursued and understand that if
you come to a new domain
that you know very little about that
virtually everything that you hear will
be wrong
the same way it was wrong in your own
profession
be serious get somewhere the mind is
truly the final frontier
good night
the title of this podcast is
prescriptions are for the unserious
there's been a lot of questions over
uh a number of years regarding
my take on
what i call prescriptions and by
prescriptions i don't just mean
um
sort of medication prescriptions and
things like that by prescriptions i
essentially mean
a how-to
a technique-based
and methodology-based
view on things and if we examine society
in any domain in any discipline
uh even if you were to do a google
search on a particular topic
essentially 100
of what you would find
is that
it would all be based upon the viewpoint
of this is how you do it
if you want to overcome
depression or sorrow or you want to
become
more joyful or if you want to develop a
certain skill or if you want to become
better at
something in business or in sports
whatever it may be
the only angle that is available
through the auspices of society
is the idea of
a prescription and a methodology and a
five-step plan and a
10-step way to do this and essentially a
a litany of list posts
uh concerning
the
the method and the in the
in the technique uh by which to pursue
something now what is wrong with that
well it isn't really a question of right
and wrong
and i think the first and foremost the
thing that needs to be understood is
that
if one adopts the idea that one should
not
pursue prescriptions
that would be short-sighted that would
lead to
um
problems in its own right and the reason
that that would is because
and that would also become a
prescription
so the idea isn't that you shouldn't
follow prescriptions it really is an
understanding
it really is a
um a nuanced examination
of
why this happens to be the case
so if you if you examine a prescription
and someone says to you well this is how
you do it now if it's a mechanical like
turning a screw or hammering a nail or
things along that line which are
essentially basic actions
that require
essentially no form of great art
uh then that you know prescriptions are
are fine and how to turn on a computer
very basic
mechanical level things
but anything besides that anything that
involves skill or
the domain of art or emotion
or anything at all that relates to the
mind or
how to live in the world or whatever it
may be you're developing a skill in
which you become world class at
prescriptions have
essentially
no place whatsoever
and the reason
is
that when you are told how to do
something
what will inevitably happen is that the
mind will begin to focus upon the how
it'll begin to focus upon the thing that
is being said
as opposed to
the thing that the how happens to be
about there is an old saying that if you
uh point your finger at the sky
the world will look at the finger and
miss the sky and it is very
poignant uh in in the setting of
prescriptions
everything in the society is based upon
let me show you
what the right way is and what the wrong
way is
if you look at for instance
self-development which
i think largely is um
is a farce self-improvement
self-development
because it is all based upon
prescriptions you should do 20 minutes
of meditation you should practice
mindfulness you should practice loving
kindness you should do this that in the
other
and
and what will happen is that the people
will begin to do that
by doing that they will hope that
because i did this this should lead me
somewhere
and that
isn't really how anything works because
if that was true and it's best just look
at the evidence if that was true
then
the millions upon millions who meditate
and practice mindfulness
would become buddhas they'd become
enlightened they'd become
self-realized whatever word that you
want to use
and
i think that anybody can see that that
simply isn't isn't the case
so prescriptions are not the road to
anywhere except prescriptions
prescriptions and how to's lead only to
prescriptions and how to's
if i say to you well what you must do is
practice mindfulness and meditation for
instance
then what will happen is that you will
do the mindfulness and you will do the
meditation
and then you will wonder well where is
the result where where is the
enlightenment where is the
uh
the freedom for involved from
involuntary thought where is the peace
how come and have it hasn't arrived yet
and that question you will keep asking
um but it will never really arrive
because you are pursuing it by way of an
intermediary and so if you go back to
the person who who says that the
invariably what you'll get is well you
haven't practiced it long enough or you
must do it in a different way or you
aren't quite doing it right and if you
do it right then it will quote work but
if we examine um
for instance monks you know who live in
uh
in monasteries
you know they practice meditation and
mindfulness for hours upon hours every
single day
far more than even the most
committed and devoted meditator
in in society and to be honest they
don't get anywhere either
they are essentially following the
prescriptions of their religion or their
their path um
if you look at buddha buddha when he
first went into the forest
you know acidarta
and he met the ascetics and the ascetics
essentially gave him a load of
prescriptions you know he was eating
uh one grain of uh was one grain of rice
per day drinking his own urine became
emaciated
you know um
really
really you know set in the rain day and
night uh
you know his flesh began to rot um
and which is fine if that's the price
that you must pay he was willing to pay
it but what he realized after six or
seven years is that he was no closer to
enlightenment than he was when he first
came to the forest and frankly the
ascetics who were telling him to do
these things
had been doing it far longer than he had
and they had gotten nowhere
and i think the reason was
was that the ascetics really weren't
interested in enlightenment i think the
ascetics were interested in being
ascetics
and that's what they got
but he wasn't there to be an ascetic he
was he was told that if you are an
aesthetic then the ascetic is the
intermediary to becoming enlightened and
when he learned that that simply isn't
the case he left on his own
and he
sat under the bodhi tree and he said my
bones may rot and my skin may weather
and i may die but i will not arise from
this place until i reach enlightenment
now that sincerity that was seriousness
um
it wasn't that if i meditate
you know this long then it will come
because if that was going to happen then
the ascetics who told him to do that
they would have become enlightened and
they never did
so
this whole idea is is so embedded within
the fabric of society and within the
mind of human beings that it is so
invisible
it is never even examined um if you were
to tell someone well you know
you don't approach things by way of a
how-to he would say what do you mean of
course what else is there there's only
the how
and the same thing happens in business
and in professional sports it's all
based upon the how whenever a
a professional golfer for instance does
not do well in a tournament
the place that he always goes after the
the tournament is to the range
in order to work on his technique even
though he's been playing golf for
20 30 40 plus years
so something must have gone wrong with
this technique that day that he needs to
address um you know there's this
constant chase
of things and
the the chase really has nothing to do
with anything
um it isn't it isn't based upon any
reality it is just that this is the only
thing that the world knows
uh in many ways i don't blame the
professional golfer for doing that
because that's all he's been told
and that's all that
uh society
has been
sort of repeating through the megaphones
as well as in his culture for his entire
career that's all he's ever known it's
all about technique there is nothing
else so
prescriptions and how to's
lead to enormous limitation they just
create more questions if you're told how
to do this then you will come back and
say well am i doing it correctly and
then the person will say no you're doing
it this way when it needs to be done
this way then you'll go back and correct
your
actions or thoughts or behaviors or
habits whatever they may be then you'll
come back and then you'll say well is
that correct and the person will say
well that's that's you're doing better
just just keep doing it and so forever
and ever and ever you were always
wearing a blindfold you were always
blind allowing someone else to lead you
by the hand
and you you work by way of faith you
work by way of a promise that if i do x
and y then something will one day arrive
and whenever something is done by way of
faith or promise it never really arises
the things that you have in your life
are things that you did not arrive at by
faith or promise they were things that
you had to have and therefore you could
not you could not risk relegating them
to faith and promise because you had to
have them it is only the things that you
don't really
that you may want but you don't have to
have that they are not um
life and death to you
those are the things that you will
relegate to prescription because
subconsciously you know
that even if you don't get them it's
sort of all right the things that you
absolutely have you will one way or
another create your own how and that's
how things
work
when you know the what you will create
your own how
if you have understanding as to what
creates what what is the causality that
creates a particular effect
you being invested with that
understanding
will allow you to move forward on solid
ground with open eyes
knowing what produces what and what does
not produce what therefore you will not
move forward based upon faith based upon
the words of another based upon a
promise based upon
aesthetics
telling you that you should meditate and
practice mindfulness in order to achieve
enlightenment as they did to
siddhartha so
you see this all the time across all
domains you know the people who become
great are never the ones who follow
prescriptions to get there
because if you did
then essentially
anyone else could follow the same
prescription and get to the same place
and so the greatest ceos and the
greatest professional athlete and the
greatest performing artist the greatest
you know singer
and the greatest writer
you could follow their quote
habits if you'd like you can follow uh
you know what they do on a daily basis
and the mechanical and physicality of
what they do
but you won't you won't get there
uh you won't become them
because they didn't arrive at that by
such mechanical black and white means
they arrived there through uh
circuitous routes that were unplanned
and that were
largely by surprise
but the one thing that got them there
was
a
life-and-death desire to somehow get
there and it wasn't by way of a script
it wasn't by way of five-step plans it
that is i think clear to to everyone
that
simply practicing golf won't make you
tiger woods
because frankly that these experiments
have already been done if you look at
the other players in the pj tour
none of them are tiger woods
and they
are not by any means lazy uh they put in
the time they put in the work that you
know they put in the quote hard work
uh they have their coaches and
instructors and
um so they're doing all that they can
but no one is even close to tiger woods
so so there's your there's more evidence
that it isn't about the doing and the
following and the prescribing and the uh
adherence to various laws and various
rules uh that gets anyone anywhere it is
a it is an
undying desire uh
that that really gets
someone somewhere and the path is always
circuitous it is never a straight line
um it's never clean uh it's never black
and white
it's it's
it's always vague it's always
the truth is always spontaneous
um
it's never ever scripted so
it's the understanding
that
uh a how is an intermediary
in many ways every how is a how not
you could view it that way
and
it would it would actually pan out quite
quite nicely um whenever someone tells
you a how that if you want to achieve
this then what you must do is this this
and this
and that thing isn't mechanical like you
know
give me 20 push-ups and 40 sit-ups and
those are mechanical things once again
but anything that's related to art or
true skill or arriving at a high level
in in your profession
or things like quote self-development or
arriving at a place of peace within
yourself
those things are never ever they don't
have
prescriptions don't have the power to to
create that
um if they did then as i said you would
see buddhas all over the place and you
would see that those who practice
mindfulness would be
um would have conquered the mind and
involuntary thought and yet what that
leads essentially to is just an endless
um
horizon of practice it seems that human
beings are far more enamored by the idea
of practice than they are in in with the
idea of a rival
very few people actually want to get
there
they actually want to play the part
more than they want to get there
uh they're far more interested in
in um
in the idea of of working hard and
putting in the effort and almost
bragging to themselves if not others
that you know look look look at what i'm
doing look at how much effort i'm
putting into it i'm a good person
because i'm practicing x y and z um but
the truth never really is based upon
morality the truth is never based upon
uh what the right thing to do is what or
what the right thing right one thing to
do is the truth is always based upon
what actually works what is effective
so it doesn't really matter
what what you do it really matters where
you really want to go or where where you
really don't no longer want to be
so the sincerity and the seriousness is
what gets anyone anywhere not the
mechanics
not the
methodology not the techno not the
technique
it and that's why i say prescriptions
truly are for the unserious i think
secretly and deep down those who ask how
precisely are those who don't want to
get there i think how is a very it's a
cop-out of a question
because
i think the person who asks how and for
instance who who will ask who will ask
me commonly uses well how do you get rid
of involuntary thought you know as if as
if in a twitter message i can
give you five steps to get rid of
involuntary thought i mean these are
these are other worldly things arriving
at the top of everest i mean these are
these are truly elixirs of of uh
of of mankind
the fact that they can be reduced to a
five-step plan is really really silly
and i think that the person asking that
actually knows that he's sort of just
doing it to pass time
and deep in his heart of hearts he knows
he doesn't want that he would never ask
that kind of question if he was serious
um
he would he he would truly investigate
himself and he would ask
questions that are qualitatively
fundamentally different than just how do
you do that i mean it's almost flippant
to ask a how
how do you become enlightened how do you
stop involuntary thought how do you
conquer the mind how do you become world
class
it's it's almost a flippant uh
question it's it's so unserious that
even the person asking it knows it's
unserious what possible answer could any
human being give to that and if a person
truly gave you an answer and a five step
plan then he would be just as unserious
as the person asking the question so
those who ask how are simply not serious
they don't really really want to know
they just sort of want to go through the
motions and play the game of pretending
to want to know
so so the things that you do the
greatest the things that you are artful
at the things that you are world class
at whatever they may be
are
precisely the things that you know not
how you do
the how
is only completely evident to you for
the things that you don't do very well
because those things are not art art is
in many ways a mystery it comes out of
the blue it happens spontaneously it
catches one by a surprise
you know it is not something that is
mechanical
it is not something that is scripted or
rehearsed
even even giving a speech uh even as i
even as i do this this solo podcast
there's nothing scripted about it
if you if you give a talk on stage to
script it and to plan it and to tell a
joke every 4.2 minutes and to try to
engage the audience and to try to gain
applause and to try to be entertaining
you know those are those are all
quite unserious and silly things because
those are all done for
self-gratification
they are they are done as ulterior
motives in order to gain something from
the audience if you truly wish to give a
good talk
and then you won't really worry if it's
good or not you'll speak from the heart
it'll be genuine it'll be authentic
and there is something within the hearts
of human beings they can recognize that
which is truly
authentic that which is truly genuine
that which is truly
not done in order for gain or for
applause or whatever it may be
i think that those receptors absolutely
exist within us uh whether we realize
them or not and we can feel it we can
sense it we can taste it upon hearing it
whether someone is truly being genuine
or if they're trying to feed us a line
or if they're trying to get something
from us or whatever it may be
so we're not without genuineness and
without sincerity and without
seriousness
there really isn't
any
arrival of any sort
there really is only a going through the
motions and a
uh
it's a plastic approach to things
so this is
these are the reasons why
prescriptions really are a path to
nowhere primarily because those who ask
for them
really are not interested in getting
there
and society
always creates a supply for where there
is a demand and naturally there's always
going to be a demand for unserious
things human beings being human beings
there's always going to be far more
unserious people than there are going to
be serious people therefore the
the supply
for unseriousness is going to far far
uh outweigh the supply for for for
seriousness
so you know the things that i talk about
the things that i mention that the
things that i post you know
this really in some ways it is for
everyone but practically speaking it
really isn't hardly for anyone it's
really for a very small number of people
it is by no means for the masses
because the masses like to have
everything dumbed down they like to have
everything stripped of all its essence
so that it can be reduced to a sound
bite into a five-step plan into a how-to
and a prescription
and certainly
society caters to that and there's
plenty of avenues for that
and frankly that's a match made in
heaven
so
this this really is only for a very
small number of people that people who
truly are serious and recognize that the
number of the amount of years and the
amount of time that we have left on this
earth is very very small
and if one really seeks to get somewhere
then there really is no time to waste
there's no time chasing ghosts
it really is about seriousness and truly
arriving somewhere
so this is
this in whole and in total
uh is is why i say the prescriptions are
fundamentally uh for the unserious
thank you
the title of this solo podcast is
on the creation of pure art
one must examine
what it is that he receives
from something
because that provides the motivation for
doing it
and if
what the human being receives
is
transient and fleeting
then
that's a fairly sure sign
that both the
motivation
and
as a result the
execution of the act was impure
now it must be stated at the outset that
purity
and impurity
are not ideals to follow because ideals
are empty things
if one tries to follow an ideal
um
he or she is trying to live up
to something
whereas
if one is
overcome
by something
if one has a true and genuine allegiance
to something
then that person does not need to follow
the path or any steps
in order to make sure that he is
keeping up with that ideal
if something really speaks to a human
being
he can't not do it any other way there
is no choice
if one tries to live up to an ideal
then some days he will be successful in
living up to it in other days he will
fall off
and he will spend the rest of his life
acquiring it and losing it
uh it will become a life of
struggle as it relates to that
particular thing
so human beings actually in life get
exactly what they want
because the greatest desire always wins
and that which one truly and genuinely
desires
he reaches out for it in that very
moment that which he does not desire and
he
approaches from the standpoint of
shoulds and health and
good for you and spiritual and correct
he does in a
prescriptive manner and he does it at
arm's length
because it isn't true to him it is just
something that he's been told that he
should do
and as a result he will be very lukewarm
towards it um in in
when he has time
in a part-time fashion he will reach out
towards it and if he gets it he gets it
if he doesn't he doesn't but he'll keep
a scorecard as to how long he had it and
how long he didn't have it then he'll
discuss it with his friends as to how
many times he's grasped it then he'll
laugh with his friends about how easy it
is to
lose it and
this is an entirely disingenuous affair
so human beings actually get exactly
what they want the things that a human
being has
are the things that he couldn't live
without and the reason that you know
that is because he already has them um
the things that he talks about are the
things that he doesn't want he just
talks about it because that talking is a
surrogate
and as a camouflage for
having to admit the fact that he doesn't
really want it so there's no should want
and should not want uh one has to become
genuine if someone is going to find uh
truth
so as it relates to art
um
the
purity is not an ideal then then what is
the point well it it is
um everyone seeks a as human beings
uh
a sense of otherworldliness a sense of
mystique a sense of magic everyone seeks
an escape from the mundane
and human beings look for this escape in
entirely cosmetic means through
ingestible substances such as alcohol
uh through socialization through
watching television through various
other means and
and
and in the
in the pursuing of such things
one get one
one
approaches these things in a glancing
blow
one never arrives anywhere he just tries
to string together drops of pleasure in
hopes of creating an ocean of of
satisfaction
and
i
it's my instinctive
uh
compulsion to tell you that that does
not work but i don't think that you need
me to tell you that any human being can
examine his life and and see with clear
eyes that if if seeking pleasure truly
did work then the person would no longer
be seeking pleasure
so what is it about purity well it is
only
purity brings satisfaction
um when i when i write a discourse
when i write a private discourse or i
create a solo podcast
what is the motivation you know the
and i'm often asked this question on
twitter and
through emails and even
you know through my uh
my private client consultations and
uh the honest answer is that
um
there there is no
there is no quote motivation
uh
the
the compulsion and the instinctive
um
the instinctive
trigger
is to
achieve the glorious satisfaction that
arrives from
losing myself
so
if if someone was to put a gun to my
head and say
that
now you will do a solo podcast and you
will do
or write a private discourse
and you will do so
in order to be informative
you will do so because it is your job
you will do so because you need to
you know help other people by giving
them information that might help them
i
that gun
might as well go off
because
while
i would be dead if the gun did go off
in my head
i would also be dead if i did it
according to the way that i was told to
do it because providing information is
dead and empty
doing things from the standpoint of a
job and as work
is
i mean that's a corpse
that brings absolutely no satisfaction
and if it doesn't bring me satisfaction
um
then there's no motivation for me to do
it so
it is
it provides an opportunity for me to
lose myself and if i sing a song or if i
write something
that
the
the complete and total dissolution of
the person who's writing it and the
complete and utter immersion in
in the
in the
witnessing of the creation of the words
which do not come from me
in any conscious
or deliberate manner
um
that is
the ultimate satisfaction
and
to to extend that
and to live my entire life
in that state
in which the the horrid and wretched
tragedy called the self
with all its stories and its baggage and
its never ending complexities
does not exist
this
is
the only true satisfaction there is the
attempt to try to get oneself into the
moment
is yet another plastic idea
painted on
the sidewalks of society
because
if one tries to get into the moment
so to speak
then
what he is trying to do is bring himself
into the moment and the moment and the
self are mutually exclusive phenomenon
and it is the same with the creation of
pure art
so the creation of pure art is an excuse
for me
to lose myself
and it must be clearly understood that
me losing myself is not a holy spiritual
altruistic
selfless
or
admirable act
it is entirely utilitarian it is
completely necessary
because living within the self
is such a drastically unsatisfying
proposition
so
the creation of
pure art
lies when one completely
dissolves into
the art
and when
it is amazing
that
how the human
organism is created that when
one loses himself
then the notes that one is able to hit
with such perfection in his songs
that
the
insights that one becomes privy to and
is able to access
from the ether in the other world
just by virtue
of
creating a channel in which those things
can flow through
as a result of having removed the
interference of the self
is
truly astounding
man's reach is boundless it is unlimited
but if he tries to
go on that journey
with
this ball and chain called the self
then he is nothing but the perfect
example of limitation
so the purity of art
is art expressing itself
through the human
it is not
the manufacturing of an art
from the human
the purity of the art
is the result of the human dissolving
into the art
and in the end it is precisely this that
all human beings seek
they seek
the disillusion of the self
in losing themselves in things like
socialization and inju in ingesting
exogenous substances
because they cannot stand
living with this self
and it's
it's tragic history and its enormous
baggage
and all of the stories and the dramas
that never go away and which can never
be fixed
every human being seeks freedom from
this
and this is what human beings do not
realize
so all that is done
without the self all that is done
which
is from the standpoint of annihilation
of the idea of a self
is
something which supports and cultivates
and tills the soil
for the growth of true art
good night
the title of this discourse is lunch is
for wimps
let's say um
a quote from gordon gekko
uh
it was a character from
oliver stone's masterpiece called wall
street
essentially that is symbolic for
the idea of
socialization
and
the truth
that those who truly become great
tend to be against the grain in every
way not the least of which is
isolating themselves from the traditions
and the
common ways
of
people in society
you know this discourse really is about
teaching you what to do or
just like all the other things that i
write it really isn't to
tell anyone what to do because those
things generally go nowhere
the question
and it's all about questions the
question is not whether one should
socialize or not socialize or whether he
should be in a group or
isolate himself
there is no right or wrong there's
there's nothing for me to tell you or
anyone else what
is the right thing to do or the wrong
thing to do
rather it's about
understanding that
society can only bring someone down now
if someone is already down in society
he's not going to really harm them
because the conditioning is already
complete and or
that individual does not have that sort
of dna
that
um
that is really
threatened by society
but they're amongst elite circles
in business and in sports and in all
domains
uh
there is a
obviously the the traditions and the
natural way of being of human beings um
is to socialize is to get together is to
have a cocktail party is to have
uh you know group dinners and
and
there's nothing wrong with that or right
with that
but i think that something often goes
uh missed
and that is that those things are seen
as completely harmless and or
a way to
derive a sense of pleasure
um
without producing any
uh untoward side effects i think that's
a mistake
the recognition
that
socialization
has a cost
is a recognition that is lost on the
vast majority of people
because it is seen truly as
as harmless
whatever environment
an organism exposes
him or him or herself too
that organism has no choice whatsoever
whether
he or she will become conditioned
by that environment
no one is powerful enough
to remain immune to conditioning
that i think is a fundamental truth
um that must be realized and
and it will
and
the truths that i talk about generally
are
uh
generally are best
imbibed
by those who are elite in their craft
because
those who are already elite tend to be
very sympathetic and have an
open eye and an open ear
for ways to become elite in all parts of
their life their dna is already there
so now it's just a matter of shining
that light in a different direction
those who are not elite and or who don't
have any interest in being elite
no one starts from zero and gets to a
hundred it doesn't really happen those
are those are nice sort of
rags to riches stories but they're not
true uh it it
they may be true from a financial
standpoint that one had nothing and
their friend ended up becoming wealthy
that's fine but that dna was always
there they didn't start from zero so
uh
these things are not for the masses
these things are not for the people who
don't have that sort of desire slash dna
slash sincerity slash seriousness uh so
these are for the people who already
have something of a dna
uh and or who have already gotten there
so to speak in a particular domain
um
they have a lot to lose the person who
is elite in his domain has a lot to lose
by socialization because whatever group
that he finds himself amidst
it it may be that there's one person
there who
he can truly
benefit from
from a conditioning perspective
but the that's very unlikely it is it is
virtually certain that the vast majority
in most in most cases all the people
who he socializes with
are going to bring him down
in ways that he does not realize
um
that's the danger if someone brings you
down in ways that you realize then you
can do something about it you can
counteract it you can stop
associating with that person it becomes
evident but the danger really is in the
things that are not seen
human beings will always regress towards
the mean always just like water that
laps the edge of
a rocky shore
over time erodes that rocky shore
that rocky shore has no choice but to be
eroded
so
you know a lot of times there's a habit
of doing things because you sort of fall
into habits without knowing that you're
doing them and because everyone else is
doing them too it's never questioned but
you know if you examine what what um
you know you being among the elite if
you examine what you say at these
parties and the things that you discuss
and the jokes that you laugh at
and
the
the topics that are talked about
it's all drivel
i mean of what meaning is it of what
significance is it um what
what is it besides just passing the time
so you know that's those are these are
these are these are very
um
low level things for someone who himself
isn't low level
uh and and each time that is done
then one imbibes subconsciously things
that
sort of takes the edge off
of his uniqueness
it sort of dulls the sharpness
of
his rarity
and
the very recognition
that that is at risk that his uniqueness
and his rarity and his originality
that those things are at risk i think
changes the game
because then one does not view
uh socialization
um as harmless
everything in this life has a cost
everything
from the things that are most menial
to the things that
are most apparently significant
nothing is free
so
the person who truly seeks the truth
about these things
um
will recognize that there is a cost to
socialization as well
you know i'll go so far as that
virtually all the friends that an elite
person has
are not to his benefit
they are to his detriment
they are bringing him down
whether he realizes that or not
so the person who realizes these things
if he isn't already a loner or if he
isn't already a recluse if he isn't
already an isolationist
he will see the practical benefit
of being so
and this is not
any sort of recommendation that one
should be
it is
in seeing the truth
one is able to make up his own decisions
as to what will benefit him most and
what will bring him harm
so overall socialization is is an
incredible waste of time
um
if there is a very particular
reason for it one seeks to make a
particular connection
in their business or one needs to meet
someone that could be
of
that he could provide value to and the
other person could as well you know
those are those are strategic and
potentially beneficial things
um
but in those situations one is going in
with their eyes open they're going in
with a with a particular focus
as opposed to
going in
um
unguarded
and going in unguarded is where is when
the floor falls out
that's when problems usually arise
whatever you do
with open eyes
it tends to not not hurt you
but the things that you are unaware of
the things that you become blindsided by
um those things happen
as a result of not knowing
the domain in which you're walking into
where the traps lie so to speak
so
you know if you watch human beings you
know it's said that human beings are
social creatures i i'm not
i i have no evidence for that i'm not
certain that that's the case i i know
for a fact that human beings like to
justify what they do and they justify
the status quo
um and since they enjoy being social
it's very easy to say that they were
meant to be
social creatures um but
of what benefit is this socialness that
happens
much of social media is
is an insult
posting pictures of you know silly
things and and people talking about you
know them walking their dog today i mean
these are the this is valuable human
time that never returns that is being
spent
on frivolousness
the
the
uh addiction to
smartphones and internet and
the proliferation of these things is
is is an enormous cost to the quality of
human life
um human beings just waste their lives
across the board whether it is the elite
whether it is the common they all waste
their lives the question is how much of
their lives have they wait are they
wasting and it is the it is the dramatic
realization of that on a visceral level
that one is indeed wasting their life
even though
they may have
earned billions of dollars and created
great things or become a superstar
that's that's fine but
the fact that one is still wasting their
life
is a realization that when it hits home
to one or maybe two people
that's a game changer that
that has a
fairly pronounced impact
that
that has the power to have them change
course and once again it isn't my
recommendation that they should change
course um the the the
my desire to change someone is um
practically non-existent it
you know
i
um
i find that these things are of value to
speak about largely for myself i i enjoy
speaking about things that are
deep and are not seen in society
and this is this is very much one of
them socialization is a largely a
complete waste of time it is the filling
of empty space
um and frankly so is the idea of
productivity productivity is busy work i
mean that's a podcast for another day
but productivity is busy work
it means so what that you got
20 things done today um
they're not most of those things are not
significant anyways so
the quality of life is really a matter
of engagement
how lost and how engaged something is in
the creation of something not that the
creation of it to be honest actually
matters
but the quality of the life
um is at its peak
when someone is fully engaged
in something
as opposed to doing things for an
ulterior motive or as opposed to doing
things because it's quote good for them
or because it's quote healthy
so
this is a view on socialization that i
uh that society does not offer up uh in
fact it's the opposite society
creates groups and institutions and
conferences and
meetings and social events and cocktail
parties and
get-togethers and cookouts and all of
these things in order to bring people
together to talk about drivel
take this for what you will i have no
recommendations
but
gekko is right
lunch is for wimps
good night
