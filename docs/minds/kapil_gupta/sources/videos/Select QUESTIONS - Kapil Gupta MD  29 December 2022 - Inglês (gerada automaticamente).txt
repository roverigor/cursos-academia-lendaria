hi Dr keppel
I am a bit curious what you think
is going on when
we play this shell game of creating
desires we tell ourselves
we really want and care about
but at the same time we're
non-serious about
actually
doing the activities to achieve that
thing and
you know
reach that goal or get into that
position or acquire that thing
[Music]
um
what do you think
people are actually doing when they
fabricate that kind of situation for
themselves
that's just what's going on what you
just described
hi doctor I recently looked into
astrology a lot and I want to hear
what's your Viewpoint about astrology
hi I just wanted to check in and ask how
you are doing personally and to just
check in with everybody else
um while
uh hello Dr Gupta
um many things are very fleeting the
pleasure emotions even desires that uh
that seem to kind of come and go
um but there's still a sense of a
constant a center that exists that
carries that gets carried from day to
day from moment to moment is that sense
of a center or some core an illusion
it doesn't matter you feel it so you
feel it it doesn't matter what it is
it's that would just be an intellectual
um
that would that would just be in an
intellectual piece of knowledge it
wouldn't be anything that you can do
anything with so there's no point in
talking about it
hi Dr Gupta um you've disparaged intro
music and podcasts and stuff in the past
and I'm wondering what made you decide
to use it today
I didn't use it
I haven't been on Twitter spaces in a
while
and when I came on the music just came
on and I didn't know where it came from
so then I disabled it oh that makes that
makes sense thanks
or do they remain the same
no fundamental truth is a fundamental
truth Society changes truths don't
can truth be
explained or
is it just no
no it can be explained
but the but
but the
person on the receiving end
must have a significant amount of
bandwidth
um in order to
understand it
hey yeah I was just wondering what does
it take to
have that
bandwidth to receive that explanation
that exists well that it it really isn't
a
prodigious amount of in
telligence in fact
intellectualism really is
um
a blockage it's a barrier the bandwidth
is typically in in the setting of
devotion sincerity seriousness the DNA
to truly and genuinely and deeply want
to know for its own sake
does that come with the experience
no
thank you
hey I was wondering how do you remove
the ego or kill the ego
at Detroit is there a way to test or
hey Kapil thank you for doing these
spaces I just had a question about money
so I realize money is required for
survival when it comes to buying food
buying shelter whatever but what role
does money play when it comes to freedom
because I understand maybe that you know
if I want to go a place I need I need
money to do so
but is money something that actually is
a requirement for truth
is money a requirement for truth
um it depends on what in what aspect
you're talking about I mean
could someone devote himself to truth
and live on live uh in a homeless
fashion
um absolutely but he would have to
sustain himself
in some way even to pursue the truth
because without food he wouldn't be able
to live
so in order
in order to to walk the path of Truth
one must have money so that
um all of one's
needs can be taken care of
which allows him the freedom to then
seek the truth but does one like I said
one could live in a cave and eat berries
and pursue the truth and the barriers
could sustain him so in that sense no
thank you
thank you for taking my question
um I wanted to build off the last
question
there's no balance
because if you're speaking of balance
then you're doing it because you think
it's a good thing to do
nothing happens by way of
um this this forced and fit into its own
place moderation in a little of this and
a little of that those things are for
meager things
those are not for ultimate things
there's no balance
it is about what one truly Desires in a
Savage way more than anything else
it isn't it isn't incremental it isn't
it it isn't in moderation
those are for commonworldly things they
are not for things that are uh that are
other worldly and ultimate the only
he wasn't ready for that answer
um with regards to exposure
um how
How Deeply do the things we're exposed
to affect us
so well if you examine your own life
um what you have been exposed to is the
world
your whole life
for however many years you've been alive
the world of society its principles its
tenants all the things that the people
around you told you all the things that
your friends told you the things you
read in books the things you watched in
the media all the things that you've
been exposed to
um look into your own mind just look
look at the things that you say and
speak look at your behavior patterns and
look specifically at what you have not
accomplished be it on in the
professional but more importantly in the
realm of life
and that will tell you how deep How
Deeply the exposure has affected you
would you describe meditation as going
back to Source or checking in with sort
you're not ready for any real response
because you were too blindfolded and
brainwashed by spirituality
even if I realize that every time I lie
in my my my voice and I had like my
thoughts are in aligned with what I
actually want right and my mind is
always lying it still feels as if
there's still an eye there right so
isn't it I that justifies I
exactly
it doesn't matter it's all in the
intellectual upon intellectual upon
intellectual
hello sorry could you hear me
I think my connection is is like
I could build hi how would you describe
a world where everyone is free truly
free
there's no world of free
there's only world of nonsense and
poison
if you want to do anything do it for
yourself forget the world
be more giving and giving
um
but how do you be more comfortable
without the fear of someone why do you
want to be giving
is self-realization only way for
enlightenment
all those terms have no meaning
so I've already responded to you I said
I missed that sorry could you repeat it
please why do you want to be giving
uh good question
hi doctor
um in a podcast you had said quote the
things that we do the greatest uh we
know not how we them you also said that
this is because the details of what we
do best are not full and not knowable
um I was I was wondering if you'd be
able to expand on this specifically how
can it be that the details of what we do
best unknowable even to ourselves
do you have a talent
I like art and I dabble in art
I am talented in it by any means okay so
what what are you what are you talented
in what are you good at
I would say if I had to say like if I
would say that if I had a tone it would
be art
okay how do you do the art
I like to paint
and recreate them with different mediums
okay how do you recreate them
I lean on the photographs as a reference
um
okay so if someone else did not have
that talent and they leaned on the
photograph would they be able to produce
what you produced
not in the same way but I guess that's
what makes it art
well that's why I'm going to ask you
every single thing that you do
and you're going to tell me the
physicality of what you do and the more
that I ask you the less answers that
you're going to provide
that makes a lot of sense thank you
can you hear me
um do children learn languages
so easily in part because they have
quote unquote No mind
thank you Dr Gupta
wondering if you would share your
thoughts on sexual relations like
between a human being I mean between any
uh two
how do you break an addiction
hello Dr Gupta
um why does the mind sometimes listen to
you and sometimes it does not
does it have to do
foreign
I was wondering if my instinct is
equivalent to the truth
no
thank you
thank you for taking my question
um I was wondering if you had any advice
on balancing my pursuit of power and
authority and my
uh thank you for taking my question
um the exposure to your work changes me
a lot from inside and makes me very
different person
but then again closer to the society
changes me back to the defaults
I'm not asking for a prescription here
but is Solitude the only solution like
just staying alone because I didn't get
exposed to the society and again restore
to defaults
it's about what you choose to expose
yourself more to
um
foreign
I have listened to your
um
your discourses and the like for several
years now and it has um changed my life
radically both internally and materially
but in the last couple of weeks I
realized I still hadn't gotten
completely serious and I had just been
wasting my life and I decided that was
that time it ended
and in the last couple of weeks I have
been seriously inquiring into where my
anxiety arises from and when it comes
when it when it appears and it doesn't
appear to come from actual events that
happen but from when my mind creates a
scenario about what might happen to me
in the future
and I realized that I really must
overcome the mind at all costs
and so my question is what do I need to
understand about the mind so that I can
be effective I mean there's a lot
there's no way that I can tell you a
a quick thing to understand that will
help you overcome the mind
um I mean that's that's like trying to
drink the ocean
there's no way that I can tell you that
I mean that that's a it's a
long-term systematic serious Journey uh
to of exploration to doing that that
there's no way I can tell you X and
that'll help you it's it's almost it's
really a ridiculous question
um the the sincerity from which it
arises is is nice
um but the the question itself really is
not answerable in that in this type of
format
what you know is the truth
um thank you so much for taking the
question I've been following your work
for
probably a two years now and uh it's
completely changed my life
and so first of all I'm extremely
thankful for everything you do and it's
honestly a an honor to talk to you and I
almost can't believe you exist because
I've been I feel like I've been
searching for you for my entire life so
thank you for everything you do
um
because my question is sometimes when I
feel like um
I'm in search of
a truth for any given situation
I go through an intellectual exercise to
get to the to the to the Bedrock of that
truth and I wonder if I'm sometimes it
takes me longer to get there and
sometimes I'm not even sure if I'm at
the Bedrock because I'm using my mind to
understand it so
I was hoping you could well using
intellectualism to get there is all you
know
and when something's all you know then
that's all you're going to use the more
you learn about the truth the more you
will be
cognizant of that fact and therefore you
won't fall so easily for that trap but
thank you for your words
is it possible to consciously uh alter
the self-image of oneself
