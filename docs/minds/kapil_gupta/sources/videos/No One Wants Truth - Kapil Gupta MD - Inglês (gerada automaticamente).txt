no one wants truth there may be a
handful in the entire world but not more
than that no one wants truth it is
understandable for man is a creature who
seeks very little
what he wants is to be told nice stories
taste sweet things and watch plays on a

useless and empty prescriptions for
decades believing Concepts that have
nothing to do with reality are never
coming to truth is in all Shucks to them
if one gets stage four pancreatic cancer
he still has months and days to live and
if a man lives but a single day in truth
he can experience freedom such a life is
not a wasted life but one who is
conditioned by lies and prescriptions
could have 73 more years to live and it
is a complete waste a death sentence is
