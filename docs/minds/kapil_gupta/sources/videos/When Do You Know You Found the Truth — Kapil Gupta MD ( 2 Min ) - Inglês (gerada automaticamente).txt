there seems to be a lot of
misunderstanding about a truth
or the truth what the truth really is
i know it's personal for each of us
when do you know that you found it
well it's a feeling you know you found
it it's a feeling
and you know the truth isn't isn't it's
an it isn't
a a a fact or a nugget that you go
out to find it is everyone is suffering
through various things everyone is
pursuing various things in their life
and the things that mean most to them
whatever it may be be it their
profession or be it in their personal
life or be it
anxiety or or becoming world number one
and whatever it may be and
and each of those things has a truth it
has a truth
that is indivisible incontrovertible
it is hard rock basement
truth the source from which
that anxiety let's say arises
or the source from which that world
number one comes from
there's a truth and if it isn't a truth
it's a chase
so that's what truth means that there
there is
there is a there is a way and the way is
never a method i
i i hesitate to use the word way because
people
people misconstrue that um a way isn't a
method
it means that there is literally a truth
as to the way to get somewhere
but that is never methodological or
technique based
or prescriptive so it is about hunting
for
what is the real truth
about where i want to go what the source
of my wanting to go there is
is it pure is it not what is the truth
of whether i
chase purity as a prescription to follow
or if i am chasing purity
because purity is really really connects
deeply with me
there's a truth behind all those things
there's an honesty there is a
genuineness
that's what is meant by truth truth
isn't about discovering a bunch of facts
or a bunch of knowledge it is it is a
wholehearted
uh pursuit of the essence
and the true cause of the effect that
one seeks
