kapil gupta is a personal advisor to
some of the world's most successful ceos
professional athletes and entertainers
and as you're about to find out his
advice
is uh not conventional to say the least
so kapil great to be with you
thank you mo pleasure to be here
you are certainly one who is as
iron-clad
about his view of the world and life in
general
as anyone that i have met
so for those hearing us have this
conversation for the first time
what is the most important thing
that people need to know about you
the most direct answer i can give
is that
my god is the truth
elaborate on that for me
in every problem in every situation in
every circumstance
in every deep life issue
there is always a truth
there are ways that you can go left or
right
there are
things that you can advise for and
advise against there are advantages and
disadvantages
but there's always a truth and the truth
is never logistic
and the truth is never mechanical
and it isn't one decision that's more
right than another decision
it is about where that decision comes
from it is the source
of the decision
which categorizes it as truth or not
so that is my holy grail that is my
mode of attack
in all things
so
when you're sitting down and talking
with someone that and obviously the
people you work with
have had great achievements in life what
you've just said sounds look so logical
yet seems so elusive to most of us we
none of us want to think
that we're not living our truth but the
truth of the matter no pun intended is
that we're not
what are we missing
the desire to know the truth
it isn't about it it isn't about a
methodology
it isn't about a way
it is
just that
human beings generally are not
interested in the truth
it doesn't motivate them it doesn't
inspire them
um
there is a small subset
who insist upon it
and those are the ones who find it and
those the ones who resonate with it
um the rest of them
simply ask for prescriptions
which i am profoundly
and categorically
against
so for the majority then
what are we running away from what are
we afraid of
i think it's
i think avoidance
is a very
comfortable way
to live
um
i think asking someone for the answer
is a
a very
safe way to live which ends up being
very dangerous in the end
um
you know
i don't i don't think that it really is
about being afraid
i think it just comes down to dna
and i and i don't mean biological dna i
mean
i mean sensibility dna ones one's
natural bent
towards things
um
they're just those people
who for whatever
inexplicable reason
are to just gravitate
towards wanting to know
they love to learn
they they crave
the knowing of
the central
nucleus of the matter
and
i don't think that really
it has i don't think that any
conversation
that stems around the masses
and trying to get the masses to move
is a fruitful conversation
i think it is much more about lateral
moves
and not vertical ones
it is it is difficult and almost futile
to take someone and or attempt to take
someone who has virtually no
interest in the truth at all or only a
curious
sort of
a passing curiosity in the truth
and trying to get that person to this to
look for the truth
that would be a vertical attempt a
lateral attempt is someone who is
already world class in what they do and
by virtue of them being world class
they already
almost by definition
have to be outside the box thinkers
they tend to buck the norm they tend to
move against society
they do things their own way and that's
exactly the dna
of the person who seeks
the truth it is just that now they would
be doing it in different arena but
bringing all those resources with them
so i'm much more interested in lateral
moves than i am vertical one so when you
ask a question which says
what is everyone afraid of the
implication the source of your question
centers around the idea that we should
say something in order to help the
masses
find what they are what it is they're
running away from and if they discover
that then we can help them on the way to
the truth
i have no interest in that
life is very short i am only interested
in the people who are serious enough to
begin with and therefore need a small
catalyst to make a lateral move as
opposed to a massive earthquake to make
a vertical one
so let's talk to the latter let's assume
for a moment we're only talking to the
latter
and you said something to me last week
that i want to dig a little bit deeper
in you said something to the effect that
if i tell somebody the how
to get wherever they want to go
they'll be stuck forever
what do you mean by that yes
all of society whether it is in the
um
what is it whether it's in technical
instruction or spiritual matters
or
coaching or teaching
or in business or in sports whatever it
may be
everyone functions off of an unstated
premise
and the reason it's unstated is that
it's so accepted it's such a given
that it doesn't even need to be stated
and that is that in order for you to do
x
i will teach you how
to do x
now for something some ex from very very
basic
technical things
yes you can get away with that but those
things don't have really
much uh
uh artistic significance
um
but
there's a there's a massive problem with
that
the problem is that
if you teach someone how to do something
they will forever be asking you if the
how that they employed
is
the correct how
they will always come back and ask you
was that right
was this correct and i didn't get it
that my how was wrong and then you will
say well yeah you didn't do it quite
this way
no no you were a little bit off here
as a result it's like leading a blind
man
towards
a tree
and he's forever dependent upon you to
tell him to walk to the left or the
right and getting colder or warmer until
he gets there that is that is that is
treating a human being like an invalid
that is that is so disrespectful
to
the
the artistry and the ingenuity
that a human being is born with
that
it basically sabotages all of his
efforts
teaching someone the how
does not create art
it creates dependency
when your best relationships come to you
your best your best clients i know
they're more than clients to you but
when your best relationships comes to
you
what type of questions are they asking
you if they're not asking you how what
type of questions are they asking you
they they do ask how
but they very quickly learn not to
as i did
right i learned really quickly
yes because it's well the paradigm is so
is so completely contrary it is so
antithetical
to society
that it's it's literally a part of the
water
so
you know
why do you ask me what kind of questions
do they ask me why are you asking
because i'm curious
i'm curious for two reasons number one
i know that anyone
that you choose to work with
is on a path to greatness
so they there's a gap that they sense
that that's missing in their life number
one
and number two
i know that the quality of of a person
is in direct proportion to the quality
of the questions he or she asks
so
for those two reasons
i want to get a sense of one
what are the commonalities of some of
these people that you're working with
and what are they working towards
uh
i i think
it would i think it'll
be instructive to give a the flavor
it isn't so much the exact questions
that they ask it is this
it is the
here's the commonality
it is the genuine
desire
to know
the need to learn
is something that is
a part and parcel with their dna
that is one of the greatest
commonalities
infinite learners
yeah
so i consider not infinite but
but but not infinite disciples
and i and let me make a distinction
um
the person who is an infinite disciple
is the one
who doesn't really want to become a
master
he loves the role of disciplehood
and he doesn't necessarily love the
whole of this love the role of
disciplehood
because
it allows him
um
an unending
opportunity to learn
it is much more about
that's who i was meant to be that's
where i feel comfortable i feel
comfortable as this disciple where i
shall remain forever
as opposed to the one who truly wants to
know
he actually wants to become a master
he doesn't want to become a professional
disciple
you have and have developed a very
unique ability
to see something in people whom you work
with
that they don't see in themselves
which in and of itself leads to that
mastery
what is that something that you see or
that you look for
that we most of us don't see
sincere
that is a
single most important
element
that i look for
in anyone
are they sincere and by sincere
um i don't mean if someone's a truth
teller or if he tells fibs what i mean
is by sincere
do you really really
really genuinely want that
or are you playing a curiosity game
i
i desire to work with individuals who
are truly sincere
who are not looking for a tip
who aren't looking for a quote hack to
use modern
modern vernacular it is
it is
a genuine desire
to say yes
i actually genuinely
want that whatever that is
is that pretty easy for you to notice
you can sense sincerity pretty quickly
yes
and and the people
sincerely even in email
oh yeah i can yeah but but you've
developed a really great skill for that
and and
i suppose well i suppose
you
you are hyper attuned precisely to those
things
that
you
look for in a laser-like fashion right
sure
are the people that you see that
sincerity in are they surprised that
they haven't noticed it themselves
they're typically surprised
that
they haven't been sincere
enough
typically how it goes is
that
they f they catch themselves
going down the curiosity
sort of game
and
while there is the dna for sincerity
within them they've lived in a society
which preaches prescription
for so long
that they sort of
you know have drunk that water
and
so
they reflexively go down that path and
begin to ask questions like well how
should i do that and what is the
methodology of that
and
and then we always and i come to the
first session
we're going to circle back to sincerity
about 5 000 times over the next hour
many years and we always do and
and the person always ends up saying
something like
so we're right back to sincerity again
aren't we yes we are we're always going
to return to sincerity not as a
prescription but because
the only reason
that you don't have what you want
is because you didn't really want it
the only reason that you have the things
that you do
is because you couldn't live without
them
and the only reason that you are
where you are
is because somewhere within you it is
okay for you to be there
and the quest for mastery
is never ending
right we're always in pursuit of that
mastery
when do you get a sentence i
i you know
i think
the never ending thing is is more of a
romanticized idea
um uh
i i think that the person who really
wants to be a master doesn't subscribe
to the notion that it's never ending
um i think the one who doesn't really
want it is the one who says it's never
really ending
because he doesn't really want that way
to begin with
so the person who really wants it he
absolutely wants an endpoint so i'll get
messages on social media all the time
about it it's about the destination or
the journey that's the destination you
know all these bumper stickers bumper
sticker sayings and you know like
there's no genuineness behind it
um
it's
it's what do you really want
it is sitting with yourself in a dark
corner and say what do i really really
want and the answer that comes in the
first seven seconds is never the right
one
it's it's a cultivation it's an
exploration
in order to discover that
and without discovering it you chase
ghosts
is there a commonality to what people
want that you work with
is it success in however way they define
it
i don't really think anybody wants
success
um
i think everyone some everyone wants
something
whatever everyone wants is
euphemistic um
the professional athlete will come
looking for performance
performance isn't what he really wants
the ceo will come looking for peace
he doesn't really what he really wants
the want
is never stated outright
the thing that is verbalized
is
the
the masquerader
of the want
the want has to be discovered
never walks in the door
and for those who are not going to have
the privilege
to work with you personally
how do they start on that discovery if
they are deadly serious
about seeking that truth that you're
talking about
don't give them a prescription
give them an uh
paint a picture for me
of what it takes for us to get on that
path
if you are really serious about finding
the truth you will not find it difficult
to throw every book you have about
self-help in the trash
you will not find it difficult to turn
off
the radio and to stop listening to gurus
and to stop reading scriptures
you will not hesitate one bit
because those things do not speak the
truth
those things speaks prescription and
bondage
and adherence to a group
and anything at all that involves a
group is false
all things arise in the individual from
the individual by way of the individual
group think is nonsense
group meditation is a farce
all the things out there from meditation
retreats to silent retreats it's all a
sham these are all scams these are all
fake gurus who line the banks at
rishikesh these are all people who raise
their head and put a ponytail around it
and put
put paint on their face to masquerade as
being a guru
and they're all charlatans
if you really speak the truth stop
following anybody stop asking for
prescriptions the moment that you have a
how you have bondage you have dependency
you will get nowhere
that is something
that must be okay with you
if you truly speak the truth it's okay
with me
so take me on that journey and speaking
of that
what do you notice as the biggest
difference between the people that you
work with
who
get closer to that truth do you see
something in them is there a before and
after they come to you today and they
say hey i am deadly serious i know
you're no i want to go on that
path when do you start to see a change
in them
i will tell you
the honest truth
when i work with someone
i never try to produce a change
and when a change happens
and it gets back to me that some
i guess some
you know
big changes happen in their life
no one is more surprised than me
because i didn't try to make any change
all we did was look at the issues before
us
dissect them
take them apart look at what's there
and prescribe nothing
fix nothing
you do not need to fix anything
you need to see
everything and in the scene
in the quiet examination
the truth reveals itself
so when i hear that someone has become
calm and their wife tells them that
they're totally different now or
their
their friends tell them
how are you like this all of a sudden
and
believe me i'm
i'm very surprised
because i had no strategy
to create that
all things for me had happened
organically
all things with every client i had ever
had
happened organically
they happened
the way things always happened
never buy a goal
always
is a side effect
is there one
relationship that you worked with that
had just astonished you
at the
person that that individual has become
as a result of your interaction
yeah several
give me one obviously without naming any
names uh i've i've i've
i've stopped drinking
i've
stopped using substances
those kind of things
and we
never really discussed that ever
i've um
i've stopped
i've struck i've stopped speeding on the
highway
never in my life i discussed speeding on
the highway
um when i when i when i eat i eat slowly
uh it seems that when i talk to someone
i'm completely and totally there now
when i give a speech i have no idea what
i'm going to say
but all these things just
materialize
like like magic
you know we talked about some common
patterns amongst these individuals or
amongst greatness in general that you're
around
are there common patterns of frustration
that you find in those individuals who
are again deadly serious about that
pursuit
yeah following
the paths that they have followed to
discover
peace or freedom or confidence or
freedom from anxiety or whatever
the frustration is is
always the same it's always
i've done all the meditations and i've
done the yoga and i've tried the
psychotherapy and i've read the books
and i've
i looked through the scriptures and i've
followed the religion
and it didn't get me anywhere
that's a very very
staple of frustration
well it got them somewhere right because
they wouldn't be seeking out to you
unless they've at least some level of
success
well
when i say that they were looking at
those things they were looking at those
things on a personal level that's
independent from their success
in their profession so it's always
interesting that
what someone does in their profession
they tend to do things in a different
way and it's by way of prescription when
they look into a different different
element for instance
you'll see someone who is a great ceo
and then they'll come over to the site
of golf for instance
and they'll take golf lessons and the
golf coach will tell them sixteen
thousand different positions to memorize
and they'll begin they'll become an
invalid
to memorize them when they know very
well that
exactly what made them great in their
own profession was that they went
against all teachers and all instructors
and here they are
doing the exact opposite
of what made them great in their own
profession so it's the same thing with
something like spirituality where they
come over here and say okay well in my
profession i became great in my business
i i created empires and now i come to
spirituality now what are the traditions
that i should go through and that's when
the floor falls out the traditions are
the meditations and the yogas and the
and the you know
retreats and all this nonsense and never
gets them
anywhere so they need to bring that same
outside the box buff the trend they held
with society everyone is wrong the
masses are always incorrect the
prevailing dogma is always wrong they
need to bring that over here too
because that applies to everything
how do you define success
uh
i think that definition gain i don't
know i mean english you know language is
a fabricated creation
so
to turn a word into truth
i i don't i don't think that's very
fruitful well well you know and i was
going to ask you that because i noticed
in the times that we were together
you're very careful with your language
you're very careful with your words
what words do you use to describe that
sense of fulfillment or euphoria
that you're explaining
yeah that's a good question
um
words
the thing about words is that they
always miss
language is a very ineffective tool for
communication
it's
it's sort of like typing on an iphone
with a swollen finger
it it's very imprecise it the word gets
you into the area but it can never
relate the experience
how do you explain the experience
the adult
you talk around it you provide
some descriptive elements of it
which i try to do with my discourses
um
but you can't explain the experience
you can explain things in such a way
which inspires someone
to
go after the experience
but
uh you can never describe to someone the
taste of chocolate
can you at least give me a glimpse
what do what do your best relationship
experience that's so elusive to the
great majority of the world
ask that again
what do the great what do the
individuals you work with experience as
a result of working with you that's so
elusive to the majority of the world
i honestly i there's no way i can answer
that question that's how that's a
question for them
i only know what goes out from me
i don't know how things are received on
the receiving end
they would have to tell me
um
but but i will tell you as for the
experience
i think the ultimate experience is
the very thing that everyone speaks but
they don't realize that even though they
do it all day long
24 7 their whole life and that is
all human beings seek engagement
they seek immersion
they seek to be lost in whatever they do
that is
the central
human
desire
and i concur with that is when they feel
most alive i concur with that 100
percent
so
for you personally
how do you know what you know
how did you get here
that's a very good question um
my knowledge is not my own
it is just that
i know the way to the well
i think that
knowing the truth
isn't something
that you
learn in a book or through some
methodology or technical means
i think it is
i think you receive it through some
form of grace
it is somehow bestowed upon you
when you demonstrate
to
nature
or the universe or to the ether that
immediately surrounds you
that
how genuine and how sincere your desire
for that truth really is
and
when whatever that force is
recognizes that desire
and how genuine it is
it bestows it upon you knowing that it's
releasing it in the safe hands
you've said in a lot of your discourses
and you know a lot of the the
interactions you've had on social media
that
all conflict is self-conflict
which in essence is you know all of it
is mind-made
give me a little bit more on that
whenever you
fight with another
it is your own uncomfortability that
you're fighting with
such that
if one was
complete
and totally content with himself
he could never
be affected to the point of conflict
because no matter what the other person
said
if it was true
then there would be no reason to get
upset
if it wasn't true
then there would be no reason to get
upset
the reason that we get upset
is because we internalize
the
negative things that are directed
towards us
and as we internalize them
that creates an internal self-conflict
and that manifests itself as external
conflict
what did it take for you to kindly get
into that state of being
to live that way
uncompromising desire
do you ever get stressed
yeah i reactively i do and i'll i'll
give you some examples uh or one i'll
give you
probably the most readily available
example to me
is if i you know
wherever i go
i look for places to be alone
when i go to a restaurant and i
see a
group of 15 in one part of the
restaurant i will ask the person to see
this over there in like the back room
somewhere to me every restaurant should
have like a siddha room or something
where you go inside and there's no music
and there's no people and they just
close the door and you can sit quietly
either by yourself or whoever you came
with um
the the what what
if the reactive
sort of
annoyance that i have is if you walk
into a restaurant and like a band starts
playing
that just
kills me because it it destroys my
silence and
i don't know why in this society there
has to be music wherever you go i don't
know why there can't be silence
somewhere there's always got to be a
radio or something playing overhead and
those are the kind of things which like
cut through everything and and really in
a reactive way get to me and then after
that i thought i could calm myself down
you know but those are the kind of
things that
that are incompatible
with my nature how quickly are you able
to calm yourself down are you talking
about instinct yeah
yeah yeah no no i
i
i can calm myself down instantly uh
because i
i recognize that you know
i don't want to be in that annoyed state
that's why i said reactive it's kind of
like
someone poking you in the arm with a
knife you'll react with a flinch right
that's what i mean
uh if it gets too loud i'll just leave
you know uh so but
yeah calm myself down
do you structure your day where you have
more silence and you do noise
yeah wherever i go i had more silence
and
no noise my house is a quiet house so
tvs
basically we have tvs on the wall
which no longer had receivers hooked up
to them
i sent them back a couple of years ago
so
we don't watch tv
i have no radio
uh
but what about when the boys play video
games
so yeah they go play in the basement
that's fine i don't have a problem
so you stay away from the basement
yeah i mean if there's some video games
you want to play
and i hear the video games it doesn't it
doesn't it doesn't bother me because uh
it's
you know it's unaccepted there's an
acceptance accepted level of noise
that i'm okay with
tell me what the role of gratitude plays
in your life
right it's prescription
and that's why i ask
yeah
i don't believe any of those things
i don't believe in any of those things
as a doing
if you're if gratitude comes to you if
compassion comes to you fine if you tell
someone to be gratitude have a gratitude
journal and
i just i just reject all those things
and if someone
gets something out of it i'm not going
to argue i mean i you know i don't care
what you got if whatever if it if
it gives you something then by all means
doesn't matter what i say but if you ask
me what do i think about gratitude i i
say it's a prescription
how about money what is the what's your
relationship with money and how do you
see money or financial freedom
with some of the people that you work
with is there a correlation between
the the suffering that that causes
people
i think money is a bad rap
um
i think i think
it's a romanticized idea to say
that wealthy people are miserable and by
it by
by implication
that
those people who don't have money are
happy i that's that's not true
um
i'm glad you said that
i'm sorry i'm glad that you said that
because i wholeheartedly believe that
yeah
um
there are
there's
wealthy people oftentimes has a guilt
about having money
um
the
society
sort of looks down upon them
for as if they didn't deserve it and as
if they need to be
that they need to be more
sharing and and and give away their
money and give more to the i just i
reject all those ideas
i think if someone wants to give they
can give and if they don't that's their
business and no one has any right to ask
someone to give money to anybody else i
think that's all political
and
uh it leads to a degraded society to to
accept to to demand
that someone give something to another i
i just totally reject all those things
um i don't think charity is a
responsibility i i don't i don't believe
that to be the case i believe that
charity is an option
and you are not and you are neither bad
for not doing it nor are you good for
doing it all things at the end of the
day are done for yourself if giving
charity made you feel bad nobody would
do it
as for
wealth and money itself i think
financial freedom is a big deal and i'll
also say that the only person who
actually
can search for truth is the one who is
financially free
the one who has to feed his stomach
cannot spend his life feeding his song
so if somebody's deadly serious to use
your words about that pursuit of mastery
but they haven't achieved the neural
terminology or definition that financial
freedom what do you tell them
i think that's too hypothetical of a
question i don't
i think that generally people who are
not financially free
are working
towards making more money i think that's
where
their
their priority is
um as opposed to
i want to search for truth often i can't
i can't say that categorically but
oftentimes it is
the case that
typically
someone who is trying to make money and
who isn't financially free
that'll be the great priority while they
have some desire for the truth that is
also an interest of theirs um
but it's very difficult to live in this
society without money
and i think everyone realizes that no
matter how much you want the truth at
the end of the day you must put the food
on the table
yeah amen to that all right two more
questions for you and i'll let you go
on your own path
to mastery
mastering your truth where are you
you know
that's a wonderful question i don't know
quite how
to answer it
all i can say is that
my
sincerity
and desire
to live a sweet spot of a life
is at a fever pitch
it is to the point of absolute
desperation
i do not want
a single moment of the day to go by
that i do not feel immersed
it is truly a desperation
i and i and i'll say that at the end of
the day
it is less about where someone is on a
ladder
and far more about how deep he is into
the wrong
and when you're
at that depth
that you are currently are how do you
feel inside
um
i think the answer is probably not
the one most will
imagine
that they'll hear
there's a lot of turmoil in seeking
truth
because
you want
everything
now
and
that
dogged
unrelenting
uncompromising
craving and quest
leaves one
always experimenting always exploring
always dissecting so it is a frenzy of a
life in many ways
um
[Music]
so
i would say some combination of of of
intensity
and immersion
your latest discourse is about answers
and you have two wonderful
young boys who are going to do great
things in the world
if you had a group of their best friends
or a group of 20 to 25 millennials that
you were mentoring
what would you make sure they learned
from you
you know i wouldn't make sure they
learned anything i would come on i would
just say that the the thing that they
would benefit the most from
in their own life
would be
to
allow
my dogged intensity
for the truth
to somehow
bleed into them
and
the dogged intensity
the
the uncompromising
immersion in whatever it is they want to
do
i think that is the thing that would
benefit them the most
by way of osmosis
much less than by way of instruction
well watching you doesn't hurt either
that's what
the watching i think is far more
impactful
than it is
well
this this certainly the 35 minutes or so
that we've just been together doesn't do
justice to the impact that you have on
everybody that you're around
i hope that you and i can build on this
conversation
and for those
listening to you for the first time what
is the best way for them to stay up to
date on what you do the great writing
that you do and uh you know i know
there's another book that's coming soon
so tell them how to find you
uh the website is this is part two of uh
my conversation with my friend kapil
gupta
uh you're about to be intrigued again so
my friend great to be with you
thank you mo likewise
so i want to start with something that
you said that for the past couple days
has had me really thinking and to you
it's going to be really simple to the
rest of us it's not
in order to become present
you must first become
absent
i think i have a sense of where you're
going but tutor me on that a little bit
presence is immersion into the moment
and in order to immerse yourself into
the moment you must disappear into the
moment as long as there is a you that
knows that you are in the moment you are
not of the moment
therefore in order to become
present
you must first become absent
how do you disappear tell me what you
mean by disappear so the great majority
of the day the great majority of us
we're disappeared right we don't even
know what we're thinking of what we're
doing we're just kind of going through
life but we're not present
yet presence is really
the way that it's
described
in the culture of society is
is a prescriptive sort of presence that
you should do x and y to become more
present yeah be in the moment and
be in the moment and even professional
athletes are told that by sports
psychologists all the time not being in
the moment now
um
how many years did it take buddha to get
into the moment and
that too after having surrendered his
his
crown and his
kingly robes
uh and disappear into the forest and
live the life of an ascetic
and
drink his own urine and live on a grain
of rice per day
and after years of that he found
presents
and yet
society and
modern day coaches and instructors
tell people to be present
as if they're asking them to tie their
shoe it's quite ridiculous
um
nothing if you're if you're serious
you're serious but don't don't talk
nonsense and tell someone to be present
the moment is something that one can
immerse themselves into a lifetime in
order to accomplish
um it isn't it isn't a prescription to
go present
one becomes present when he removes all
the things that are the impediment to
becoming present
the
most
obvious one
and the largest obstacle being
yourself
but the attempt to be present
while you are present
is
an ineffective prescription
if you truly want to seek the moment the
moment must mean more to you
than everything else
there can be no experiencer
it can only be the experience
so i'm going to be very cautious of my
words because for those who
listened to our last episode we talked a
lot about
why
the how is it where everything lies
so i'm going to ask you
what approach
if you've got people who are deadly
serious about
living
present in
the way you define it
what approach do we take to get closer
to that
the presence cannot be walked towards it
has to be backed into
when all of the interferences that are
your involuntary thoughts and your
worries
and your concerns
and your stresses and your anxieties and
your fears
when those things don't mean as much to
you
as it does to be present
you begin to naturally gravitate towards
the present moment
when you are using the present moment
and the idea of becoming present
as
a
prescription or as a treatment or as a
way to feel less stressed
it doesn't happen
because the impetus
for it
isn't sufficiently strong
these are very other worldly things that
are treated as if they're
apples in a basket
these are life devotional things
these are
true nectars of human existence
and to treat them
as if they were
to go blow your nose or to
put on some makeup
is is really
silly and it is fundamentally to not
understand
how deep
and how subtle
is the journey to reach these places
so all things happen by way of sincerity
all things happen by way of genuineness
they don't happen by way of technique or
prescription
and if you try to make them happen by
technique or prescription
you will leave
with the technique and the prescription
you will never leave with the thing
so do you ever worry
do i ever worry
i worry when i allow myself
to
play the game of the mind
and when you sense that what do you do
if i feel like playing the game
i play
if i don't feel like playing the game
i exit the game
why would you ever feel like i mean is
the mind taking you places where you
want to go right you're telling me that
yeah mine is a source of all it's a
wonderful question
yep that's a wonderful question
and that is because after you live life
for a number of years in a certain way
you become habituated to the various
games that you've been playing for many
years
and those habituations
have their sort of bells and whistles
attached to them
and because you are used to
at least for a number of years earlier
in your life being attracted by the
bells and whistles
the
the vestiges
and the residue
of those attractions still remain
as a result the attraction to sometimes
playing the game does remain
and for those reasons i sometimes play
that isn't the important thing
the important thing is
that i have a door through which i can
exit
how do you exit
when you're ready
i exit
when
my desire to exit is greater than my
desire to play
so and i want to play on that for a
minute i want to talk about
the truth this is probably the one area
that i have gotten more feedback than
anything from our initial conversation
there's so many people that talk about
the truth and transparency and all of
the buzzwords of modern society
but when you talk to someone about the
truth and when they listen to you speak
about it
to the great majority of people
that translates to them that hey i have
to be honest with myself i have to stop
lying to myself
but for you that's very shallow
in your world the real truth is much
deeper
take me there
the truth is the causality
the truth is the nucleus of the cell
the truth is the central source and
impetus
from which all
the problems at hand
were born
that is the truth
my truth i don't mean that someone's
lying or being
you know being
untruthful
the same way that by the word sincere i
don't mean that someone is being
deceitful
sincere means genuine
at least the way that i'm using it
the truth means what is the source of
the problem
and upon
examining the source
if you remove
that
central
element upon which the problem rests
then the problem will come tumbling down
every problem every situation every
circumstance has a truth
we may not know what it is
and usually we don't know what it is
but the just the idea
that the situation that i'm facing right
now
has an absolute definable and knowable
truth
and upon finding that
i will find my way
just that idea
allows one
to have a very effective alternative
to the
ineffective path
of
pursuing prescriptions
so can we demonstrate that for a little
bit can you demonstrate that with me or
could you share with us
an example that you have recently
discovered with somebody that you work
with who
did not know their truth but they were
dealing with a particular issue and by
walking them through that path of the
truth
you discovered it could you kind of
help us kind of peel the onion a little
bit with it
how about i give you
a chapter for my upcoming book
i would love that
um
imagine a human being that becomes
insulted when he is called
he or she is called
stupid
okay okay
someone calls them stupid they get
insulted they get angry
the natural reaction to that is to say
well i shouldn't get angry
or someone else their friend or some
therapist will tell them that
just because someone called you stupid
you the classic thing is this it doesn't
matter what someone says to you it's how
you react or don't take it personally
right
yes yeah that's all just nonsense okay
it doesn't matter how you react because
if you change how you react but you feel
a certain way that means you just change
the cosmetic of your reaction doesn't
affect how you feel you just kind of bit
your tongue so to speak so that's just
swirling muddy water on the operation
that doesn't get the truth of anything
that's just cosmetics
so
let's examine the truth about that
the truth that has nothing to do with
how you should behave if someone calls
you stupid
it has to do with
here's the question
if someone calls
this person stupid and the person gets
angry
the question is
why did they become angry
naturally
if we get the cosmetics out of the way
because the first five edges that you
get are always wrong because they're top
of the head and they're
uh
superficial
you know one of the first answers will
be one of the reasons i got and the
reason i got angry was because
i was called stupid well
no it's not true
because if that person called you
a cloud would you get angry
no
why not the reason that you wouldn't get
angry someone called you a cloud was
because you knew
in very
certain terms that you weren't a clown
if they if they called you a bird
you know
that you're not a bird so you wouldn't
get angry
then why are you getting angry when they
call you stupid
the reason that you that the person
would get angry if someone called them
stupid the reason that anger arose but
how to deal with the anger now what's
the best way to manage it all this silly
nonsense
what is the reason that the anger arose
the reason that the anger arose
is because when the person was called
stupid
something inside that person
seriously entertained the possibility
that they were in fact stupid sure
when that possibility was entertained
then another part of them the egoic part
of them
did not like the fact
that a part of them entertained
the idea that they were stupid
that produces internal conflict
that internal conflict
outwardly manifested itself as anger
now we have
the system the systematology and the
pathophysiology
of why the anger arose
when someone sees that
then they are able to truly dissect the
nucleus of the issue which in this case
would be
why is it that a part of me
seriously entertained the possibility of
me being stupid
that becomes the focus
and the focus does not become the
silliness about how i should react next
time
and when you discover that
and maybe you discover the fact that you
know the part of you that triggered that
goes back to
you know a childhood memory of a teacher
who's telling you you're not smart
enough you're never going to amount to
anything
what are you doing to try to put that to
closure
you don't have to do anything
it's just
exactly awareness is the cure
all doings
are done
when someone does not have an awareness
of the truth
then you need to
lower yourself
and resort to
doing
so kapio when you start to see the world
from that lens
how does a view change
it changes everything it's a complete
game changer because now all of your
focus and all of your attention
is on a completely different realm
on a completely different depth
therefore you begin to approach
everything that way
and by doing so
you begin to have insight that nobody
else has
but because you're smarter
because
the
number of people
in your domain or in any other domain
who are truly genuinely sincerely
willing to die for the truth
can be counted on one hand
it's pretty obvious right and and i know
you fit into that category but
that leads me i want to skip around a
little bit because that leads me to an
area the the the other area that was
another one of our themes that we talked
about last time that people are very
intrigued by which is this whole idea of
being empty professionally
there are far too many people in the
world who are empty professionally for
whatever reason right we see the
statistics the gallup studies and you
know all the misery that people have at
work
when you hear people talk about how
professionally
bankrupt they are
you get surface answers like i'm not
challenged enough i don't like my boss
burnout etc etc
what is the real reason that we put up
with these types of less than
satisfactory careers
because
something within us
is acceptable to us that we're there
fear if
if any well no i even if it was fear
the comfortableness of being there
is
something that means more to us than the
uncomfortableness
of leaving
so all decisions are already made it is
a very disingenuous thing when someone
asks you what should i do
they've already decided they're just
asking you for
they're just asking you in order to
hope that you give them the answer that
they've already decided upon validation
yeah absolutely okay
so the idea first of all of a job
i reject
i don't think anybody should have a job
i don't think anybody should have a boss
any human being
who lives under
the weight and the thumb
of somebody else is a prisoner
but that human being already has a
tyrannical warden call his mind
he doesn't need two of them
so
when someone says well i don't have a
job but if i don't put food in the table
i'm not gonna
you know i can't feed my fam you know
it's better to live destitute the street
i really mean it i really you just said
there's well
you just tweeted something do whatever
you have to do i mean it doesn't mean
just leave your job today but and i'm
not and i'm not asking people to leave
their job because if they want to they
will
um
but i think it's i think it's beneath
human beings
to have a job
if someone is completely well if someone
is completely immersed in what they do
it gives them glorious satisfaction
but i don't call that a job
even if you do happen to work for
somebody if what you do
makes you jump out of bed
it consumes all your faculties
it allows you to be completely immersed
in it
that it doesn't matter if you're working
for yourself or somebody else
that kind of experience is what everyone
craves
it just so happens that very few people
have that experience
even if they're self-employed
so sometimes you're a much worse boss
than the boss that you had before so
um it it isn't
being professionally bankrupt and being
professionally empty
has more to do with
what experience
that you not desire but insist upon
living within
then it does
that it has to do
with making your
job more interesting
that's more cosmesis
what's the percentage of people that you
meet that are totally immersed in what
they do
and is it skewed for you because you're
dealing with entertainers and
professional athletes and the people at
the top of their game is that a trick
question then yeah but even but but even
no but even they
they are influenced by the culture as
well
and
so
they
the level of immersion that i talk about
absolutely they experience and
many people experience it's just that
they only experience it occasionally and
the reason that they only experience it
occasionally
is because
that isn't at the forefront of their
priority and it and i'm not saying it
should be
there's no should
but
it just so happens that
that is exactly what they're seeking
without realizing that they receive
without realigning me or seeking it
kapil what do you tell somebody
who's
doing very well financially
in a job but really dislikes it
is that telling you that well
no no no it isn't for me to tell them
anything if someone's priority is money
their priority is money there's no good
and bad
there's no there's no morality
there's no right and wrong there's no
correct or incorrect if listen
lo if someone wants to be a billionaire
just to be a billionaire that isn't
right and that isn't wrong
it's just what the person wants
i i see that i see that but
at the price of
complete unsatisfaction and well-being
is it worth it
it depends who's asking the question
if
if
society is asking the question
then it's none of their business
if the person
who wants to become the billionaire
and or who becomes a billionaire
if he said
that it's not worth it
that i'm caught in this
sort of game and i feel trapped and i
desperately want a way out well that's
totally different
if he's the one thing
then
then that can be explored
and freedom can be had but
but it is very
it is society's natural default and
natural reflexive
dent
towards
recommending what they think is right
there's too much right and wrong
and
um
self-righteous morality
which flows through the air of society
that's what i appreciate so much about
you is
everything's personal
right that they're really these
universal beliefs and laws and you know
cliches and metaphors that we hear
while
the great overwhelming majority of us
internalize them you really take a step
back and
it's personal to the individual which is
something that's really refreshing
well
it's different
well well not only that it's i'll say
this
it doesn't work the other way
you could you you can impose all of your
morality on any if you like
he's not going to do anything
people don't respond to right and wrong
people don't respond to good and bad
do you know why
the people who don't commit crimes don't
commit crimes
it isn't necessarily because they think
it's wrong
they don't want to go to jail
so there's a practicality behind it it
isn't that they stay up at night
thinking about what the right thing and
the wrong thing is and if they do
that's a learned behavior
it's a societal religious
imposition
so so
it doesn't work
the only way it works is if it's
personal
and not only that
when it's personal
it has to be deeply personal
so it's like you have a choice
it isn't like
uh you you are able to impress your
morality upon people and when no one's
looking they're gonna obey
no they're not you know
this this really kind of triggers
something for me with and it's been
several months now since since our
relationship started and one of the
things i observe in you is you're
constantly
transcending you're constantly
you know you're you're just you're
you're seeking your own truth and i have
to believe that most people who would
give the time to listen to this and and
communicate with us as they have
they're very interested in
evolving i don't even want to use the
word changing evolving and trying to
experience this true transcendence
how do you
and the masters and the people you study
the people you work with
what do you do to continually transcend
the way you do
well you know situations continually
arise and then there are always
the situations that are ongoing for
which the precise truth has not yet been
discovered so
it really is a
chronic persistence
after
sort of the the great truths of life
um as opposed to finding ways to to to
transcend
so like give me an example of
one or two great truths that you've
discovered about your own life
that
the things
that the mind tell me are correct
are almost never correct
so
i stopped listening to the mind
but it never i have learned
well so what i mean the doc never
stopped sparking either it'll be like oh
listen to a dog um so
i've learned
to
not a hundred percent but a pretty good
percent i'm still working on the hundred
um i've learned to not allow the mind a
say
if i decide to do something i decide
the mind isn't going to vote
if i decide not to do it i'm not good
for not doing it or am i bad for not
doing it
and even if i do something that the mind
agreed with
it still doesn't get a vote
because it's wrong
the mind
the mind always lie
so it's less about being wrong because
not really you're wrong and right but
always lies
but you just a reactive liar that's
probably a truth that we all share
oh sure
oh sure
there's nothing that's unique to me
we all suffer the same problems
so for the majority of us you say you're
not not a hundred percent but you're
you're on your way to a hundred percent
for the majority of us
with this whole mind thing
how do we even start to get to the 10 or
20 how do we start to start to
conceptualize the mind in within the
same context as you just said hey the
dog never barks i've never heard that
never stops barking
how do we start to let go of some of
that stuff and start
realizing ourselves
that hey a lot of that crap upstairs is
crap
sincerity understanding and
experimentation
sincerity
in
really wanting to learn about the mind
and not about psychology
because
the mind has psychology for breakfast
psychology doesn't touch the mind
it's just
behavior modifications
and swirling of the muddy water
so sincerity in wanting to learn about
the true nature of mind
its habits its patterns
like watching an animal in the wild
and the second thing i always forget
what i say so what was the second thing
i said
sincerity what ex
i don't i said three things i know that
much
well you said sincerity for sure right
and experiment and then i said
yeah transmutation was one of them
um
after
one is
if one is sincere
then
they will experiment with their own mind
to discover the thoughts that it creates
how often is it right
not what it should say not what it
shouldn't say not that you're going to
get mad at for saying it wrong
not that you're going to be happy with
it for saying it right
just
as an impartial observer
the things that it says to do or that it
has fed to do
in past situations
whether it be in relationships or
one's work or
in a decision making capacity whatever
it is
how often is it right
how often has it genuinely helped the
individual and how often has it
genuinely hurt the individual
and i'm not leading anyone to be to be
totally
upfront about it and examine it as a
neutral observer
through that
sincere exploration
one then develops the capacity
for
in order to cultivate abilities
that he did not previously have
they were always latent within him
but before
he was functioning by way of societal
conditioning
things relating to psychology and do
this don't do that and
the mind is a
a great thing that is your friend and it
can move mountains and
all of which are only half truths the
mind absolutely can move mountains
but it can only move mountains once you
are no longer under its control
is
do you devote your learning because
you're always writing you're always
studying
what are you learning
is it is
your learning path geared towards
the discovery of some of these things
that you've shared with us
i want to be the master
of my mind
it should never even get a bleep
it should never even get a whisper
my mind needs to become my genie in a
bottle
i want to be
i want to be completely
100 percent
a master of life
to understand
how everything works
to untangle
the ball of yarn
to know it
intimately
why is it a curiosity absolutely not
it's life and death for me because
this is what drives me when i have
everything untangled
i am free
everything comes under my control
when i know something that deeply
when i know
when i see
the strings behind the stage when i
solve this rubik's cube
nothing can affect me anymore
i am no longer a prisoner to anything
that
to me
is a life
well spent
so when you're around people and i want
to get to some of the questions and some
of the most intriguing ones that uh
that people have communicated with me
specifically from our last conversation
and one of the ones that i found
interesting was this whole idea of about
doubt and positive self-talk
first what do you think ignites doubt in
people
fear
of what's to come
of not getting what they want to get
but how do i know that until i try
well you will try
but you'll be fearful as you try
you see that's not a good reason desire
well
well you act like
you function out of choice
you function of compulsion
fear and desire go hand in hand
whenever the mind desires something
it fears not getting it ten times as
much
that causes self-doubt
how do you handle that
it isn't about handling anything
it's about learning by
i wrote about this in the discourse a
few times years ago my
younger son was
seven or eight
and we were on the golf course
you know training
and he asked me a question
and i'll never forget where i was
standing when he asked me and he said
where does
here come from daddy
and my mind said to me at that moment it
said well here you go you're on the spot
you know what are you going to do now
mind master
right
you you don't have to you have to give
him response right now he's looking
right into your eye
and i didn't allow myself to think
because i knew that if i thought
i would spend my wheels so i allowed
instinct to answer the question
and this is what instinct said
instinct said
that wherever there is a consequence
there is fear
so it is the un it is the understanding
of that
that allows one to proceed with wisdom
it is not the dealing with anything
it isn't the management of anything
i think dealing with and management
should be thrown into the trash can and
anyone who ever has a stress management
conference should be fired
and put in jail i think all management
and all dealing with
is all
cosmetic
20-minute too late
prescription
nonsense
all treatments
are nonsense
either there is a cure
that you have
or shut your mouth
because
a genuine human being
deserves nothing less
so i appreciate the instinctive decision
that you gave your son back then
so does that mean
is is the answer to learn how to detach
from outcomes to learn how to detach
from these no that's two prescriptions
that's that's back to perspective again
it is
the reason that you asked me what do you
do
is because you haven't explored it okay
listen
moe
if you were sitting in a chair
and there is a snake
under your chair
the only knowledge that you need
the only information
that you need
is for me to tell you
if there's a snake under your chair
damn right after after having obtained
that information
one person might
sit perfectly still
one person might
jump off the chair and
run down the hall
one person who has experience with
snakes might reach down and grab the
head of the stake
one person might
pull out a knife from his pocket and
cut the stake in half
what the person does is irrelevant
it is simply
that he must be armed with the knowledge
and the insight
that there is a snake under the chair
no one needs two pieces of information
the information of the snake and what do
i do they only need the first piece of
information
what then is confidence how do you
define confidence
well it isn't about definition
um is it a feeling
confidence
comes
from systems
if you
are
performing a task
in order to have confidence in that task
you have to have a system
that performs the task for you and you
execute that system
every time
even if that system doesn't always
produce
the desire that you the the outcome that
you want
100 of the time
then
you go back and you refine the system
but confidence is more about
surrendering yourself to a system
than it is about
you trying to produce a certain inc
outcome because if you if each time you
don't rely upon a system and you
yourself
try to produce a certain outcome
sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't
most times it doesn't as a result
you will lose confidence in yourself
because it is yourself that is doing the
action
but if you create a system
then the system does the action
and you have confidence in it
a person has confidence when he rides in
a boat that the river will take him down
itself
he will not have to
paddle necessarily a flowing river will
take him downstream
he has confidence in the river
if the river was completely still
and he jumped into
the river
and it was up to him to make every
paddle and splash
then sometimes he may get down the river
other times he may get tired it would be
very ineffective and spotty
therefore he would lose confidence in
the fact that he's able to consistently
make himself go down the river
so i believe that in whatever task it is
whether it's professional sports
or whether it's business whatever it is
to create a system
that can be relied upon
and each time you execute that system
you test its efficacy
when after having received the data
as to how efficient that system is you
go back and refine refine refine until
the system produces
the outcome that you desire most if not
all of the time and then that is the
thing that you have confidence in
to rely
totally upon ourselves
is a very ineffective
way to go about things
so now you're opening up oh
the window's opening a little bit for me
you're not a golfer sure but you coach
pga players
you're not a swimmer
but olympic swimmers seek you out
you certainly have never been in
entertainment
still
the a-list people have you on direct
dial
so if it's not skills that you're
teaching
is it this system that you're helping
them design
well
there's some there's a great truth
that is operative
that everyone must understand
and it applies to everything
the thing
is never about the thing
it's about the mind whatever
basically it's about the mind yes
it's never about the action
it's about the source of the action
it's never about
the
the carrying out of the action
it's about the intention of the action
it's always about
the deep seated impetus
behind the thing that's where all the
magic is
it's never in the execution of the thing
the execution is a natural byproduct
of the impetus
so is that no one
no singer loses their voice no
no pga tour player
loses their swing
and yet
and that is the truth
but
they tend to lose their swing all the
time
and they
call in their instructors from all over
the country to come see them to ask them
why their swing plane is too inside or
outside or
over the top or across the line and all
this just just garbage
that is because they believe that they
are the executors of the action
and if you yourself of the executor of
the action
you will be inefficient far more than
you will be efficient as a result you
will lose confidence you will then
believe
that you will need to refine your
technique
in order to perform the action better
thereby getting more confidence so that
you can have better execution
that doesn't work
so everything
another theme
everything in society
and i'm talking at the highest levels of
society
the pga tour the nba
world-class performing artists
high level acting
the hollywood stage everything
is backwards
where do we start as individuals who are
committed to this
depends where you want to go
i want to go to the truth
i want to go i want to go be the master
of my mind
like the quest that you are in the
process of conquering
and i speak for a lot of people who've
commented on this
then if that is
genuinely and sincerely your quest
then you will begin to walk down that
path
and if you do not walk down that path
there should be no remorse for not
having walk down it it is just that
you will then know
that that as of yet
at least
is not your sincere desire because if it
works then you would have already walked
yeah well a lot of us have something we
never we never do
what we don't want to do
that is another myth
we never do what we don't want to do
we always get what we want
we are not victims we are creators and
that is not a motivational phrase
it is
it is said in order to provide insight
that all of our actions
are motivated by our own intrinsic
inspirations and motivations regardless
of what we tell ourselves
do you believe in positive self-talk
no i think it's all garbage
so that's part of that mind speaking to
you that you ignore that's the dog
barking
well actually positive self-talk is
you tell yourself that you're great
and
you can tell yourself that you're great
but
what's your mind gonna say back
and when your mind speaks back and tells
you that that's right and who
whose voice do you think wins
this is all
i gotta tell you the fact that the fact
that i have to say these things and you
know what i say this these kind of
things that come up in all kind of
podcasts and interviews and talks and
head with people
i am actually flabbergasted
that knowing that this is actually a
discussion i am i am shocked that we are
at this stage
of
of evolution in society
where self-talk
is actually considered to be an
effective thing
hey there are books on that they're
people who charge lots of money to have
you to go to a seminar for three days so
you can walk out with your rituals to to
have yourself talk when you wake up and
when you go to sleep yeah right after
that right after the mindfulness seminar
and the stress management stress
management of course man that's you paid
a lot of money for that one
yeah
yeah and i'm sure that you went once and
you were cured well exactly absolutely
listen i i
this is the to me these are the most
fascinating conversations i have ever
had and i am completely indebted to you
for having them and i hope we can keep
building on them i have to ask you one
last question and we'll put a pause for
this one and hopefully build on it
if you were running
a
company that is growing really fast
like one of these technology companies
and you are the leader or ceo whatever
of this company
what would your leadership style be what
would your people expect from you
what's
what's my vision for the company
[Music]
to build the company and then look for
an exit
or is this something that i
want to
nurture and create into a
google or an apple the latter
what
what do you want to hear
i want to hear how you'd lead a company
like that
all things at the end of the day come
down to leading yourself with perfection
when you
operate from a place of
sincere motivation
and all and your eyes are forever on
yourself
looking at all the holes in yourself
it has an effect on people and whether
it does or not it doesn't matter it
wouldn't matter to me
because i wouldn't
change it even if it didn't
but
just from experience it tends to have a
ripple effect on people
that
compels them to walk
along those lines
without you ever having to ask them to
do so
it becomes infectious and contagious
not your behavior
not your motivational speeches
but who you are
creates what the company becomes
and
would one of your priorities
in addition to yourself
wanting to transfer that to the people
that you have because you can't build
that type you can't build apple
by yourself you're going to have people
all over the world but you're you're the
the prophet you're the leader
well
each all people that i would hire would
be
enormously skilled in their particular
domain
so the things that i'm discussing aren't
aren't skill developments they already
have that the things that i'm discussing
are
uh inspiration and
purity of intent
um
it wouldn't be about me instilling
anything into them it would be about
me
examining my motivations for doing all
the things that i do
in each interaction with a person in in
in just the way that i walk into the
office
whatever i do
that would create
uh that would set the tone
now
if there were people who did not
uh
exemplify
that pursuit towards perfection in
themselves
as it relates to their role in the
company
then they wouldn't be part of the
company anymore
so i would recruit
and i would surround myself
with the people
whose sensibilities
were
naturally in line with
a pursuit toward making something great
i'm not much of a believer in pep talks
that's obvious i believe
i believe you are the walking
example
the becoming is the message
talk is cheap
well hey
if nothing else
the last 45 minutes
uh and for those who
have been with us
they've certainly
maybe taken one kind of slight step
towards that becoming and i want to put
a pause here because i know we're going
to build on this but let people know
tell me about your upcoming book where
do people find you how do they keep up
to date with you
twitter's where
i spend some of my time it is at
g u k-a-p-i-l-g-u-p t a m d
website is kapilguptamd.com
uh
the upcoming book
is sort of under wraps right now
although i did reveal the chapter today
for the first time
the discourses are many books in and of
itself
yeah the disc courses i suppose so it's
always a pleasure for me to get kapil on
our program
because not only does his work and his
thinking fascinate me but i think more
importantly
he's probably one of the very few
individuals who just gets to the heart
of the matter regardless of what we talk
about
so uh kapil i know there's a new book
out but more importantly it's always a
pleasure to talk with you about whatever
we want to talk about
thank you mo likewise so
i kind of shared with you what i what i
would like to do is kind of i've
selected four or five questions
that i consistently get from people who
i recommend your work to so i want to
kind of let that guide our conversation
but before we do that what fascinates me
about you more than anything is about
your amazing immersion
to continually get better yourself
so tell me something new that you've
recently learned
that you didn't know before
i think it relates to
the nature of who we believe ourselves
to be
beyond simply the
idea of
disenfranchising
the ego
but more fundamentally
the concept of
frankly the concept of self-concept
and the concept of self-image
um it seems to govern our entire lives
and i think that the fundamental
realization
of who one really is and more
importantly who one
and what one is not
i think is truly
at the foundation
of
living a
true life
as opposed to
struggling through life
so is it any surprise that that's
the dialogue that you share in the
opening chapter of your new book
which
you know this question compel of who am
i
kind of seems to govern this whole shift
of mindfulness this whole shift of
spiritual thinking and certainly i know
that
that's part of the the deep thinking
that you do about yourself but i know
that you look at it from a different
context
how do we begin to answer that question
it relates to
the things that one can no longer accept
as
all right
there has to be a level of desperation
or unbearability so to speak
uh with regard to where one is
that really is the only impetus uh to to
change direction in whatever facet of
what whatever facet of life one explores
once something is no longer okay
then um a path
away from that is is sought
so it really comes down to
um
where someone is with regard to
uh
one's level of desperation of no longer
wanting to experience the things
that he or she experiences or the
opposite which is
uh
no longer being able to be kept from the
things that he or she wants to
uh have or attain
so is there really an answer to it like
in your own journey
have you answered that question for
yourself or
is it that constant quest
you know i i don't really believe in
constant quests because
that very quickly turns into
a procrastination
and that's exactly
the fundament of human beings is to
procrastinate about everything
and so when someone says that i'm going
to be a perpetual student and always
continue to learn
and it's a constant quest and it's a
journey that has no end
that there is way too much license there
to never arrive anywhere which is
precisely
what the mind happens to want
um because at the end of the day a human
being is a prisoner to his mind
and the ultimate freedom is freedom from
the mind and freedom from the self so
so it can't be a constant quest there
has to be an end point and the end point
is the very inspiration the very
motivation
that gets one moving in the first place
what's yours
total freedom
and and so from
when did you know you got there
because
and it's wonderful i haven't gotten
there i haven't gotten there um
this is this is still a quest but it by
no means is a
is an infinite quest um there there very
definitely better be an end point
because uh it simply isn't okay um
with me
uh to
to live in any
imprisoned sort of way to
the the nuances and behaviors and
machinations on the mind that simply
isn't okay so so no i haven't gotten
there it's something that i'm it's
something that is at the center
of my life it's it's my devotion
well and i know that
one of the approaches for all of us to
take
is to start subtracting everything that
isn't supposed to be there
um
from yes yes or no yes and no um
what you have just said is a true
statement
um the truth comes about
largely through subtraction not through
addition that is a true statement
however
the stating it in such a way you smoke
it too easily mo
you said it too easily
and and when you say when you when you
say it too easily
it immediately will be imbibed as a
prescription um so then the people will
be told to
watch your thoughts
and keep subtracting and keep saying i'm
not that i'm not that
and nettie nettie you know and there the
whole gang of gurus and the
spiritualists come calling you know if
you can't you can't say it that easily
because you have to be fully cognizant
of the fact that the people who are
listening to you are not the people
themselves but it is their minds who are
listening to you
and when the mind listens to that that
all you have to do is subtract keep
subtracting um it will then tell
its possessor
that
uh or possess e
that
you see you see this is what you must do
so go over in the corner and begin to
subtract
and that will be its own prison this is
why no one ever gets anywhere
so i i understand
the spirit of what you said
but
there must be extreme care
in the way that we speak
because we know that the mind is lurking
behind every corner
so i'm going to come back to that in a
second but let me dive into this first
question because you brought it up
almost invariably when i recommend your
work and when i say your work your books
your discourses your podcasts all the
things that really kind of capture some
of the essence of your thinking the
first question that i get
is
i i i think i get what he's talking
about but what does he really mean when
he talks about no prescriptions
what do you really mean
okay that's a good question
um first it has to be recognized that
if you follow
the
idea of no prescriptions
and
you say to yourself
that i cannot follow a prescription
that i can't follow because it's a
prescription that i can't follow because
it's a prescription
then that in itself becomes a
prescription
so it isn't about adopting the idea of
no prescriptions
then that becomes no
better than anything else
it really it comes down to understanding
so it isn't it doesn't mean on some
pulpit and you sitting below me and me
teaching and preaching to you we are
sitting on the same side of the desk
and we are conversing together
so
the reason that prescriptions
get people into trouble
is because
a prescription serves only its own end
nobody can be prescribed his way to
success
nobody can be prescribed all the way to
enlightenment
if they could if once again please don't
believe me look at the evidence
if one could
then
the buddha's writings have been around
for hundreds and hundreds of years
uh who has gotten enlightened by reading
any of the four noble truths
and there are zen temples and buddhist
temples all around the world
um how many do you see or have heard of
getting enlightened by visiting a zen
temple or a buddhist monastery or
sitting and doing meditation for six
hours a day so if that were true
then you could very easily be prescribed
to enlightenment because the
prescriptions all exist
in space same thing with same thing with
success
if someone becomes a super successful
ceo or investor
or an artist or a singer or a
professional athlete or whatever
if if that could be bottled
then they would just say well just do
this and do this and do this
and you'll become as great as i am well
that's been they tried to it's been
that's right they've been trying again
and again and again well how many
michael jordans do you see walking
around how many tigers do you see
walking around
right so if that were true
then that would be very easy to
replicate but it isn't true that's why
it isn't there
so
we have to look at the evidence and then
and there's the evidence for the fact
that
when you are told that this is what you
must do
then what will happen is that your mind
will focus on the this
it will focus upon
the position of your left arm and how
good your lotus position is right and
how straight your back is and how many
times you said the mantra right and how
much incest that did you actually burn
and how many hours did you sit for
and
that becomes a new goal
the prescription itself replaces the
original goal
and now you become subservient
to
doing the prescription
and making that perfect
as opposed to
reaching somewhere
so whenever you give someone a how to
get there they will forever get to the
how but they will never get to the air
and our entire society is based upon
this is the five step plan these are the
three next steps these are the ten ways
to become happy
all these things
they not only not only do they not work
they can't work
because no one can be prescribed his way
to anything
so how do how do
we start to get there if you had me and
10 others who said hey
i don't need to
tell you how much i appreciate what you
do and your level of thinking but if you
get a group of us in a room to say hey
we want to learn from you we want to get
in this pursuit where we can be the
absolute best versions of ourselves what
are we going to be working on
you're not going to work on anything
it
first and foremost
is is this take this example
if i drop you into a lake and you can't
swim
you are not going to ask me how to flail
your arms
somehow in some way
until your arms tire out and you don't
have a single drop of energy left in
your body
you will do anything and everything
necessary to get yourself to shore
you're damn right and the re and the
reason that you will is not because you
took flailing classes
before you went to the lake
the reason that you will
is is because
the the key ingredient
of the desperation to get to the shore
was there
the destination the desire the
desperation
creates the how
it is not the other way around
so if that's the case
i mean
there has to be
i have to believe that the great
majority of the world
may be
they're not in that desperation mode but
if i go out and ask 10 very successful
people and however they define success
is this all there is for you i would bet
you that all 10 would say no there is a
next stage
is that the desperation that we're
looking for or how do you define that
everyone is desperate for something
exactly but very few people ever reach
that level that you're talking about if
any
i think
i don't
i think the ones who are sufficiently
desperate always reach
either by
a serendipitous encounter with someone
either by happening to be in the right
place at the right time
either by
some idea that comes into them from a
place
unknown
whatever
whenever someone has a sufficient
sufficient level of desire
or desperation
they don't not reach it
you see i don't believe in failure
i i fully expect people to fall
along the way
because everything is experimentation
until you succeed
but ultimate failure
ultimate failure
is only for those who are not desperate
enough i just don't buy the idea that i
give an individual
was desperate enough and didn't get
there
i think that the universe is created in
such a way
that when there is a requisite level of
deposit of desperation
that
things begin to happen
that cannot be explained
that aid him in that process
so i want you to give our listeners i'm
assuming here the people who are
listening to this know about what we do
and certainly know about your work
because
you know strategically
the message that you've been sharing
with people is something that i've been
promoting
since we met two years ago
give me an example of a before and after
of somebody that you worked with
who
started to get a glimpse of that
i i don't know where
where that really goes no i mean
um i just want people yeah i could i i
could give you i could give you i came i
could give you several examples but but
but it but it
you know
i can't provide an explanation as to how
those things happen
so it really becomes a fragment
fragmentary conversation because
um you know people have you know found
you know
an enormous sense of peace and
uh they begin their behavior begins to
drastically change and
they you know but
these things
i hesitate greatly in mentioning being
mention these things
because
i don't want to sound like a brochure
you know what i mean
because
i never tell anybody when i begin
working with them
this is this is what's this is what's
going to happen this is what i'm going
to promise you
i i'm
just as surprised as anybody else how
these things happen that they happen at
all all i know for one thing
which is the absolute
fact
is that
when there is an uncompromising
pursuit
and exploration
of the truth about a given issue
in a given person's life
there are fundamental
physiologic
universal biologic psychological
changes that begin
to happen
the
it's
it's
it's mystical almost i have no idea how
it happens
um
but something within the human organism
responds
to uncompromising and direct truth
perhaps because it is so foreign
in our world
to talk about anything that is direct
truth everything is superficial and
cosmetic and prescriptive
that
it is it is so
foreign
to delve into that
sort of rarified
um
arena
that maybe that's why things begin to
happen
but they just do and i can't predict
what's going to happen
but
that's what i've seen time and time
again so do you find that there's
something missing
in you know in that quest
because the next big question i get is
what exactly is this truth that he's
talking about
so
take you know
it's
it's crucial to begin with those things
that are most acute in someone's life
so
wherever
wherever one wants to go
um he or she can only go there from
where they currently are
so the most practical things that are
happening in one's life be it a you know
conflict with others or be it anxiety or
depression or
whatever it is
that's where we must begin
and so
the the exploration
is not about how do we lessen your
anxiety
the exploration is not about these are
the things that you can do to make
yourself feel better i have no interest
in making anybody feel better i couldn't
care less if you felt better
that is not what i'm here to do
because i know for a fact that whenever
you feel better
sooner or later you're going to feel
worse again that's all part of the same
game
that isn't a game i'm interested in
playing so the real the exploration of
the truth comes in
when you begin to dive deep into the
very source and the very root
the unimaginable root
of where those anxieties really come
from
without any expressed intent
of trying to lessen their anxiety
and that is fundamentally
wildly different
from
what anyone is used to that isn't the
world that we live in
can you give me example of somebody's
truth
that you worked with
you know for instance
you know this is an example i give in
the book and it's a common example that
happens with many many people and it's
um
if someone if someone is angry at you
and they
slander you
um the natural
human reaction is to get upset
and
then the natural prescription is
don't get upset
um it's not what they say it's how you
react it's not personal it's not about
you that's right
that's right take five deep breaths and
take you know this just dribble i mean
it's almost it's almost shameful that
people would you know say these things
okay
um
it really is you know the question isn't
well how do i not get upset that isn't
the question
the question is why did the upsetness
happen
why
from where did it arise
and where that arises from is that when
someone
is slandered
a part of them begins to entertain the
fact
that
they are in fact what the other person
called them
so someone calls someone an idiot
something inside the person begins to
entertain the fact seriously that maybe
you are an idiot
and yeah and
then and then
that creates
self-conflict
because the other part of that person
says well no i don't no i'm not
and how can you mean himself which is
really a conversation against the mind
it's mine talking to mind
um says well
well no i'm not and the other part of
the person says well maybe you are and
that creates internal conflict and then
that internal conflict
manifests itself as anger
now a in order to prove that
if someone calls you
uh
a
an yes
no same thing genius would cause
self-conflict too because the part of
you would say you're not genius
okay so
if someone calls if someone calls you an
elephant someone called you a horse
right that you're a horse
well you wouldn't really get angry
because there would be no part of you
that would seriously entertain that you
were a horse
and therefore there would be no
self-conflict and all conflict
is self-conflict
so that is a fundamentally different
approach
because it gets down to the truth it
gets down to the source of where the
upsetness so to speak arises
as opposed to
playing the superficial and cosmetic
game
which
essentially perpetuates the problem no
one ever gets over anything by you
saying it isn't about them it isn't
about you it's about them
uh don't take it personally no one ever
gets over
no one ever gets that doesn't cure
anybody
okay um so this does
okay a con a constant revisiting of the
source of one's problems
eventually begins to create an
understanding within a person
which begins to free him from the
problems he's imprisoned to
well if there's something that i have
imprinted uh
in my head from just all of the
conversations we had is something that
you said there is that all conflict is
self-conflict and i want to get to that
in a minute but something was triggered
in my mind
how come most of us
need the approval of other people
because we are not whole
and therefore
we look to
any and all arenas
in order to fill the holes within
ourselves
professional athletes they say all the
time
they need to win
winning just to win is one thing
but
no professional athlete wins just to win
everyone looks to the game
looks to the field looks to the court
in order to fill a hole within
themselves
and that is why the only one who can
really play
and the only one who can really live
is the one who arrives arrives home
when there is no need
there's freedom
is that part of the game
so the game doesn't become
how do i garner and accumulate enough
validation
in order to patch up these holes
the
the real pursuit becomes
how do i become a whole
so that i no longer need
to fill up any holes and
where do i start with that because one
of the things obviously the great
majority of your work starts and ends
with the mind right assuming that this
audience
understands that each of us at some
point or another maybe not all the time
but at some point or another
get in our own way of our own progress
why do we get stuck there why do we get
stuck with our minds
because we believe the mind to be
ourselves
that sounds so damn easy
um
you know everything is easy
it just depends upon
one's level
of desire
see there is no difficult the difficult
is
what is difficult the difficulty is
making yourself do something that you
don't really want to do
that's difficult
easy is the congruence
of what you're doing with what you
really want to do
so this is why everyone says this is
so hard and
well you know
of course it's hard because it's all
penance
everyone subscribes because you know
from religion to education to parents
society's all been taught society has
been teaching human beings for millennia
all
that you have to pay
that you have to
uh
you have to you have to give penance
that you must suffer
that you must work hard and bleed and
sweat in order to get somewhere
and
even if that were true
what has happened is
that man has fallen in love with the
sweat and the blood and the struggle
and he's forgotten all about
why he was struggling in the first place
well the struggle becomes the mantra of
our life
well the struggle becomes the goal and
that's exactly what we get back to your
earlier question about prescriptions
the prescription becomes a new goal that
becomes a new god
am i doing it correctly am i doing it
long enough how long must i do it before
it comes
what does it take to change course
desire
sincerity
seriousness
without trying to be
and what the hell does that look like
it looks like the things that you've
already attained in your life
and the reason that you have them is
because you couldn't live without them
and the reason that you couldn't live
without them
is because you have them
do you think people are afraid of
this wholeness and freedom that you're
talking about do you do you think that
the great majority of us
are
force ourselves to be happy with this
struggle that this is kind of the way
we're supposed to live you know you're
supposed to work really hard in the
world you're supposed nothing is easy
the path to the top this you know paved
with really hard work
is that just the world that we're
creating for ourselves or is it in our
heads
um it's conditioning
um
and
there's no opposing view to the
condition
so i don't know what it is that i do but
some it's interesting
some have mentioned to me
that what i provide for them and they're
in a much better position to judge what
i do than i am but um what it is i do
for them is give them an opposing view a
sort of sanctuary
uh which is the only place that
in their life they can go
that
is not full of the cultural conditioning
when you when you only hear one
loudspeaker
um
you you you can't really overcome that
when that's all you hear when that's in
the water
well that's the food
when that's in your ear when that's in
front of your eyes day and night
for decades upon decades how can any
reasonable human being be expected
to to say you know that's
everything is wrong
how can
you have to be almost insane
to
seriously entertain that prospect
that everything that you've heard
is false
it's all based upon prescriptions
and lore
and cultural conditioning
once again you don't
please don't believe anybody especially
not me look at the evidence
so if you just if all these things
worked go ahead have you just taken a
stand that
regardless of what it is you're going to
just question the oh i i haven't taken a
stand for me to take a stand would be
to to believe in what i believe i don't
believe in what i believe
i only believe in the evidence
i don't need to take a stand
you don't need to take a stand that the
moon arises in the sky not on the ground
you don't need to take a stand or you
can go outside and look
this is this is years of of observing
and seeing
and and witnessing the same patterns
again and again and again and i'm not
the only one
the people who the people who arrive at
the pinnacle of their craft in any field
in any field
they have an inkling of this too
because they tend not to do what others
do
they tend to be contrarian
they tend to be loners
they tend to be against the grain
they tend to be part of the fringe
element
that isn't by accident
you know the the common socializing
um groupie
is not the individual who becomes elite
he gets what everybody else gets
so this is this is in
to a to a small segment segment of the
population
this is not news
but if you walk into any discipline any
arena
and you know nothing about the arena
whether it's engineering or medicine or
sports
or business or finance whatever it is
you can walk into any arena knowing
nothing about it and saying
whatever are your prevailing dogmas and
i have no idea what they are they're
wrong
because the majority view is always
wrong
the majority opinion is always wrong
the people that you work with that get
this and the people that you work with
that
share with you that the great
contribution that you make is to be that
opposing view
what does that do to their thinking
you know you ask me too much about what
the the people on the receiving end
think
um i i have to
i don't know i
i don't know things just happen you know
i don't
i don't know i mean i i
hear them say things and do things but
you know
once again if i go into that it sounds
it sounds too
um
promotional you know what i mean uh and
and i don't want to promote really
anything
it's it just
happens well you're not promoting
anything because you're only going to
work with the people that you want to
work with anyway
right so it doesn't well interestingly
the people who are here the people who
end up coming people who end up coming
i mean everything seems to self-select
right i mean so when people go to the
website they read my discourses or they
or they you know subscribe to my private
discourses
when they read the books and they listen
to the podcast
it tends to self-select for a particular
sort of dna of individual
and it it sort of
it sort of
shuns a more
worldly common thinking individual um so
it very much self selects so it isn't
so the people who come tend to come
already
being relatively well vested
in in what um in being in alignment
with the things that um
that i subscribe to
uh by virtue of having you know read all
of these things before they came well
speaking of that your latest discourse
or maybe was a couple weeks ago
really
speaks to that and and it really spoke
to me because you've shared it in some
context here where you talk about this
whole idea of the superhuman
and that all of us
are created equal by way of flesh and
blood but it's the heart within us that
differs greatly
go into that a little bit if you
remember what the hell you wrote i have
no idea what discourse you're talking
about um um but the
i'm i'm the statement that you just
mentioned i'm hearing it for the first
time i might have written it i don't
remember
um but but it's true it's it's i guess i
must agree with myself
if i wrote that um
it
it really comes down to the dna of a
particular individual
um
you know
what i do in some ways is for everyone
and in some ways really isn't for
everyone and when what i mean by that is
um
fundamentally we are all human beings
and therefore
um these are all
uh
these are the truth about things
uh really arriving somewhere in one's
life is really what we all seek
but we have to first arrive at the place
in which we are desirous of arriving
there and so that is an evolutionary
process within ourselves and i don't
know why some people
truly are are ready for such things and
others
are not
um so in that sense it isn't for
everyone because
many are going to read these things and
be and consider it uh
extraordinarily almost mystical and
uh
you know 180 degrees opposite of
of of the world that they're used to
living in and therefore it's just too
much
so it really comes down to so yeah we
are all flesh and blood we are all
trying to go to the same place by
different names
um but it really comes down to the dna
of a particular individual
that determines
whether or not he is ready to
pursue
such a journey
but as the old saying goes
i assume you agree with the point of hey
if you find yourself at the side of the
majority if you find yourself following
the crowd you're probably heading the
wrong place true
yes
talk to me about how we deal with
attachment at some point we all face it
we all deal with it
we're all dealing with it right now
it's human yeah
i mean
that's i mean that's a wonderful
question and it really um
no you have really raised a
a fundamental seat
of
um
of
human misery
and
human strife i like that human human
misery i like that
uh absolutely um
you know the buddhists the buddhists say
um you know do not be attached and
the gurus say do not be attached and
uh
and
and all it's it's absolutely true
but
it's kind of like saying be present
or just be
and those are those are really more
cosmetic
you know
silly comments
um
it isn't about not being attached
because you can't not be something
because if you try to not be something
you will drift into prescription land
and you will get nowhere
it is about seeing the belly of the
beast
it is about seeing the eyes and the
teeth in the glare
you do not need to fix anything
you need to see
everything
so when one truly sees
only then does a journey towards
non-attachment even become possible
a person who was trying to become
unattached by prescriptive means
it is not possible for him to even enter
the journey
to becoming unattached
because he will never escape the vortex
of the prescription
it is not about what do i do
it is about seeing the devastation it is
about seeing the shrapnel
it is about seeing
the chaos
that ensues
on account of attachment
not listening to anybody
not hearing some book say that you
should not be attached
those things will not do anything for
you because we as human beings do not
act unless our backs are against a wall
and the only way that our backs become
against a wall
is if we truly see
knowledge is not powerful enough
to make one change
neither is the empty idea of health
health isn't enough
there has to be something in it for me
for the human
and that something better be deep
only then will he commit without trying
to commit
he will commit when he has no choice
not because good for him
well i bring that up because as we
at as we tape this
you know there's a an incredible
catastrophe going on here in southern
california that we're living through
right now you know people's homes are
devastated these fires are going crazy
uh lives you know every day that the
number of lives that are being lost is
going up and i was having a conversation
this morning with somebody who actually
lost their home here in malibu
and um
i was very impressed with
the
i don't want to say the lack of
attachment but
that it took a few days that but he came
to grips with the fact
that everything i had is gone
i'm not happy about it
but
at least i'm still here and i have the
capability to replace it
and when you talk about this issue with
a lot of people
um it's a tough one it's a really tough
one when they're going through what
they're going through
and that's why i wanted to get your
perspective on it what message would you
have
for
people that are going through that here
right now where one day you're sleeping
in your bed
and a couple of hours later everything
that you own is gone
there's no message i can give
there's no there's no
message i can give to suit someone or to
make them feel better or to make them
feel comfortable comforted
or
to make the pain any less there's
nothing i can say
but is there something that you can say
about this whole idea of attachment
would be
yeah
or maybe upset is not the right word
uh would we be as impacted
if we weren't as attached
well no but but that's
but the only reason that you're asking
that question is because
a person's house burned down
right exactly what i'm going to what i
what i what i want what i want to hear
you ask is
okay let's say no one's house burned
down
you wouldn't be asking me that question
because it's easier to talk about it at
that point because it just well
well well because well because i would
argue i would argue
that it's no small thing for someone's
house to burn down and lose everything
of course that's devastating it's no
small thing it shouldn't be taken
lightly
i'm all with that
but i will say i will argue this
it is far more devastating
to live every day of one's life
under the weight of attachment without
even knowing it
and i would say most of them living
absolutely so the question arises there
you don't need to wait for someone's
house to burn down the house has already
burned down a thousand times over
it is the recognition of what attachment
has done to us as human beings on a
fundamental
day-to-day level
that is the real catastrophe
what are we starting not not according
to
not according to a particular event no
matter how devastating it is which it is
but
it is far more devastating
to live
70 years
under the weight of attachment
no doubt it ruins it ruins it ruins the
quality of one's life
because one lives under fear anxiety
pain misery strife hope disappointment
failure
that that becomes part and parcel of
one's life
that becomes the only thing he knows
what's the alternative
the alternative is freedom
freedom
from the mind
freedom
from attachment
freedom
from seeking
freedom from hope
freedom
from wishing that tomorrow will be
better than today
and therefore never really arriving at
tomorrow
well we've definitely experienced that
here for some people for a lot of people
who hasn't
everyone experiences that everyone lives
there
the real tragedy isn't death
the real tragedy is life
what are some things that we can do to
start to
live a life
of freedom i'm not going to say get
there because
i don't think we're there yet but what
are what are some steps that we can
start to take
so we can start to lose that
well i don't think that if there's a we
anything
there's no we
there's probably
there might be three people there might
be three people who are listening to
this podcast
who might become ready at some point in
their life
okay so there's no we anything it really
comes down to not doing anything at all
it is
it is understanding
that your problems will never go away
no matter how elaborate the fix
the technique
or the methodology may be
you cannot escape your problems
and because you cannot escape your
problems
you will live a life of torment and
anxiety
interspersed by a few joyful
moments that will be your life
the only way out of that
is for what i just said
to absolutely not be okay
all right so let me end with this what
are you most optimistic about
nothing i don't believe in optimism
what are you looking forward to
nothing
i'm not looking forward to anything
i do not want
i do not want tomorrow to bring me
something
because if i want that i'm going to keep
looking over there
so
if i have a journey
if i have a devotion
it is to become 100
totally and completely free
of all imprisonments of my mind
and on a scale of one to five where are
you
no i know an impossible question to
answer
i i
i am five
with regard to my level of devotion
and is that all that counts right now
that's the only thing that really works
all right well i'm gonna cheat and ask
you one more question people want to
know do you set goals
no
do you believe in setting goals if
you're running a company and you're
running a public company you have to
have some
something for people to look forward to
i think that relates to
why you started it in the first place
what is the thing that you truly want
to achieve
a vision
what is your arrival
and
that is a
that is not as easy as a question as it
they sound of course because
the arrival has far more to do
with the deepest sense
of unmitigated
satisfaction
that it does with achieving
a sense of pleasure
that is
i think that
gets to the essence
of the matter
well that's pretty appropriate um
obviously we can sit here for hours but
i think most importantly
what i hope that we did with this
segment is address some of the key
questions that people have
and you know i will continue to
encourage anyone that
listens to our work or subscribes to our
work to
do yourself a favor and
dig a little bit deeper into kapil's
work
not only his books and his discourses
but take some time to reflect to journal
to really try to capture
the messages that he's trying to tell
because
for me personally i mean the one thing
that sticks to me is this whole idea
that you said all problems are
problems of the mind
there is no conflict everything is
self-conflict i've tried to come to
grips with that but you know i'm about
as candid as anybody it's really
difficult and uh maybe i'm over
complicating it but uh you know when i
see the work that you do i'm inspired
to
try to get to that level of desire that
that you talk about so for people that
are listening do you have any parting
words
no
how come i knew that was gonna happen
so today we're to dive into a topic that
kapil in particular has been hearing a
lot about from you
um and i think it's it's fascinating
it's the perspective on parenting
so kapil let's dive into it and um i
want to start with
i want to pick up on a conversation that
you and i were having right before
thanksgiving
when i asked you about
your son your oldest son amman coming
home
after his first semester at oklahoma
state university where he is part of
the top-ranked cowboy golf team out
there and we were talking about how well
he did and how well he adjusted and i
made a reference
that
i felt like
his upbringing and the home environment
that you guys created for him
helped him in that adjustment and you
started to challenge me a little bit on
that why
because nothing is that clean
um
you know
parenting is very much a
uh
it's a search
it's a
um it isn't it isn't a linear
uh pursuit
so nothing so nothing is that clean like
i will never i
i
i would never accept that
you know that i am a quote good parent
um i don't know what that means to be
honest with you well i'm going to get
that in a minute but yeah the in you
created an environment that has helped
this young man believe enough in himself
to play competitive golf for as long as
he's been playing and to go play for is
only like eight people on the team for a
team that's ranked number one in the
country division one
they're not a whole lot of people that
could just by osmosis learn how to
handle that type of pressure uh
you know so
so what so what are you saying
be
be frank what you're saying that the
environment that you guys created at
home
was a catalyst
to helping him adjust the way he did
deal
with
the stage that he's on in the manner
that he's dealing with i just i think
that that it's that he's too young to
just have acquired all that on his own
well
i think one of the catalysts that you
create as any parent is that you create
a catalyst for a person to want to be on
his own
um
you know
i i i cannot
you know
i you you were giving me way way way too
much credit and that's why i challenged
you on it because i think i've done
far far more wrong than i have right
so to speak
i have made far more many mistakes
than i have done things uh you know in a
wise fashion
and you know what is it that leads us on
this search towards wisdom it probably
it is precisely doing things
uh in a way that isn't effective so
um so no i mean yeah i guess it didn't
happen through osmosis i mean we've been
we've been um
you know we've been maniacally going at
this for
gosh how many years now i mean over a
decade um
so this has been the hub of our of our
existence and traveling
the world uh
you know pursuing golf tournaments and
training and the rain and the cold and
the wind and the snow and the ice and
the dark i mean
it's it it really has been a maniacal
pursuit um
and
that uh to be honest doesn't make for a
very easy life so you know so
so i cannot i cannot agree that it's
this rosy picture
whenever you have when wherever
where wherever there's ambition
there's there tends to be problems um
and i'll be the first one to admit i've
always grown up as a very ambitious
person
and
um i think that that i think that
there's some caution in in ambition
um
excessive drive as much as i believe in
it and
and and as much as it it invests me
um
i
must be honest and and say that
excessive drive
uh also
um sabotages a level of peace
so
i cannot
i cannot sit here and take credit for
although with my osmosis but i but
you know
that
he is doing well because
i taught him to do well but i can't
i can't say that i mean it
a lot of these things just happened
because of the kid and because of um
wanting to be on his own which i think
that we all want to do
and while we all want to be free
um
so i that's why i challenged you on it
it isn't that clean
nothing is ever that clean well i want
to get into i want to take a step back
and
and really talk about what parenting is
from your perspective and
what a modern parent does and does not
do but i want to go back to
i want to stick on this point for a
moment because
you wrote a discourse about it
i'm sure you probably don't remember but
i want to read a segment of it to you
and i want you to get it i want you to
comment on it because you touched on it
briefly when you talked about
the sun asking and they may not be
asking you but asking in general why did
you not teach me the proper way to do
things
and the response was
you know when you were small i had so
much to teach you
i was overjoyed by the times i tried to
guide you and instruct you
but all my efforts failed
and the reason that i failed is because
i had to teach you what i was not able
to teach you was wisdom
they were
born the ideas that i taught you were
born out of my own limited experiences
they were born out of my own biased
views truth be told i do not know what
is right and what is wrong
explain that to me
100
um
you know right and wrong is something
that we use and i used it just a little
bit ago
and i used it in the sense of
to imply that
um
not everything was based upon wisdom
and so
um
all we can do
what we call teaching are the things
that we think we know
and the things that we think we know are
the result of our own limited
experiences which we tend to have the
habit of extrapolating into a universal
experience
and as some sort of universal truth and
it's not
we
when we raise kids when we have kids we
bring all of our
all of our effective points and all of
our ineffective works
and
in many ways
raising children is like victims raising
victims
because when you have children
you are not
fully you have not achieved some kind of
enlightenment or
great massive wisdom
you are still learning yourself about
who you are and who you are knocked and
what the world really is and what life
is
and so it's very much an an on-the-job
novice training
um
so that's what i meant by you know
teaching the child through limited
experiences and not knowing what what
really is right and what really is wrong
we consider to be right things that make
us feel good and we consider to be wrong
to think of the things that make us feel
bad
and that is hardly a litmus test for
what is truth and what is not
but you've shared experiences
and and some of the experiences may have
been good and some of the experiences
may have been bad and he can even you
know the boys can make their own
decisions on that but doesn't that give
them a leg up on understanding hey if
i'm faced with a similar experience at
least i've known how my parents
handled it
yes i suppose
um
isn't that better than having
experiences and experiencing it for
themselves for the first time
i don't think it's a question of
having it versus not having it
i think that's a question of what the
entire framework looks like
i think it's the way that the puzzle
pieces are arranged
as opposed to opposed to whether the
piece is there or not
so um
so if you ask it from a very narrow
point of view who isn't having the
experience better than not well yes but
but
um
there could have been see i look at it
as there could have been so much more
truth there could have been so much more
wisdom
that
um
that i wish i would have known
you know back then
that i didn't know and those things
those things um
are troubling to me
i don't like not acting out of wisdom
and acting out of ignorance
so
you'll probably you'll get a challenge
for me
probably from every direction
if
you come at it from the standpoint of
you know i did a good job or whatever it
is
it's i just don't view it that way i
i i have a habit of very much looking at
my own deficiencies far more than any
small triumphs
well one of the things that excited me
when we were having that conversation
last week was when you brought up this
topic and you brought up this topic as
being
you know one of these lead topics on on
these podcasts
i happen to personally feel that one of
the greatest responsibilities of society
moving forward is for parents to step up
you know i think we put too much
credence on
you know people outside the household
to create opportunities and to try to
try to help the next generation evolve
so if you take a step back 19 years ago
today
you had your son
and you guys became parents for the
first time
what were you thinking back then do you
remember what type of parents you guys
wanted to be
nearly two decades ago
i think when you have a child for the
first time you're sort of
in a way blindsided
you don't know what to do
you you do whatever instinct says
you
learn for the first time how to feed and
what to say and not say and
you're
you're so thrown into feeding schedules
and diaper changes and and all those
things you're you're in a frenzy you
don't know what to do right
um
so
i think because all of your efforts
and all of your attention
is so wrapped up into
um
sort of the minute by minute which needs
your immediate
attention
that
um deep introspection into how to raise
a child are is not really at the
forefront i think those things come
later on as time goes on in the years
past
and
and things aren't so immediately
necessary and urgent in your faith you
know as as
as when the
child is born
um
that's when you sort of gain the time
and the space
to reflect um the older that they get
so as you reflect now
what do you feel are the most important
responsibilities of a modern parent uh
okay let's speak true i think that i
think that
the number one thing which has to be
understood by anyone listening to this
podcast is that there is nothing that
i'm going to say that this is what you
need to do and this is not how about to
do it that you should parent this way
and don't parent that way
i completely and utterly and totally
categorically deny
all behaviors
and all do's and don'ts and tips and
recommendations and
that's that's complete nonsense to me i
i think it's totally irrelevant that are
that the like great majority of people
that would be listening to this are
either
really advocates of yours or have been
following us and they understand where
you stand with that so we get it but
guess what we want to get inside your
brain to understand
what even if from your perspective
right if amman was one years old now
yeah
what what would you feel with the wisdom
that you've gained over the last you
know 20 years in particular how would
you feel
you
would need to parent him and know his
soon-to-be brother
there is a
natural instinctive tendency
never to question yourself
there is a natural instinctive tendency
to believe
that the way that you feel things should
be
is the way things should be
i think that is one of the most
important things
that happened that is one of the most
critical things that happens to us
that is really a blindfold
there is no opportunity
there is no
um
there is no space
between ourselves
and the thing that we think is the right
thing to do
there is a
natural tendency to believe in our own
godhood as parents
a parent has
has too much
power
true these are the things that i
these are the things that i have learned
the position
is far too powerful
you have too much say
when they're small
that you get to choose
everything
and the problem with that
is when any human being has too much
power he's corrupted
there are no consequences
so what would you
when you when you think about i would
say it's recognizing that fact
that's what i would say is there's no
doing you you're going to ask me what to
do i'm never going to tell you anything
to do
it it is it is the recognition
it is direct every doing
the real doing is a non-doing
the ultimate action is understanding the
ultimate action is recognition
seeing is the ultimate tooling seeing is
more doing than any possible doing you
could do
and that's what i love about you
and i and and that's what i really enjoy
and appreciate about these conversations
but i still have a point of view from
the perspective that i know you guys did
a lot of things right
we can talk about the things you did
wrong all day long right but you did a
lot of things right you got two great
boys that are pursuing
i'm not even going to use the word
passion because they may be passionate
about golf but there's pursuing
something that they can they feel like
they could really excel in
what are the most important things that
you guys got right
i i
you know
i don't know if my mind just doesn't go
that way i'm texting your wife on the
other line so tell me the truth
it's i
you know if you want to know the truth
you're not going to hear truth
in terms of the things we got writing
it's far easier to tell you about the
things we got wrong i mean honestly
i i don't know
i don't know honestly i don't know it
i don't i don't know is such a truthful
answer
um
i don't
you know
if like if you decode all of this
i don't i can't tell you this is what we
got right this is it
it's far far easier to tell you what you
got wrong because because the
consequences of wrong become visible to
you the consequences are right not so
much
so tell me what you got wrong um
not creating that space
between myself and how i view things um
believing in the power of my position
without questioning it
um
not viewing things from the perspective
of the child more often
being
intoxicated too much by my own drive
or whatever it was for
and are you referencing golf when you're
talking about that
i'm referencing everything um
but probably the most thing i was driven
about was golf yes
i think that's what we did that's what
that's what they excelled at that's what
they wanted to do that's what we
that's what everything was
well there are eight kids playing on the
oklahoma state golf team
they're number one in the country
if i were to ask him
you know or
the the 10 years that you worked with
your dad
to get to this position worth the
opportunity to play
what would he tell me
i don't know
and i'm going to go on a limb and say
he'd probably say yeah absolutely it was
worth it
but i want to take i want to go back to
a point that you made that i think is
really really critical which is looking
at the world from the kids perspective
what causes us not to do that
i think
what prevents
a parent from looking through the
perspective of a child
is
a facet of human nature
which is that
unless a human being is required to do
something
he won't
unless his
back is against the wall unless he feels
a consequence
he
he will not
be compelled
to
do anything
other than what is most instinctive and
readily available to him
no human being acts unless there's a
consequence without a consequence
um
a person will act
and will act and act upon
whatever
infant is available to him he
he will
he will avail himself of the luxury
of
godhood
which is why i think
parents have too much power
well isn't the consequence of raising
good kids
that have high character no no
no you don't know that at the time
you don't know that at the time but
don't you get a glimpse of it
no you don't have that
you don't have that wide angle lens
when they're very small
um
everything is just too new
you are a different person
than you were before you had kids after
you've had kids you know you have a very
hard time remembering what it was like
not to happen
so
you you are
you are thrust into a role with which
you have no familiarity
so
your physiology is different everything
is different and so
you you are
you are put in this position of throat
and
it's too much too soon
but we do it i think you fall back on
your human nature
and then human nature is
self-first
so how would you describe the love you
have for your voice
you know you have raised a black box of
a little word
um
that's a very difficult it's a very
difficult word to define
and i don't know what it means
i don't know what the word love but i
know what the word attachment means
but i know for a i know for a 100
percent fact
that the vast majority of time that the
word love is used it is actually
describing attachment
sure i can see that i'm with you on that
okay so
so what's a problem i think
for what
the relationship that you both of you
guys
have with your boys
i don't know what a proper term is i
think honestly the proper term probably
is learning
that's probably the most proper term is
to learn
is to learn what
what the truth about it really is
is to learn
what ways are effective and what is not
more importantly it's to learn what are
the instincts that you have as a parent
where they come from and to make certain
that they are not coming
from a place that has no feedback loop
so that you don't become corrupted by
your own power
if if i were to ask the boys how would
they describe their relationship with
you guys how would they describe it do
you have an idea
the only thing that would matter
is what they actually said
the guess is just
theoretical kitchen so what do they tell
you
about what what what tonight what
about the relationship that you guys had
developed because one of the things too
that you had said in in one of the
discourses or
was that hey the ultimate reason
that you love
in this context him in this discourse
was because you abandoned all need from
him and from anyone and anything else in
the world
yeah that's that's absolutely true yeah
um
what happens is
see all these tendencies tend to come up
i mean everything is cause and effect
right
so one of the effects of having the
child is that all of your attention goes
on the child now when i first when i say
when i make that statement
it's an innocuous statement and it
sounds actually reasonable and logical
and of course your attention should go
on the child
but when i say that your attention goes
on the child
i'm talking about not just the gaze of
the tension but the weight of it
i think that
i think that that
that everything
the the spotlight becomes too bright and
that creates sort of
uh a sense of imprisonment i think
because too much attention was on the
child
not in the attention of tending to their
needs and that kind of thing but
intention in terms of expectation
and meet it
you you you fall into the trap of
attachment
and with attachment comes neat and you
and no matter how innocuous and how
innocent and
and
um
societally acceptable it may be that
need may be
it's still a need and it isn't that it's
wrong to have needs or right to have
needs because what is the effect of
having a need and the effect of having a
need
is that
it imprisons the child to be to have to
satisfy that need
and if that meat is not satisfied
then there's turmoil there's turmoil for
the one for not having satisfied it
there's a turmoil for one whose need was
not fulfilled so how would you describe
when you take a step back
how would you describe the relationship
that you have developed with the boys i
i yeah i'll tell you right now the
relationship that i have developed
is
to watch me
learn about my own deficiency 95
of the conversations that we have now
are about the things that i have learned
and the things that i still have to
learn
and the wisdom that i need to
acquire
and to learn why some of the things the
why things that we do we do
where
where the cause and effect of things lie
what the mind does to us those are sort
of those are the conversations that we
have so as they observe that
obviously those are
experiences
that they can take and apply to their
own life you agree
no sure but that's theoretical
but yes
i mean it it wouldn't matter to me if
they never applied it because that isn't
why i did it i didn't i don't do it in
order to teach
i am in many ways so beyond teaching
um
you know
i i do it and i did it because
it is
a way for me to shed light on the truth
behind all these relationships and so
that i can learn
i didn't do it in order to
watch me and look how introspective i'm
being so that you can then learn that no
it has to be pure it has to be genuine
and
if there's any sense of uh listen if a
child of any sin that you're trying to
teach him something he shuts off so it
isn't about it isn't about teaching it
isn't it isn't about you know look at me
it's you know whatever wears off wears
off and you can never predict what wears
off what wears off and the things that
they hear are things that you never even
thought they hurt and the things that
you emphatically stated are definitely
the things they didn't hear so that's a
no-win game that goes nowhere if you're
going to be authentic and true to
yourself and state um what you feel
about things and why you think think
things are the way they are and
you're
you're you're doing it inside yourself
even though you're doing that loud in
front of them
then do it but as a way to teach them
that it becomes disingenuous so when
they watch you and observe you talk
about
the mind the imprisonment of the mind
what it does to us and what it does for
us how do they take that and translate
it into their own life people come to
you and engage you and pay you a lot of
money to try to help them deal with it
maybe not conquer it but deal with it
you have two young boys at home that
have great character that want to do
something with their lives when they ask
you those questions how do you respond
oh i respond totally honestly um but but
there's a difficulty with that response
why do they take it differently than
than anyone else no there's a there's
there's a there's a difficulty with my
response because my response is you know
and i'm trying to make them 100 pure but
oftentimes they're not
my responses
are uh they're the truth
but they're tinged with a thread of
desire in other words and once again
this is going to be pursued as well
what's wrong with that well to me
there's a problem um you know
there can be no desire if to arrive at a
hundred percent truth and a hundred
percent wisdom there can be no desire on
my part as to how far they go and how
successful they become okay so if there
is then even though i gave them the
truth that lining of desire
makes it lose its power a bit but they
still want to know you're you know
sometimes sometimes
mommy and daddy are superheroes right i
want to know hey if dad has gotten a
glimpse
of what it takes to not be imprisoned by
his mind or mom with her mind i just
want to know whether or not i can do it
myself is another thing but i want to
know how did you do it no no that is not
a that is not a teenager question that's
a 49 to
72 year old question so i'm asking in
some cases
yeah
as a 25 year old i'm asking you yeah
most 25 year olds wouldn't even ask that
question
that's that's a that's a later in life
question no one
you you don't get to that kind of
question yes there are some 20 year olds
that i've worked with that have asked me
that question it's very rare usually
you're 35 and up so give me a glimpse of
what you say so what question so ask the
question to the whole idea of the the
notion of experiencing
the
the mind and why it imprisons us and
what i can do about it to at least gain
some element of freedom from
well no one asks it that purely everyone
comes at it because there is something
that is deeply troubling them and then
that becomes their entry point into this
conversation if someone is perfectly
so-called happy or content they're not
going to have any interest that's a
question that question is not going to
arrive that kind of question only arises
from pain so i want to know right i want
to get rid of frictions in my own life i
think it comes down to a desire to want
to stop playing the game
the game of conflict followed by
temporary resolution
followed by
rekindling of the conflict followed by
other resolutions
followed by confusion followed by
sadness followed by
forgiveness followed by apology followed
by conflict against that whole game
one has to arrive at the point
where he recognizes that this apology
and this forgiveness and this
end of conflict is uh only it's only a
matter of time before it begins again
because it is it is extraordinarily
convincing that once you know apologies
and so forth are made and the conflict
ends that this is going to be it and
it's never it so
um the reason that it continues is
because that is not theme it is it is
was inclined to believe that that's it
so when one reaches a point that he
fully and without a single doubt
recognizes and sees once again that
it is absolutely going to continue then
he begins to ask different questions
then he stops asking how do i end this
conflict how do i make the other person
feel x and y
what did i do wrong and how should i
improve my behavior and what should i
say he stops asking those questions
which only lead to more confidence and
he starts asking questions like the one
you asked about how do you get to the
point of freedom
so that's where it arises from there's
some level of pain that usually is the
the um impetus for um exploring this
deep realm and what do you discover it i
mean what have you discovered about
yourself that gets in the way of us
getting rid of that pain i know it's not
self forgiveness yeah no um getting rid
of the pain i think is a
understanding that personally no one
really ever does anything to us and that
all of the things that we do we do to
ourselves and
that part and parcel with that in the
very same breath i will say that just
because we do it to ourselves it does
not mean that there is self-blame so
there cannot be any guilt and there
cannot be any blame and i sort of don't
like what i just said because it came
across as too prescriptive and someone's
going to write that down okay from now
on i'm going to practice by having guilt
and not having blame and in doing so
they just ruined the whole game but it
goes back to the notion that you've
shared many times that i think
is really kind of a defining
characteristic of
what we deal with was this this whole
idea that all conflict is self-conflict
whether you consider that a prescription
or not that's real
and as long as we can understand that
and experience that that in and of
itself can it lead
help us get on a path yeah yes
absolutely why do you say i mean that
why do you say that most human beings
will never be content with who we are
you know
how you can't be content with something
that you don't understand you can't be
content
with with something that's always
changing how are you going to build your
house on shifting sand so is that a is
that a constant path to misery well it
doesn't go anywhere to be content with
who you are
basically means that you are content
with who you think you are and who you
think you are is essentially a bunch of
personality trait how can you be content
with a bunch of personality traits those
traits are going to change according to
whoever you meet in the street there's
no solid ground so what's a better way
to reframe you
the wrong word
well
well the thing that you're trying to be
content with is the wrong word you can't
be content with a moving target so what
does that lead to
none of us want to live miserable lives
yes yeah and i think the number one the
number one understanding that has to
arise from that is that if you do not
want to live a miserable life then what
must be understood is that the pursuit
of any prescription will absolutely
cement your misery and the reason that
that is the case is because whenever you
try to fix something you only perpetuate
it because these things are not fixable
they're only seeable fixing is
manipulation and whenever you manipulate
something
you may fix one side but then you have
ruined the other side so it is enough
for us to understand this whole idea
absolutely content with who we are well
you said it too easily you said it
is it enough for us to understand that
we're not going to be content with who
we are you didn't emphasize the fact
that the reason that that is not
possible
is i mean that was almost that was going
to be that's going to be due to the
defeatist statement and and what i'm
saying is that the reason that
contentment with the self is not
possible is because the self is a moving
target who you believe yourself to be
about who you really are because it's
constantly changing yeah well that's the
mind the mind is like the weather right
the mind changes every five minutes if
you're sad just wait 10 minutes and
you'll be feeling something else
how are you going to plan a flag there
we try only because only because it is
seen as immovable only because it is
seen as something solid so you you
always fascinate me and i want to just
i want to kind of take a loop back to a
question i asked you before and maybe
just end with with some thoughts on
parenting
the question i asked you before again
was something
that you had referenced about humans
never allowing themselves to stray too
far from their competition and the
reason i had asked you that was because
we're a product of our own environment
we're product of our environment at home
or product of our environment with our
inner circle and certainly at work and
so forth and so on
the few
that
stray from that environment what what
are they doing
to get away from
their competition what are they doing
what are these top golfers and
you know elite ceos that you're working
with that choose not to put themselves
on that same playing field as their
competitors well i i didn't say that
people that that the select few don't
stray from their competition so that
they don't stray too far so the
competition's always in sight right so i
wouldn't say that professional golfers
stray from the competition but almost at
all you know
they they you know professional golfers
like many other professionals and other
in other domains
they you know they spend their lives
trying to they spend their careers
trying to differentiate themselves from
one another but in fact what they do is
become one of them it's very nipotistic
they they
they they speak the same language they
talk the same coaches they listen to the
same
instructions they read the same books
you you can't help but become each other
because they live in this in this closed
environment in which you know the vents
in that environment blow this this sort
of manufactured
air which has a fundamentally different
you know uh percentage of oxygen and
then and that is than that which is
present in the real world so everyone
sort of drinks the kool-aid and that's
true even in all aspects of life i think
well that's because yeah it's the nature
of human beings but but if one begins to
understand that deeply
then he no longer needs the competition
other than fear what keeps us stuck
there
the uncomfortableness of being alone and
you just gotta you gotta just accept
that and deal with it i i hate the word
deal with i don't like to deal with um
uh you don't have to accept anything or
deal with any it's it's understanding
what your natural proclivities are as a
human being and if you understand
and see your natural tendency
only then do you have
uh the insight and the opportunity to
not succumb to that so speaking of that
maybe we wrap up with this
how do you at this stage in your life
how do you guys become a great resource
for your boys as they continue to grow
up as they continue to pursue their
professional endeavors you told me what
you did wrong
you probably did few things right
but what is it
that moving forward you've got two
special teenage boys
how do how does the household
continue to be useful to them
as
they continue to grow up by being honest
about everything
that's fair and and you probably find
that that that's the minority well yeah
but i won't judge anybody um
but it's the truth
it is well it is and that's just a tends
to be a habit that
you know everyone tends to pull punches
and flinch and and so forth um
but
very few people are honest with
themselves
because they have ready-made answers
that their culture has given them as to
why they make the mistakes they do
and because they use those pre-packaged
answers they never arrive at the
ultimate truth and therefore they never
become free
so
everything begins with
honesty and encouraging honesty with the
understanding that you know if you speak
your innermost thoughts and feelings
they will be respected so leave leave
everyone listening with a question to
ask themselves
until next time
in fact i put up a question the other
day on twitter to ask your children
which was
what is it that i have never really
understood about you
wonderful
what is it that i haven't really
understood about you that is a wonderful
question
for us to ask our kids
for
us to ask our
you know our closest relationships and
we can go on and on and on but that's a
good place to end we want to dive into
something today that i think is really
relevant for uh all aspects of life
personally and professionally it's this
whole idea of greatness
kapil you deal with it all the time
we were just talking about your kids and
their ascension in golf hopefully we can
get into that a little bit today but
in in framing this conversation about
this pursuit of
greatness or this continual pursuit of
greatness
i'd like us to kind of start by agreeing
on a definition of greatness or ask you
to
tell me what greatness or excellence
looks like
you know it's a good question but i
don't think definitions go anywhere um
all i will say is that
it is
arriving at some
form or fashion of a pinnacle
um in one's profession
and how do we know like like for example
like is a pinnacle in golf is it winning
a major
or is it winning multiple majors i mean
how would you define
that pinnacle
yeah that's undefinable i mean there are
some there are some players
some athletes who look at
their role in professional sports as
making a good living and there are
others who look at it as
becoming a world number one and so
that's all very personal
there's nothing against the person who
looks at it as making a living versus
the world number one um that that's just
a function of how how one thinks
but do you really think that the person
who's looking at it from the perspective
of making a living
which like you said certainly i have
respect for but that is a completely
different mindset than somebody who's
trying to be the best at what they do or
the best in the world at what they do
they're not the same people
that's correct
it's a different form of dna let's talk
about the latter let's talk about the
person who wants to be the best in the
world
walk me through
what it takes to get to that level
i think first and foremost
is
a
a dna which completely rejects one's own
culture
i think the culture
in society
in just regular society
the culture in sports the culture in
business
every domain every discipline has its
own culture
and that culture is composed of the
prevailing beliefs dogmas notions
the traditional way and the status quo
of the way that things are done and
i think
that
a person
who
has the dna
to
completely walk against the grain
because they
harbor a deep-seated
understanding that
the masses and the majority
and the status quo and the traditions
are always wrong and they can that they
can only lead to a very limited
outcome
and i think anybody who has listened to
any of our conversations read any of
your discourses know that that is a
place where you live
you're almost kind of this opposing
perspective
and
if we can
break down this dna for a moment let's
talk about what that dna looks like
certainly
i like to believe that the people who
are going to listen and pay attention to
our conversations are at least seeking
that dna
it's not something that we're all born
with
right it's something that we have to
work towards
and a lot of people talk about hey being
the best in the world a lot of times
isn't fun
because it requires rigor
self-discipline and an enormous
commitment that very few people want to
make would you agree
yeah but it isn't you're going down the
path of hard work
and
i don't have much respect for hard work
i think hard work is largely a form of
anxiety
uh rather than a natural pursuit
um
i think i think hard work is sort of a
it's a middle man
uh it's an intermediary
i don't like middlemen
don't go anywhere
um
yet everything has to be from the
horse's mouth to the horse's mouth and
the hard work is this idea well if i put
in the hours and if i do the quote work
and if i
follow the instruction and if i
work day and night and if i romantically
make my hands bleed
that that will buy me something
and i don't make it better
because i don't think there's a shortage
of people who work hard and get nowhere
so i don't buy the idea of hard work
being a reliable vehicle to anything
in the same way that i don't buy any
intermediary as being a trustworthy and
reliable vehicle to getting anywhere
i think everything arises spontaneously
when the person has no choice but to
quote make it
then
he
might
certainly quote put in the hours
and certainly devote his life to it
and from an external point of view as
someone who is looking at that person
the person who's watching might say oh
look that person's working hard
but that person really isn't using hard
work as a a vehicle it doesn't like a
degree that if i get my degree i'll get
a job it isn't like that um it's if the
hard work is secondary
um the
the
the mania and the obsession and the
uh
that
the possibility of not having it
simply isn't
acceptable and and i'll have to qualify
what i just said because some are going
to hear that as positive thinking and
once again when you reject everything i
have to keep putting disclaimers in
right so uh you know positive thinking
is just
nonsense because the person who
makes it know he's gonna make it he
doesn't positive think his way into it
because positive thinking lies upon hope
and the person who doesn't have a choice
has no hope it's just done it's already
done
and
therefore
he carries out whatever needs to be done
to make it a reality in the real world
after it becomes a reality in his mind
so when i look at myself in the mirror
and i make a commitment to that person
staring at the person in the mirror yeah
i don't like i don't like commitment i
don't like commitment because commitment
is for it's it's forced listen listen
listen so how what so how would you if
you're you're if your boss if you're
hang on if your boss says to you okay um
if if you don't come into work tomorrow
i'm gonna repossess your car repossess
your house
and
i'm going to have you living in the
street if you're not here by nine i can
promise you one thing you are not going
to need to make a commitment to be there
at night i will be there you're right
okay okay so there's no commitment
that's more added steps there's more
that's more more of this academic
jargon okay it's irrelevant there is no
commitment only desire
there's only there's only a a a
non-choice
filled desire
the person who's gonna make it is just
gonna make it he knows it he feels it
like i said everything is done before it
is done so i don't buy anything related
to if i do this then i will get that
that's hope that's commitment that's
discipline i don't buy this believe it
discipline is this discipline is also an
added
extra it is baggage it's irrelevant um
the person who's sufficiently desiring
of it
he will have the discipline but not the
reverse
you can force yourself into a discipline
and you can have your nice morning
routines and all that stuff but that
isn't natural but
it's it's only when you reach a level of
desperation that all those things fall
in place for you you don't pick them off
one by one as some sort of uh
intentional conscious doing
so what gets in the way then of
the great mid overwhelming majority of
us
not having the opportunity to achieve
that level
of greatness that we're talking about
here there has to be something that gets
in the way or a lot of things that get
in the way
sure and i'll tell you one of the main
things is belief
human beings have a habit
of subscribing to belief
and then they go down
a positive thing in the self-development
route
and then they read books about how to
change your beliefs right make them more
empowering and positive uh
self-affirmations and self-talk and all
this stuff
and
you can't believe your way anywhere
either it's a knowing so what gets in
the way
is beliefs belief
is the costliest thing in a human
being's life
so how so what do you replace that with
knowing so do i know
the unknown that hey you don't replace
it with you don't replace it with
anything
you don't replace it with anything okay
the knowing that's there wasn't placed
there it just was okay
you don't replace it with anything it is
the understanding
that if you believe
the things that you are told
you will be
massively
and enormously limited
if you believe
the story that your mind tells you about
yourself you will be massively and
enormously limited
so
you ask questions too quickly mo
when you ask a question and then i
respond
you immediately run away like the stove
is too hot and you jump to the other
side and say well how do you fix that
you haven't heard me yet
you have to hear what i'm saying
not so that you can follow it until you
can that you can
do what i say i'm not saying to do
anything
it's it's
listen with understanding
not sort of
not listening with the opportunity to
ask how because i'm never going to give
it to you because it doesn't exist
so
so
belief is a massive massive problem
and the idea that one must change his
beliefs
is more imprisonment so that's what gets
in the way what gets in the way to be
succinct
what gets in the way
that is that human beings
are very quick to believe that what they
hear either from others or from their
own mind
is true
so who would we trust we're not going to
trust anybody else's opinion or
perspective and not that people's
opinions matter
but who do we trust
that's a wonderful question
you
trust the unnamed
non-entity within you
that speaks to you
and upon its speaking
you immediately know
and what does that look like
did you is that just a
feeling
absolutely absolutely
listen
it is not about
what is there it is about what is there
after what needs to be removed is
removed
so it is not about what is there it's
about what is left
so when a person
subscribes to no belief
not by prescription just genuinely
when he begins to doubt
all the lie that his mind tell him
then the things that remain that had
been trying to come to the surface but
have not been able to because they've
been drowned up by the belief
that thing is finally able to come to
the surface
and that is an unnamed
non-entity
to which i will never give a name
because the moment i give a name to it
there will be a discussion about it and
as long as there's a discussion about it
it will not be seen
so i'm curious what kind of questions
are you asking yourself every day about
your own pursuit
that's a good question
uh
what is it that i have not understood is
the question that torments me about
everything
i know for a fact without
without
a shadow of a doubt
that they are as we sit here at this
very
moment
there are so many things
that
i just don't see yet
and even though i don't see them
i am
a victim of them because of not seeing
them
and
that
deeply bothers me
and has there been something over the
last month or so that you've seen
that opened your eyes to something that
you didn't know before about this whole
seed of greatness
and it's not about epiphanies really
it's about constant refinement of
understanding
that in its aggregate uh results in
epiphany as opposed to eureka and eureka
moments you know
um i think the one thing that we've
discussed before is the idea of uh
self-sufficiency and independence and
arriving at the place where the
inspiration arises from you for whatever
reason as opposed to being imposed upon
you by society or by parents or by
anyone else
well one of the things that i'm learning
about you that's deeply fascinating to
me that i want to
seriously be very conscious of
i see you as someone who's constantly
editing your life
and you know people can take that for
whatever it's worth but you're
constantly reinventing refining and so
forth
what is it over the last couple of years
that you have done to get away from some
of perhaps some of those beliefs that
you personally have had and start moving
towards
understanding where your own greatness
lies
i think it's just i think i think
everything is qualitative uh much more
than quantitative and i think
qualitatively
what matures over time
is not really skill
but sincerity
what matures over time is maturity
um
your level
of understanding matures
it grows deeper
um
it it becomes more nuanced
uh it becomes um
bolstered it is
so it isn't it isn't it isn't from a
zero to one it's
it's um
it may still be
one
but that one is a very different
qualitative one
um
so
it is it is you know one may know for
instance that
um
the story that their mind tells them are
lies okay
he may have heard that okay
that means nothing it does nothing just
because someone heard it they may have
heard it 30 times
still means nothing
but but when that realization begins to
hit
um
that is the qualitative difference
that is the maturity
that is the increased level of sincerity
of that understanding
and so
this is
this is at once at odds with
the manner in which society does things
which is
that it views things from the standpoint
of information
that that
a human being is an invalid who needs to
be filled with information
well
if a human being is an invalid it isn't
because he lacks information
it speak it's that
he doesn't understand the information on
a visceral level
you can pack any amount of knowledge
into a computer
um
but it is it is whether that knowledge
gets into the bloodstream
it means anything and neither is it
about well people are told but do they
actually do well that's nonsense too
there's no doing
doing is all reactive
doing is is a camouflage that is that is
carried out in order to hide the fact
that one does not understand
so i would say
that
it is the quality of one's understanding
that matures over time it isn't
necessarily
the uh quantitative increase in the
amount of knowledge that one uh
that one
sort of
uh garners
so what is the opposite of doing
if we're not doing what are we doing
we're all trying to act in some way
shape or form right
yes
yes but
that everyone's trying to act for the
same reason you ask me how
because understanding isn't
perceived as being a very high value
this is a cosmetic
superficial society
where
botox is the order of the day well no
one's going to argue with that
okay so that botox
pervades all facets of society
so if someone
acts
and they sweat and they bleed and
they're out of breath
they
can show the world and themselves that i
did
and that's why they do it
it isn't to get anywhere
um
i think the idea of getting somewhere
is less appealing to human beings than
the idea of effort
human beings measure themselves by
effort
not by a right
and
it is for this reason that you have
employ employers
who
uh
who
reprimand
employees who are efficient
efficiency
is
very much a liability
in the workforce
a person who's efficient
and gets seven hours of work done within
one hour is considered lazy
because he has six hours of
left over
the person who can
do it in one hour but takes seven hours
is considered hard working
because he worked all day
this is the world that we live in
it is not filled with highly intelligent
people
it is filled with people who follow
others
it is filled with sheep
who do not think deeply
who are reactive who are filled with
conditions the conditioning
and they carry out that conditioning in
their daily lives without ever having
examined what it is that they're
actually doing another common example of
this is is um uh the committees
uh
who are on the board of uh
of colleges and you know universities
and so forth
who look at all the
applications that come in right to see
who they accept
you know those committees are filled
with people who are 60 and 70 years old
and they at 60 and 70
have yet to come to the conclusion
that one's grades and one's test scores
have no bearing whatsoever on their
potential sure the level of intelligence
or where they go in life
how can you get to be 60 or 70 years old
and not come
to that basic realization i can
understand that you're done when you're
20.
but you shouldn't be stupid when you're
70.
there should be a law against that i
mean they say that that you know with
age comes wisdom obviously not
so when you don't spend you you don't
spend
the your days and your time
during the course of those days doing
anything are you spending them and
trying to understand is that where your
head is is that a better term yes that's
absolutely that's where i live yeah
yeah whatever
whatever activity or whatever thing i
may be involved in
i am wholeheartedly
i never leave it i never leave the world
of the of examining how the mind is
influencing me and
what is the truth and what is the lie
that's where i'm defaulted towards
that's what i have spent years
reorienting myself towards to where now
it's automatic that's just
that's just where where the the uh
the the headlights shine immediately
just to discover that
well you said something recently that
really resonated with me and i think
it's very appropriate for one this time
of year but two for this conversation
and
when you were talking about the secret
to change the the secret to people
changing you know keeps us
from
experiencing these dramatic changes
isn't that we don't want to change
it's that we're unfamiliar with who and
how to be in this newfound state
and everybody's thinking about new
year's resolutions and i'm going to be
totally different and do great things
next year
explain this whole idea of what keeps us
stuck isn't that we don't want to change
it's the fact that we're not familiar
with this new who or how
um state that we're going to be in
yeah i think you're referencing the
twitter message and i'm shocked to
actually remember it um
i'm shocked it was
yeah
i think
comfort and familiarity is a
very big deal
and
when you live in a particular town
you know where the grocery store is you
know where the gas station is right you
know where the flower shop is um you
know where your work is you know all the
routes and the different back ways to
get there in case there's traffic right
you you know everything and it's on
automatic pilot um there's a certain
level of familiarity now if you are
dropped off into a new country
and
suddenly you don't know where anything
is then it isn't just as simple as not
knowing where the grocery store is
you're sort of out of your element
you're sort of wandering to see how
things work in this new sort of sort of
place
and
that is
that is very
um that can produce a lot of anxiety
a lot of uncertainty
and human beings like certainty so you
know whether it comes to you know
personal development or
you know learning a new skill or
whatever
human beings never stray too far from
their competition
and they never stray too far from their
current level of skill level
because whenever wherever you live uh
that town the metaphor for that town is
who you believe yourself to be your set
of skills your physical characteristics
your beliefs
um
and so
you have so a person has developed
an identity around those things and
those things are home
so in order to come in order to
to reach a new level of understanding uh
that is significantly
um
uh different
than what one understands right now or
to arrive at a new place of fitness or a
private uh you know a massively
different physical appearance or
whatever it may be
that requires
a relearning
of a completely new environment
and so one has to be
comfortable with and and or
look forward to or embrace naturally not
prescriptively i hate the word embrace
that that new
environment that new town that new city
and
unless that is in place
uh one will never stray too far
yeah i mean and i got a funny story to
share about that but like
like if you have somebody who's very
serious and and and
embraces what you're saying
how do i start to get comfortable with
you why did you pick up on embrace
i knew that you were going to pick up on
that even though i said i hated that
word you're going to use embrace and
then everyone in the audience must say
embrace embrace embrace
this
embrace is not an action it's a natural
occurrence it's like accept right all
like that either because accept is like
forced acceptance
nothing can be forced right if it isn't
already there forget about it it's
useless so
um
what i would tell them is what i just
told you
it is about the unders it is about
explaining to human beings how things
work what they do is up to them listen
the the the sky is blue
uh it's cold in the winter
right
uh
snow falls in canada
all right so
those are the facts those are the truths
right you can ignore them
you can procrastinate you can stay where
you are it doesn't matter
those are the truths
i am never going to tell you which way
to walk because the sec that's what you
want me to do well what's wrong with
giving you what you want well
the reason that you want me to do you
want me to tell you that is because you
don't really want to get there
so i'm not going to help you not get
there
i don't care if you get there
but i'm not going to help you not get
there
so it isn't about what you should do i
would tell them what i just told you
that in order for transformation or a
massive change to occur
a level of comfort or looking forward to
or enthusiasm of the new environment
which is completely foreign to that
person will require a new self-image
most likely
and unless
that is in place and it means the desire
for that is in place
they're never going to stray too far
are you constantly no i and no i did not
say i did not say that make sure that
you enjoy
the new place make sure that you make
yourself
look forward to anything
i said
that is what is required
not that you have to do it
how often are you getting a new
self-image of yourself
oh my god are you kidding me
it isn't about a new self-image it is
complete annihilation of any self-image
how often does that happen regularly
it's not it's not a numbers thing it is
it is a it is a it is a qualitative
divorcing away from the belief in itself
image it isn't i did it 14 times this
week and 17 times last week that's
meditation
i've done 20 minutes how much did you do
well it's how he did 14 minutes and
she's on her way up well she saw that
bag on the street he's a wonderful
meditator and his clothes are just
wonderful and the incense the smell is
fantastic and up to an hour so i'm going
to make myself go to an hour is this
none of that nonsense
it isn't it isn't numbers it isn't
quantity it's quality
it's visceral
what makes success so difficult to
repeat
i mean
however
you know you look at athletics it's easy
to measure athletics as very few teams
ever win back-to-back titles or
you know very few golfers ever win in
the same year
you know that's why we we marvel at
people who win grand slams yeah those
are okay okay those are very interesting
questions okay and those are wonderful
questions because i i love to explore
those questions so you know when golf
had said that you can you know it's very
difficult to follow up a low round with
another low round in golf it's often
said that as you just said that if you
it's often the case
that a um
a person who is a young
uh
a young person on the tour who just got
his tour card you know if he wins once
he probably won't win for a very long
time now it's it's how you and it's true
so well i don't know but
hang on it's true okay it's true
but
you're too enthusiastic about it being
true
okay
okay
the reason that everyone jumps on that
is because they are dying
to express their preformed and
pre-packaged opinion as to why that is
the case and the reason that they are
dying to express their pre-formed and
pre-packaged opinion
is because they have an agenda
what is the agenda the agenda is
professional golf is hard
the agenda is not only is it hard
i need you to believe that it's
massively hard
because we have a brand
and that brand needs to be protected
so we will do all that we can to
separate ourselves
from
the rest of society so we must build it
up
i don't blame them for building it up
it's marketing
okay
but when you live in that room and you
are constantly given that message
guess what you become
so we haven't seen the truth
we have only seen conditioned responses
so that the truth would only be known
if you had two populations
one population continually heard the
message
the kool-aid
the recycled air
and then the other population lived in a
jungle
and they never heard the kool-aid never
drank the kool-aid
and and breed the recycled air
then you could say that even if the even
if the
the
the environment that lived in the jungle
so to speak that was never exposed to
the talking heads and the media and so
forth
in the prevailing dogma
that if they produce the same results
then maybe there is something natural
going on
which might make that true
but you can't say that as long as there
is an interference factor of the media
and the recycled air in the kool-aid
how you cannot say that that is natural
and that is not created and manufactured
by propaganda
it sells books and it sells eyeballs
sure
sure but
the player himself
doesn't really care about that
he's the one who really suffers
right that back to our original
statement when he first started today it
was it's buy into the culture
see the person who rejects everything
who knows that everything out of
everyone's mouth is a lie that person's
got a chance
so i'm being
suddenly he suddenly becomes
he suddenly becomes immune and no longer
subject
to the propaganda
and by the way uh you know you know you
know in order to address quickly the
the um
you know the outraged so to speak
you know they're gonna come back with
well you don't think golf is hard
i think the pda tour is easy you know
that's always the outraged questions
right there there's no interest in the
truth i just want to you know express
outrage and of course golf is difficult
and of course the pga tour is full of
great players um
but
the results that are happening cannot be
ascribed to natural human tendencies
they can be ascribed to interference by
propaganda and the influence of a
cultural environment as a petri dish in
which the players live
i was gonna say i never i've never asked
you this on the record and i think it's
it it kind of bears a conversation
because it's right around this whole
idea of how do you repeat success
a decade ago tiger woods was almost
unbeatable
all right it seems like every time he
would step up uh you know on on a sunday
round he knew that he could win what in
your eyes as an outsider even with
insider information what is the biggest
difference between tiger 10 years ago
and the guy who's
you know doing everything he can to get
back in the game today
well back then tiger was tight
what what did you
well it isn't what i saw it's what he
saw
um
tiger was completely immersed in the
persona that was created and
he rode that motivation and inspiration
and momentum
all the way
that character of tiger woods was the
vehicle
that took him to the top
when
there is a in the armor for
whatever reason
self-doubt creeps in
and a person drops from immortality to
becoming immortal
it's all in the mind
the tiger's talent talent didn't go away
um
i mean sure there was injuries and
that's obviously a factor
but
you know tiger knows how to play
and his understanding of how to play is
superior
to anyone in the game
how to play
tiger
understands the game better than
everyone
that was a large part there was a large
reason for the winds
the other part of the winds
was that
in my opinion
the those who played against tiger
during his
um prime years
felt
the persona of tiger two mm-hmm
so they were out of their element
because they felt like they needed to
hit perfect shots they forced to the
issue
and down the stretch
they sort of fell away
leaving it goes back to what we said
earlier that it isn't what's there it's
what's left
and tiger was you know golf is largely a
game of attrition
and and uh and jack played the same way
jack nicholas did the same thing
he was the last one standing
so
tiger tiger plays very much
in a in a eastern zen style of play and
go to jack
and
going back to the topic of greatness
i think that is a
running thread
amongst individuals who become great is
that they understand how things come to
them
they don't force things and they don't
chase things
they become attractors of things and no
i didn't say anything about the law of
attraction
um
they
they
they understand how the game works
and they try to achieve more by doing
less
it is very very much the opposite of the
western culture it's very easter
you know you'll have jason day for
instance ask tiger woods and you know
you know tiger how it is how is it that
i that i win and
then tiger will give him sort of an
abstract answer and jason will get upset
and say well why can't you just tell me
straight out
and
that's exactly the point is that there
is no straight out
there's no recipe
um it's
it's a
you know it's the color of wind
you know it's it's feeling things
between your fingers it's it's nuance
it's it's touch and feel it's
sensitivity
um
it's art
it isn't science
it's a method
if somebody comes to you tomorrow and
let's say a leader of an organization
who's just had a
record year
in however whether it's for performance
their stock whatever and they come to
you and they say hey you know heading
into this next year
we're deathly afraid to not fall on our
face what can we do
to keep this growth going how do you
respond
well they're looking in the wrong
wrong place and they're asking the wrong
question you know anything that you do
out of fear will fail
what's the what's a better question fear
fear is a great motivator there's no
doubt about it
but that motivation is best spent
examining the holes in one's game
as opposed to
trying to improve one's game
because if you remove the holes
greatness happens by itself
so it really becomes once again
there are no business problems right
they're only human problems
um so so the game
begins
the game is to understand the game
within the game
so it is to understand what is it that i
do not understand
where are the deficiencies in my
360 degree understanding of my business
and how could i understand it better
what are the beliefs that i have
that are causing me problems
it is
those qualitative questions as opposed
to an alarmist
sort of
uh
i need to know what to do in order to
get a certain
it's none of that
that's that's very common thinking
that isn't greatness
um
greatness is very soft
and very deep
and very nuanced and very
incisive
it is it is an examination
it is a desire to know
as opposed to a compulsion to do
there's a phrase that you hear a lot in
whenever you talk about
high achievers or human performance when
people talk a lot about even athletes
themselves or business leaders you gotta
love the process
you gotta love the process it's hard
work trust the process how do you feel
about that
the idea
is valid
the delivery is not
help
it for me
well
it's it's how it's going to be heard
um
it's you know it's kind of like the ten
thousand hours thing right
so
you know i exchanged some very
respectful emails with
anders ericsson
uh florida state
um
at least he wasn't part of state i'm not
sure where he is now
a number of years ago regarding the ten
thousand hour rule and
you know gladwell's popularization of it
through outliers
and i said you know
the problem with the ten thousand dollar
rule
regardless of whether it's valid or not
let's forget about that okay
the problem is that the effect it's
going to have
is going to be counter is going to be
counterproductive
because people are going to hear the 10
10 000 rule and since we live in a in a
how-to society and people are looking
for what to do next and how to this and
five steps to this and list post this
and
nonsense upon nonsense um they are going
to use that and swallow it up as the
higher two they're going to take out
their clocks and they're going to start
measuring hours
which is what is happening
and
nobody
who becomes great
measures the hours and once the alarm
bell goes off the 10 000 hours are up
i'm great
that's that's silly that's fantasy
so
it must be understood moe that in many
ways
whenever you speak
you lie
because
truth is very difficult to capture in
words and and most importantly
the person who is hearing the truth
must be of a sufficient
level of evolution
to
be exposed to it
otherwise they will naturally
react with outrage and how to
and
will not benefit from it at all
so telling someone that it's a you gotta
love the process we're back to sort of
you gotta love being uncomfortable in
the new city once you
become
so highly self-developed
it's not about that
it it may in the end be that that's fine
that may be a truth
but it certainly can't be
the vehicle
because why because people will then say
i must learn to love the process and
that will be fake they will grit their
teeth
and try to love the process
that's nonsense
it is not genuine and anything that is
not genuine natural falls flat
you can grit your teeth today
and you can wet your teeth next week but
eventually either you're gonna open your
mouth your teeth are gonna crumble one
of those two things is gonna happen
because it wasn't natural it was forced
do you see a correlation between
the connection of someone's spiritual
core and their level of success
more specific
am i if i am really working hard
to
to understand the core of my existence
is that am i working towards this
pursuit of greatness am i going to start
to see the closer that i get to
understanding my own truth
is that path
going to be a little bit clearer for me
um i think it will but but but it has to
be
once again i mean
one could view that and say well as long
as i'm i'm
as long as i'm looking for the truth in
myself
that everything will take care of itself
and that'll be that'll become an
intermediary of its own so there has to
be a level of practicality
that is pursued in the specific domain
in which one is working so nothing is
that clean
so my so let's let's put the domain
let's let's keep it in business
right very few business people very few
leaders and companies are going to talk
about the truth in the manner that you
talk about they're not going to talk
about it
certainly it's not happening in
boardrooms right so what is it that we
can start to understand better about the
correlation between one's understanding
of him or herself and their ultimate
output or success
to understand
that everything begins and ends with the
human mind
that all of your problems that exist
and all of the
ways that exist to
uh
great success and to greatness all exist
within the mind and not in methodology
it does not exist in the
uh in the world of activity or action
or strategy
or business ideas or business
development
or
seven ways of following
people who are a success or
buying business books
it is once again
we've come full circle
it is a complete rejection of the
idea
of
status quo
it is a complete
a person has to have that dna
to totally reject the status quo
all right two more things for you all
right i want to talk a little bit about
adversity that's one of the things that
often comes up again when you talk about
sustained excellence is that you all of
us have to deal with it and the ones who
are able to
get past whatever adversities they're
dealing with have a better opportunity
to to experience that sustained
excellence what is the
method
if there is a method for you to think
about adversity when something
out of the ordinary happens
what do you do to start thinking about
it
to understand where it came from
to understand the lack of so to
understand
the to understand the holes in one's
understanding
and what
what that situation represents as
opposed to what to do about it
one has to understand
that reflexively jumping to a solution
will create
more and more problems
and that is a
that is very as a very foreign construct
that is a very
um
[Music]
out-of-the-world sort of
idea that is different from
uh traditional society and business
because everyone looks for solutions
the thing is
the solution to any problem
is hidden
and it's hidden in the most ingenious of
places which is in the very deep center
of the problem
so the only person who finds it
is the person who understands the
problem
but nobody wants to look at the problem
they want a fix for the problem
and when you seek fixes to problems
you go on an endless goose chase for
more and more fixes
and thus you get more and more problems
are there a question or two that you ask
yourself when something like that
happens
what
what is the
gap in understanding
about
about knowing
that
one must look at the problem and not
seek a solution how can nothing
misunderstood
why does an extra question have to be
added
because people want to know like you
said we live in a solution they want to
know if they want to know that i just
told them what to know
you know which leads me to i want to ask
you this last question because it came
directly
from as a result of our last
conversation our last conversation was
on parenting but i don't think this
question is is as much related to that
but it's not about the idea of patience
several people
ask me to get your insight on patience
you know people who listen to you know
that you're not a very patient person
right it's kind of this whole idea of
trust the process no you want to get to
the result
give me your thoughts on patient are you
a patient person
no absolutely not
uh
patience is one of those
you know things that
that is uh that echoes across the halls
of the ivory towers has nothing to do
with practicality
in the real world you know patience is
like
patients are like compromise
it's fine to be patient and compromise
on the things that you don't really care
about
but things that you really want
why would you be patient but don't they
take time that doesn't this level of
greatness that we're talking about takes
i'm not gonna you know
look at myself in the mirror get get to
that level of desire that you're talking
about today
and okay why not why not why not
listen you know this is the problem with
human life it's just too long
you know the question that you asked me
just now you wouldn't be asking me if
our lifespan was 35 years old
you wouldn't be asking me this question
you asked me this question because our
lifespan is you know 80 years old
therefore we got 50 more years to waste
patience
compromise
they don't have any place in things that
are significant
um
if if things take time
that's that's nature's business it's not
your business
right so so if you sit and you wait
because you're trying to be patient
right
my question is
how do you know how long to wait
you don't
okay so then that means you just be
patient your whole life
or you can quit
might as well you've already with your
patient
that's what i appreciate so much about
you man and i when i got asked that
question
um
you know it was it was very interesting
and i knew the response
but again it's very counterintuitive to
what you hear about patients and
developing people patience and you take
golf for example you're not going to go
out there and win your first tournament
right but you got to trust the process
and you got to keep doing what you're
doing
yeah i don't believe in faith
i believe in what i see before me
i trust nothing
okay
um
the uh idea of well one day it'll come
i okay what if it doesn't come do i get
my years back
no not yet maybe in the future with ai
well well the thing about belief is that
you better be right because if you're
wrong in your beliefs
the years that you spend
are going to be mighty costly to you
you're never coming back
so no i don't
patience has a very um
as a very it's not a virtue for you
no absolutely not urgency is a virtue
now is a virtue
you know
if your house is burning down you don't
not patience are you
right
you know
patience once it's for things that you
don't care about
the things that you really want
you want them now
you're urgent
you'll do whatever you have to do and as
long and you'll work you'll work all
night long
but the last thing you'll do is hit the
table and say i'm going to be patient
and i'm gonna trust the process and have
faith that one day it'll come
what if it doesn't
who are you gonna blame
because the same person told you to be
patient and one day it'll come and have
faith
what's he going to do for you
if it doesn't work out what can he do
besides say i'm sorry
so on
so the lack of understanding you know
ignorance has consequences
when was the last time someone really
impressed you
well i can tell you
people who i'm inspired by
the the greatest source of inspiration
in my life was buddha
and i don't care and i don't give two
sets about what he said couldn't care
less
i don't want to hear
right
it was
it was
okay so
you know speaking of you know so
speaking this i think recently i put up
on twitter that the middle is the worst
place to be
and
but yet a lot of people attribute the
buddha to saying the middle yeah
okay so let me ask you this so the
middle is moderation right
right they yeah
that's where all harmony is
okay so let's once again don't have any
faith you speak english i speak english
we can understand basic concepts right
so
so buddha said
that
i will sit under
this tree
and i will sit on this spot
and
my bones may break and my skin may
wither
but i will not rise from this spot
until i reach enlightenment
so
whose moderation is that
yeah i see it
okay
okay so moderation is nonsense
okay
uh
the middle way
once again it's like dumbing down for
the masses
um it's
how
a person who was willing to sit in one
spot until he dies
that's the middle way
that's balance
uh and and speaking of patience
um
you know drank his own urine
emaciated you know his body
on the verge of death
because he wanted to get to enlighten is
that patience
nothing about the buddha
is patient
or middle way
once again i don't care what he says i
don't even believe that what he said is
what he said
unless
what
the things that he did coincide with
that
that i that i i buy because it makes
perfect sense because it that's the way
things usually work
things work by way of urgency and
intensity
and by way of a fire
not by way of a trickle you know it
doesn't work that way
so yeah people
people like to believe things because
they sound nice and they fit into their
nice
orderly organized framework that you can
teach in classrooms and then ask
multiple choice questions about okay
that's the world
it doesn't do with reality
because if that was reality
then you could basically teach everyone
to be great
by following a prescription wouldn't
that be cool
no it wouldn't
absolutely no question absolutely not
yeah they're
you know
nothing great happens by way of
democracy
you know meritocracy
is
far more
um valuable to human beings
you know one of the
one of the the greatest advantages that
a person with driven dna has
is that he knows that the rest of the
human beings are not going to be equally
driven
yeah so why would you why would you
remove that inborn advantage
fascinating stuff my man
why don't we leave everyone with an
important question that you would ask
them to ask themselves
between now and our next conversation is
there one question that that for people
i'll just leave them with the question
that i always ask myself because it is
the most is the driving force behind my
life
and that is what is it that i do not
understand
and i don't recommend that anybody ask
it
because if they do it'll be done in
mechanically
so how the hell do we approach it
whatever seeps into your bones without
your permission
has already seeped into your bones
there is nothing intellectually or
consciously that needs to be done
let it be right and kapil i want to
start i want to jump right in and i want
to start with a broad question
that so many of us deal with all the
time it's this notion of being good
enough
from where you sit right now
how come so many people
feel that they just don't measure up in
whatever domain personally or
professionally
i think the
the rules and the standards and the
the litmus test
and
the
parameters
and the criteria
that one uses to
judge uh one's self-worth
uh
and that constant comparison of
where one is there's versus where one
should be
and the beliefs and the notions and the
ideology
and the conditioning that exists within
um
a household
or within
a workplace
or within a
with an arena of sports
um
and
all of those messages
sort of sort of stand as a
a big
comparison chart
a big standard against one against which
one judges
where one
is
and
naturally when you have that
uh everyone is gonna sort of feel
uh that they've come up
sure
i think self-worth is in many ways
it's a
it's sort of a chasing a ghost
because
you know a human being doesn't really
know who he is
so as a result he has an image
and that image is based upon his
experiences
and what he has been told and what he
has accomplished and what he has failed
at
and all of those go into that
equation
of making that self-image
and forever and ever and ever and every
individual spends his entire life trying
to improve upon
that self-image
towards a quote better self-image uh
something that is considered to be more
in keeping with what society wants and
what is deemed to be successful and what
is deemed to be more healthy and
appropriate and correct
and wherever you have rules you have
problems
um so it is it is it's inevitable
that self-worth
is going to be an issue because wherever
there is any type of image that image
can never be enough
so if we let me unpack that a little bit
let's start with this whole idea of
comparing oneself for one's business
with competitors or with other people
um
what is your view on that do you do you
never do that do you never look at
yourself kapil gupta and compare
yourself to anybody
else no i
no i
you know
i think that the bar in this world is
actually very low
the number of individuals in any domain
who are searching for the truth
is
so minuscule
that it is almost practically
non-existent
um
and in a in a more worldly example you
know
i think in the last podcast i think you
would ask me something along the lines
of you know wouldn't it be great if
i don't remember the exact thing but if
everyone
uh you know was the type that went all
out to get something and my answer was
no it wouldn't be
because
that actually
allows for the person
who is actually willing to go even a
little bit all in
to
jump miles ahead everybody else like
everybody else right so
uh
so so the bar is actually very low
um everyone is basically in the same
place and when someone has even a little
bit of authenticity
even a little bit of sincerity even a
little bit of true desire to know the
truth about one's domain
completely jettisoning
the status quo
then
he becomes a superstar
so
comparison with others
you're really comparing
against people that you shouldn't be
comparing against
now you know
you're you're almost you're almost
begging for a regression
so i don't think anybody should compare
against
anybody i think that
uh competition is the road to mediocrity
but couldn't we all learn something from
people who are that miniscule top that
you're talking about
um
i think
i i i think that's a very theoretical
thing that couldn't we learn something
nobody really wants to be forced into
learning anything
if someone wants to learn something or
if someone is moved by something
then it was something within them that
caused them to either want to learn or
to be moved
but i don't think it's of any relevance
to say um to
to the to the public or to any
people
shouldn't you learn something from that
i think that's totally irrelevant
no nobody wants to learn if they don't
want to learn and telling them that they
should learn
is disingenuous because it will fall
upon deaf ears but what if i do want to
learn and let me give you a specific
example let's take
a younger and younger i'm just talking
about in tenure a young person who has
become a ceo or senior executive of a
fast growing company
is it is it does it serve her or him
well
to have experienced mentors
who have been in his or her shoes and
have built and continually grown
companies like he or she is building
that's a good question um
i think there are definitely
some tricks of the trade
some
some practical
things
that are beyond
books and journals and
um
schools
and a real practical level things that
one could in fact learn from someone
who's been there there is no doubt
um
the problem is
that if we look at the entire picture
no one will really stay in their own
lane in other words if you have quote a
mentor which i i
no i don't really
i don't really subscribe to mentors
but
imagine that you had a mentor and that
mentor had
12 really
really poignant things and there were
very small and quick little things that
they could teach you that were of
incredible practical value
now if you could be absolutely certain
that that mentor would give you those 12
little things
that you could implement and and that
might save you some years
and save you some money and save you
headache in your business
um then that is that's perfectly uh i
think helpful and beneficial
but
what will invariably happen
is that once those 12 things or along
with those 12 things
will be
a culture
that will be
fed into you by that mentor
you will be you will be subject to his
recycled experiences and so he will not
stay within the domain
of
of those 12 little things
he will
he will invariably
go into well this is my philosophy and
this is my x y and z and
he will never stay within those 12
things and so therefore in my opinion
i think that
that
mentors
bring about
i think in many ways
more detriment than benefit
because
they will not be able to be so
perfectly disciplined as to give you
only what you need without giving you
anything extra
so if i'm that person
and i have a board of directors and i
have a board of advisors each has a role
how do you recommend that i get the best
out of that group
and so if you're
if you're semi forced
to
to be subject
to the input of those people
then i think the most practical thing
would be
so as not to ruffle feathers and just
so that you can actually remain
independent while appearing to play to
be playing the game is to listen to what
you want to listen to and take from it
what you think will be a benefit to you
knowing full well that the entire time
the vast majority of what you will be
hearing will be recycled information
that will not be unique
that will be very derivative that will
be very status quo and if from that
as long as you have
your tentacles on
in your
your your filter is on full blast okay
it's wide open then there might be one
or two things that you learn and take
away and put into your pocket and
everything else you can ignore
but i but i but i don't i i just don't
i j on the whole i don't subscribe to
the idea
you know
you know my father told me a long time
ago
when you buy a used car
you're buying someone else's problems
and i think mentors are used cars
i think mentors have done whatever work
if you have a a superstar
and who wants to be your mentor or who
or you have asked them to be a mentor
that superstar did not get there by way
of technique
or mentorship
okay that superstar had found things
that
um by some alchemy worked for them
that's why i think it's a waste of time
to follow warren buffett it's totally
it's such a joke
no one should ever be following these
people these people do you think that
they're going to come out and tell you
all of their secrets it is so it is so
silly right so
these people
are tend to be very introspective
individuals they tend to be uh
individuals who truly want to know what
others don't know and they devote their
lives or their craft in order to learn
it they don't operate by way of
mentorship tips and tricks right so
so i totally agree with you on that i
totally agree with you yeah
so that's why i don't believe in mentors
i think that i think that true
originality
is only given the proper space and the
soil to grow
when you are not bound by someone else's
experiences and input
when you do not know what you aren't
supposed to know
that's when you can create i think i
think being naive and innocent is a
massive advantage
so if i'm not if i'm not learning from
the warren buffets of the world and i do
totally subscribe to
your the key point that you made there
is of are they going to really tell you
their trade secrets
maybe a
tiny component of it right but they're
not going to get into the details i'm
with you on that
but if if one of those individuals is
somebody who has a direct interest in my
success meaning that person is on my
board of directors
do you still feel they won't re help me
in a way
maybe sharing with me things that they
ordinarily wouldn't share with others
well
you know you are asked you are asking a
question through a particular lens
you are asking what that lens is
because there are people right now well
there are several positions well that
that lens is real
from one
perspective you are only seeing the
quote positive side i hate that but
positive side which is you are only
seeing the side that might provide you
benefit you are not seeing the side that
might provide you detriment
so the only lens to which you're looking
at it is i might get some information
that might be useful and is that true
yes it is
and so why would anyone be against
gaining useful information well nobody
in the right mind would be
so what i am saying is
that along with that useful information
oftentimes you'll be handcuffed because
you'll be then getting the experiences
that that person went through which may
not
be your experiences that that person may
have been living in a different time or
that meant the person may have had
different
interactions with different people
there are so many things you see i i
look at things from the standpoint of
what the ultimate possibility is
and that ultimate possibility i think is
far more related to
innocence and freshness
and
starting from scratch
than it is from
following in someone else's footsteps
when was the last time
you said to yourself after observing
someone
that that person
is truly elite
miyamoto musashi
okay inspirational
what what caused you what i mean and
then what
what
what was revealed oh a total confluence
of a total confluence of dna i mean here
we have an individual
you know he who leaves his house at the
age of 13. and he goes into the jungle
and he eats berries and drinks water
from the river and day and night he
studies the mind and he studies the
craft of swordsmanship and then he posts
um
signs in the local uh in the local
sort of provinces and say i challenge
the the greatest swords than in this
province
and he steps out of this vagabond
individual in front of the guy who he
challenges who's fully dressed from head
to toe in sort of princely robes right
and he comes in this wild hair you know
unkept you know hungry and emaciated
that individual and never loses a fight
i mean total and utter devotion to craft
with a complete and utter disrespect and
dismissal for the status quo
genius
what is it what it what does it take
the ordinary person
to get to that level of
minds i i don't care about ordinary
people
what does it take to be extraordinary
ordinary people go nowhere and i think
it is completely irrelevant
to talk about ordinary people it is
scraping the bottom of the barrel the
masses go nowhere it is irrelevant
talking about them and this is a society
which caters to the lowest common
denominator and that is why it creates
greater numbers of lowest common
denominators when it frankly could be
doing the opposite
and i totally agree with you so what
would you call
somebody who is
let's assume it's an extraordinary
person that you
know or work with
right what does it take to get to that
level of mind strength and a lot of
people ask you know
wha wouldn't you say it i don't think i
don't immersion
i don't think that's effective though i
think the question would be
the opposite
i don't think it's about
what does it take for this person to get
there i think the real question is
the people who have
the dna
to already be close to that
who are sensitive to that
who are sympathetic to that
how do those people not become
[Music]
ruined
by
a
mediocre
culture and society
which will drag them down
that is the question
it isn't the opposite
and what's it take
permission
that we each give ourselves
no that the individual
who
lives on the fringes of society
who is brilliant in his domain
who has never really fit in
who has always felt like this world was
not really his home
who
does not quite mingle in society
who has no interest in socialization
who is completely devoted to his craft
and yet at every turn is being told that
he needs to be more
sort of moderate in his views
that person is searching for permission
that precisely
the way in which he is
as wild as he is
is precisely where he should be
and that individual needs to be given
the permission
that it is not only okay
but it but your way of being should
actually be celebrated
and do not allow yourself to succumb
to the status quo
of this filth that we call society
so is that a life of constant
experimentation
is that all you do every day
just that every day there's an
experiment you're you're you're
experimenting
in a fashion to get closer to that
mental depth and and that mental
framework that you're describing
i would say that every single day
i am
in a journey to completely divorce
myself
from any inputs from my mind
and when when that inner critic
never shuts up
what type of conversations are going on
in your mind when when that continuous
well that's on repeat that hey
you're not good enough or you're not
going to get to this level or you ought
to do what this other person's doing do
you ever have those
no those things don't come up anymore
um
you know
the content of what the mind says is
largely irrelevant
my point is just to not have it talk at
all
and what's your advice to dealing with
setbacks when somebody starts to live
their life like that
right and they get
a crisis comes up
and they have a real hard time in
handling it or she has a real hard time
in handling it
what advice do you have for them in that
hard hour
you know i don't think it's about advice
i think that the reason
that
uh failure poses problems
is because
the viewpoint from which we view the
game
is fundamentally flawed
so i don't think it's like coming in
on the back end
and trying to pick up the pieces
because if you do that i mean the pieces
are going to fall apart again
so you're only
you're only putting the pieces together
with scotch tape
so that's irrelevant
so the real question becomes
not well what advice do you have to
help someone get through it
it doesn't matter if they get through it
because if they get through this then
there's going to be another assault
coming very soon isn't this is not going
to be the last assault
right so the question is that if you
know that an assembly line of assaults
are coming
then what is it
what is the frame what is the
understanding
what is the lens through which you are
viewing the game
that is causing you consternation when
things do not go
the way in which you
hope that they should
and for you what is that what does that
look like
you are too interested in answers
um what do you mean what does it look
like like i i mean you've had some
challenges
and i assume recently you've had some
things
turn out not the way you wanted them
how do you how have you dealt with them
it's not it's not really about answers
as a just
people want to know
well i don't think it's about how do i
deal with them i think i think it's
about um
it is yet another example
it is another
um
sort of
you know notch in the wall so to speak
of just how unsatisfying life
really is
um
life
and
the journey of a worldly slash domestic
existence
um
if that is
the
the lens through which life is lived
there is a constant struggle
in order to achieve a sense of
satisfaction
and
and so
that compels one to chase pleasurable
experiences or chase success
or chase you know various forms of
feathers in the cat
in order to give oneself a greater
self image going back to what you asked
earlier self-worth in hopes of
arriving at some form of
satisfaction um but that never lasts
so
i think the the more
setbacks and
quote failures and
uh
and dramas and conflicts you know
they
they just
for the person who is looking at them as
such will you know just sort of
underscore
um that you know
it it drills home the point
that
buddha was right
life indeed is suffering
there is no question about it
and that is not in any way
spiritual mystical religious or
theoretical
but does that mean when you say life is
suffering i get
where that's coming from
and i also get that there are
challenges that we're all going to deal
with every day
but if life's that miserable
what the hell do we celebrate
i don't know why anyone celebrates
anything
i celebrate nothing
i truly don't
um
if something good happens
i don't celebrate it you know
there should be there should be about
three people listening to this podcast
all right because everyone else
is
is going to consider these to be
um dark
and negative and nihilistic and
defeatist and um
insanely radical
absolutely okay so so even the question
that you asked i mean i i was going to
interject but i allow you to finish the
question you know you said we you know
even though that we know life is
suffering i know that a butt is coming
all right you know
there there is
there is only suffering
and there is only
there is only misery there really is no
and the
the reason that is is because nothing
lie
nothing wrong
if
if you were a person who was in love
with uh
cars right
and
every day
i brought you a new sports car
but then every other day i took it away
you would not look at that as a positive
experience totally get it sure
okay and that is exactly how life is so
i don't sugarcoat things okay i say
things the way they are i have no
interest in making anyone happy or sad
so when life is suffering does that mean
that you go and sit in the room and cry
all day long you can
but
the only reason that it won't benefit
you is because even when you stop crying
it'll still be suffering
so
there's no point
right
so i think it is the stark understanding
that no matter what you do in this world
mo
whether you raise children
whether you build a
20 billion dollar company
whether you become a famous
professional athlete
at the end of the day
every human being
ends up in the same place
they end up alone in their house
with the lights dimmed
wondering
when the satisfaction is going to arrive
and it doesn't matter how big the bank
account is
fundamentally
everyone reverts to the foundation of
what comes next
because none of these things last
and you do not need to believe a single
word that i say
i don't even subscribe to belief
you just have to open your eyes and look
and i totally get where you're coming
from
and at the same time we're talking to an
audience who are building and growing
companies
so in the hallway of these companies
how can a message like that be
inspirational to people who every day i
go in this company or in these open
these doors as a leader
to want to inspire a group of people to
do great things
yeah
um
that's a very very good question
so what i will say is that
there's a great benefit
in seeing the truth
but if the truth is seen for the benefit
then it becomes an ulterior motive and
it doesn't get anyone anywhere
but there just so happens to be an
organic benefit
of seeing the truth and if someone
realizes for instance no matter what
someone does in their life they will
never arrive at a place of satisfaction
that will last
then
what will happen is that
they will become free
and the reason they'll become free
is
that they will not tie
any sense of hope
or
anticipation
of
happiness or self-worth to what they are
doing
they will be free to create and to do
whatever they wish to do
completely unbound
by
the hope of success
or the fear of failure
now this is not why i am saying that one
should recognize that life is suffering
and that there is no satisfaction and
that seeking the truth um is the only
way i am not saying that to do those
things in order to provide in order to
come at this benefit i'm saying that
those things are all true in their own
right
it just so happens
that
seeing those truths
organically provides one the benefit
of freedom which ironically
is precisely what everyone is seeking to
begin with
so when you're a leader
and you've got a group of people who are
struggling to
make investors happy you know what let's
use an actual example over the last
couple of days apple has been
bombarded by negative press
their stock has taken a hit every
article you're reading is about
what went wrong you know what did their
ceo tim cook
miss or what are they misleading the
world from if you're sitting in that
boardroom right now
seeing that your stock took over a 40
hit over the last three or four months
how are you dealing with it what are you
saying to the other leaders sitting
across from you to say
hey this is that we got to deal
with and here are some things we're
going to do to move beyond it
no i'm not on my interest in putting out
fires
um listen you know
you can't do all the detrimental things
and then on the other side they will
give me a tip to get out of this mud tip
and things don't work that way
okay so the truth is and i'm not asking
you for a tip um
tell me what that conversation's like
okay
okay well first of all the conversation
is who am i dealing with are these
individuals who truly are looking for
tips and for a lifeline and if they are
assuming they're not
they're not okay so if they're not so if
they're not what i'll say is that the
reason that you're okay so where their
stock goes up and down those things are
part of business okay so that is the
real question
your problem isn't that the stock is
going down that isn't your problem
you're in problem your problem your
immediate most acute problem is the
negative emotional impact that is having
upon you absolutely that's your issue
because because one thing i will promise
you that if that stock plummeted and you
were unaffected
you wouldn't you would be on fire right
you would do whatever you needed to do
to correct whatever issues needed to be
correct and you would take action where
action needed to be taken and that's
fine you wouldn't sit at home that's
fine but internally you wouldn't be
feeling it so the question becomes what
is it that is causing you all this
emotional turmoil and what's causing you
the emotional turmoil is that the lens
through which you view this is a faulty
lens and the lens through which you view
this should not be one of attachment
but one of the game
because you didn't view it as a game
that is kept at arm's length at all
times
then you became attached to it so
naturally
you are going to suffer highs and lows
and you will you're going to be like a
tin can who is that is tied with a rope
behind the bumper of a car and wherever
that car goes whatever bump in the road
it feels you're gonna feel and that's
the natural result of it
and i i that was beautifully said
all right that was beautifully said and
again i want to assume that the people
in that room are your kind of people
they're the ones that want to be
superb and they're the ones maybe who
were going to say you know screw the
outside world we're doing our own thing
what am i doing to make sure that that
constant barrage externally isn't
impacting the type of business we're
building
well it's not about the garage
it's about it's not about
it's not about the rain it's the quality
of the umbrella
so i'm totally ignoring it
in terms of um
ignoring the noise
right
well that that you're you're when you
say ignoring it
you may be forcefully ignoring it and
gritting your teeth and that would
get you anywhere either
so you can't actively ignore something
if you if you genuinely are impacted by
it especially for a public company
yeah i
everything is irrelevant nothing has any
significance okay if your company if
your company goes up in smoke it goes up
in smoke
right i'm telling you the ultimate
business person the ultimate athlete the
ultimate
individual in any domain is the one who
is first and foremost
free
that comes success or come failure
it is what it is
and the person will once again do
whatever needs to be done over here and
do whatever needs to be done over here
but
internally he is unaffected and the
reason he is unaffected
is because he views it as a game
and he knew at the outset
that this could this this thing could
become this this massive massive you
know beacon for humanity
or
it could go up in smoke
all right so if i am viewing it as a
game what is considered what is
considered a win and what is considered
a loss
although i set any goals
and and no those those are your own
definitions i mean for some person for
some people you know uh
why they go into it is a very personal
thing for some it's just the you know
the expression of you know their talent
for someone else it's you know it's the
game of making you know 10 billion
dollars for someone else it's the game
of being how big of a company i can
create there's no right or wrong so
those are completely personal
definitions as to why one gets into it
and what one is truly seeking from it
but the one thing that i will say
is
that
one litmus test if it is
ultimate satisfaction regardless of
outcome then that person will not go
astray
what does freedom look like
you know i was asked this question so
many in the world are from the pga tour
right because there's a question well
do you know anybody who
you know any tour pro who you've used
golf that way
my question is always my answer's always
the same
do you know anybody who's tried
no one
how can you expect
anyone
to look at things from these you know
from this
other worldly
you know mystical almost
um anti-societal
lenses
when
the only thing that
the person has ever been taught or been
exposed
or that has been
basically
shoved into down his throat and into his
brain has been the opposite you can't
really ask that question why would they
if all that you've taught someone is x
and wherever that person goes he sees
posters of text and whatever he listens
to he hears x and whoever he talks to he
is told at
how can you ask the question which is
well how many people do you know who
think why
why would they think why
they would only think why if there was
other option right if if if they had
other options no one is given another
option nothing else exists but x nothing
else exists but prescriptions nothing
else exists but societal tenants and
and you know fabricated rules and all of
all of this silliness
it's all that exists so what else are
you going to create on a daily basis
what are you going to spawn but that
do you think that type of mindset can
help fuel a company to that level of
greatness i could see the pursuit of one
individual like yourself
how would that translate
to if kapil gupta was building a company
that has thousands of people how do i
infect an organization with a message
like that
and a way of living like that
by being uncompromising
human beings will take
if you give a human being an inch he
will take a mile
and if you if you
structure things in an airtight fashion
then you will tend to attract those who
are moved by that philosophy
but the moment you compromise
the moment you crack open the door
you're finished and compromise on
what compromise on on your vision
compromise on what you believe to be
purity
and if if come what may if it were you
how would you articulate your vision to
the thousands of people who work for you
well whatever the ultimate freedom
whatever
well i mean that would be related to i
mean what do you mean in the making of a
company yeah let's say you're building a
company
okay so without making the company then
i would figure out why it is that i'm
making the company in the first place
what does satisfaction look like to me
right what what are my non-negotiables
so so those are the those
you know would be my viewpoints those
would be the lenses you know through
which i would i would do things and then
once i had my own
those that were the things that were
non-negotiable to me
then
whoever would be hired
whoever would i would be surrounded by
would be individuals who were airtight
in those non-negotiables
i wouldn't be interested in convincing
anybody
so you become because you
when you have an airtight vision
you cannot
allow
your mind to be exposed
to views that are contrary and inferior
to your vision because those things will
sabotage you
that's why on twitter i mute and block
people all the time
because it isn't a form of retaliation
it is that i can't have that in my space
everything the eyes see
and everything that my mind is exposed
to
must be
chosen
it must be
it must be precise
it must be in keeping with the vision
because the one thing that i am
completely and utterly
cognizant and acutely aware
is the danger of culture
the danger of environment
do you know the number of individuals
who in this world who were born to be
great
but they were almost killed in the womb
by this society
and they will never even know
that
that they were supposed to be great
this is the power
of environment and culture
the greatest individual will shun the
world
he will live as an isolationist he will
be a hermit
because he cannot afford
association
i i i i'm totally in agreement with you
i'm totally in agreement with you there
and i i can see how we're all infected
by the energy of others but you you know
that i'm going to ask this question
what are your non-negotiables
in what in life
in your life right now what are your
non-negotiables
uh
arriving at
complete and total freedom from the mind
and does that dictate everything
for me
from a societal perspective
um
no ingested substances of any kind
ever
ever in my life i've never had dr i've
never had
a drop of alcohol in my life i've never
taken a
uh a drug in my life i've never smoked
in my life
i you know obviously have to take
tylenol and you know cough medicine and
those kind of things um and some
antibiotics but um
those
you know i live a very
i live a very hermetic existence
i don't
i mean i go out
but
quietly
all right two more things for you
i really love this idea of approaching a
business
with this notion of non-negotiables
we've heard it before but i don't think
within this context there's a lot of
companies that are built on solving big
problems right first person that comes
to mind that's solving big problems is
elon musk
if you're standing in those shoes and
you really i want to take people to the
moon i want to build an electric car
that's going to change the entire face
of an industry
how do you think about these problems
you know i i wonder i don't i mean
perhaps
you know you know
elon musk has uh
you know very rare dna
so a person who has rare dna in one
domain you know probably is already
doing some of these things right he may
already be viewing things from
from from these lenses um i wouldn't be
surprised
but but i think elon musk is a perfect
example of an individual who i would say
needs to be
um very cognizant of the fact that you
know because he is an outlier with
regard to levels of success and
uh
you know
you know being very original and
imaginative
and not uh you know not placing himself
and combining himself to societal limits
um
that he needs to be very cognizant of
the fact that this society is a is a as
a you know a poisonous swarm
that through various
different uh avenues
could serve to
derail his gargantuan efforts so i think
it's largely those types of individuals
i think it's largely about protecting
oneself and to keeping oneself pure to
one's dishes because
um through through all through you know
if the window is cracked open
you know
that poisonous gas is coming to the
window
right so i would say that
the maintenance of the purity of one's
vision without the slightest form of
compromise
is what must be kept intact
and how do you maintain a level of calm
when you're dealing with
such monumental problems
what are you doing to make sure that you
don't let doubt overshadow the level of
confidence you need to keep pursuing
these audacious goals
well doubt oftentimes comes from society
so i think that's
perfectly in line with what but we
internalize it most of us at least most
of most of us humans internalize it
well that's because
most humans value society
so if you value someone
or something
then you're going to random ear to it
if you if you think that something is uh
is baseless or that a person
that whenever that person speaks
the person speaks
you know nonsense
and uh is
you know
then you would not listen to that person
so it's because people place value upon
society
that they allow it in
that's why it's it's of no in it it's
it's irrelevant to tell someone
well don't listen to people don't don't
let them you know don't let the world
you know
you know bring you down
that can't happen
unless that person
has
no respect for the world
and it's hard as hell to think like that
right like i totally concur with your
thinking that there is tremendous conf
tremendous comfort in
being mediocre
right or whatever however you wanted to
find it being average or
being part of the study there's
tremendous comfort in that it takes
real responsibility for somebody to
accept
that being great is a responsibility
and they're very few people who want to
go there
i don't think being great the
responsibility
you don't why is it a responsibility no
why is being greater who are you being
responsible to yourself
you don't owe yourself anything
if you're great that's because you have
it's because you have no choice
it's not a it's not you know i have a
responsibility to do this and that i
have responsibility to myself no it's
you do it because you have no choice
that's just where all of your
inclinations
and your energy goes
it didn't ever ask your opinion
why wouldn't i want to be great
well why wouldn't someone want a billion
dollars you know delivered in uh
10 silver suitcases lined up in a
horizontal fashion on their doorstep
tomorrow line it up why would they
well of course they would okay well
things don't but but want
is irrelevant right
yeah one is irrelevant it's the pursuit
or whatever however you want to define
it
well yeah so so what i'll say is
you know
you know i don't know why
i turned out the way i turned out
okay i don't know why um the one thing
i'll tell you to answer your question
yeah yes it is difficult
for someone to think like this
and but the reason is difficult is
because they would be doing it
in order to make in a way that to make
themselves think like this right
i mean i never tried to make myself
think like this no one ever told me i
never followed anybody i wasn't mentored
into it right
i've always hated society right so
so i think was there a point for you
when you knew
what however you want to frame it
right that you were just cut out of a
different cloth and you were just going
to follow a different path was there a
thing that triggered that for you
no i you know
like if i if i go back and examine
um
oftentimes it isn't what you do it's
what you find yourself doing
and so if i was to go back and examine
i've always been a loner i'm an only
child right i've always done things
alone like you know i've always got out
to eat alone and whenever i would go out
to eat i you know i never had any
interest in going with other people um
i've always been a writer i've
i've never been interested in the social
scene
i've
i've always asked questions that were
felt that were thought of as uh you know
crazy and wild and
uh you know
just totally different right
so
no i mean there was no event there was
no event it was it's just sort of always
been that way and you and you learn that
as you become an adult and you look
backwards and you find that the seeds of
being this way were sown at a very young
age and they weren't sown by anybody
they were just
dna
so that's why i think a lot of these
things about self-improvement and
self-development are really disingenuous
because you can't really make yourself
what you're not
right so
how you know
this i think it's i think you you have
to work from a place where you genuinely
are
um
and
and if something really really resonates
with you
then
you naturally will begin to
move in that direction
without actually making a choice because
the thing resonated with you so much
i can speak for people who are listening
and tell you that there is a
whole lot of us who want to achieve that
level of freedom from our minds
and
that's
whether you call it a prescription or
not for for
the majority of the people who i've
interacted with who listen to these
podcasts or our conversations
that is the singular issue we want
freedom from our minds
and every time we listen to you we get a
we get something
that help us realize
maybe this is what i need to take away
or maybe this isn't you know this is how
i should start to think in order to do
that
that's a worthy pursuit
well
i will happily disagree with you
i don't think that people want freedom
from their minds
i think it's a tasty notion
when they're being tormented
and when they're not being tormented
they want freedom to watch television
they want freedom to follow politics
they want freedom to complain about the
president
they want freedom to go to local mike
club
okay
so
human beings
are our fair weather fans
they are they are bandwagon jumpers
they are situational creatures
the number of people
who truly want freedom from their mind
i can probably count on one hand
who exists
you know
in
maybe you know
in the west side right
yeah okay right so
so people want the benefit of the thing
they don't they don't they don't want
the totality of things
so if i told someone well in order to
get freedom from your mind
you're going to have to give away the
good as well as the bad no no thank you
i don't want that
i only want to give away the back
i only want to give away the negative
feelings and the sadness and the sorrow
and i want to keep the happiness the joy
well
sadness and sorrow and joy are two sides
of the same coin
right so no one wants freedom from the
mind
well i do let me go on record on saying
that i do maybe i haven't quite grasped
the level that you're talking about
but
that is the singular thing
that to me
distinguishes you from everybody else
that's out there that that is
your genuine
objective
and if we can all just get captured 10
of that
i'm convinced that we'd all be better
off
okay
so before we sign off i know you don't
watch tv you don't pay attention to
sports but something interesting
happened yesterday that i just want to
get your perspective on
there's a kicker who missed a
relatively short game-winning field goal
yesterday
for the bears to knock him out of the
playoffs he's a young kid who's had
horrible luck
and obviously the world of twitter and
the world of of of broadcasters or all
over the kid what do you say to somebody
like that
i have no interest in making i have no
interest in making no interest in making
them feel better
i would say to him listen do you really
want
do you really want to arrive at the
truth and arrive at the place where you
are unaffected by success or failure
which by the way will help you
arrive at your ultimate performances
probably more often than anybody else in
the nsl
and the answer is that and if the answer
to that is yes then i will say okay well
then i don't care how you feel right now
let's scratch everything and look at the
lens through which you are viewing the
game and you are viewing the game from
the lens of
self-gratification versus
failure
right you are and and viewed through
that lens you will have failure far far
far more often than you will have
self-static self-gratification
so if that's the game you've already
lost you must as well go home you're not
going to win that game nobody wins that
game
so if if you want the truth
then the truth is
that arriving at the place where you are
unaffected by
success or a failure
and that you are not interested in
self-gratification because you know
that along with that self-gratification
will bring you ten times more
of
sorrow and failure
then
we can approach we can we can help you
approach the game by allowing you to
understand what the truth really is so
that you can view the game as a game
and that will allow you to be free
because it is only the one who has
everything that can actually play it is
only the one who was full
before he arrives
that asks nothing from the game and when
a human being
has no need
he is free and when he is free
he becomes untouchable
he becomes a legend
and on that note
the con the topic of our next we ended
our last conversation with you
saying
that it is only the ones who have
everything
that can actually play
because the one who is full before he
arrives
is the one that asks for nothing from
the game
and when a human being has no need
he is free and when he is free he
becomes untouchable
which leads to this whole idea of being
legendary
that you continue to talk about unpack
that for me a little bit
i think everyone looks at
their craft and
their sport and their business and
whatever their pursuit is as a place
from which to get something
it's sort of a wishing well of sorts
and that that creates a lot of problems
because
the field
the
you know the field of play
doesn't really have any power to give
anybody anything
so everyone you know tends to have
in general
a hole that they're trying to fill
and
that hole is filled
by
success or by wins or by money or by
status
whatever it may be
and
that that really creates an enormous
problem because then you're beholden to
the outcome
uh
to decide how it is that you feel about
yourself
so that means that how you feel about
yourself and what your state of
so-called happiness or joy and
peace whatever it is
is always in the hands of someone else
or something else and
that's really slavery
so
one of the things we've talked about in
the past is your ability to
let go of the outcome right to have the
mindset that to approach
any endeavor
with
having the outcome being a byproduct of
the pursuit
it's tough as hell to get to that
especially when you got a lot writing on
the line whether you're in sports or in
business
where do you start
to get to that level
well it's tough to get
it's tough to get to that if you are
viewing it as a prescription
it's not so tough to get to that
if you
come to the conclusion that you have no
other choice
everything is tough when it's a view
from from the standpoint of a
prescription
it's not only tough it's virtually
impossible
because you're doing it because of a
should
and you know
if you know
you you might be able to give away
some second-hand clothing
uh
by way of a should
but
you're not going to give away the family
jewels by way of should
so
for you to give away the family jewels
you must see no other option
you're not going to do it because it's
good for you or because
the rule book says that you should
let's not assume it's a prescription
right let's assume but it has to be it
has to be though if it's if if it's that
difficult
then it is being pursued from
the lens of
this is what i
should do and this is what i'm supposed
to do and this is what i've been told
it's a good idea because it may benefit
me down the road and
this is a good habit to get into
and those are very cosmetic things those
don't have the power
to uh allow someone to give away the
family jewels
for someone to let go you know this this
is all like sports psychology you know
you know really just hot air you know
you know be in the present and you know
give you know
um
forget about the outcome let's go
and
what what no one seems to understand is
that
the only reason that you're being told
that
is because it's an ulterior motive to
help you play better
so it's all it's all a trick
and the mind recognizes that trick
so it's just an ulterior motive it's
just it's just an avenue to get
somewhere it's a means to an end and
because it's a means to an end it has no
power
it isn't done genuinely it isn't done
because the person arrived there and and
discovered that if i don't do it there
is incredible ruin
and that ruin is not something that i've
been told about that theoretically may
occur in the future i'd experience that
really i've experienced how my life is
completely in shambles
when
the outcome of a tournament
uh dictates how i look and feel about my
life and my profession so
everything has to be genuine
you can't come at it
through prescriptive means
so i think that's why it's difficult
isn't just difficult it's like i said
it's virtually impossible
so none of us are immune
to the feeling of elation when we've
succeeded
at the same time
none of us are immune to the fear of
failure
right we're not in your head space yet
you know if a business fails
i mean unless you're yoda you probably
feel really bad about it do you want
that feeling are you referring to that
feeling when that feeling gets so bad
is is that where i have to go in order
to be able to get to that level of
uh
mindshare where i don't give a damn
about the outcome anymore and
with that
i am on a path
that
to that legendary status that you're
talking about
you know
no one ever looks at where they are
because they're so busy looking at where
they should be
so
no one ever looks
to see
what are the consequences of
the way that i view things
what what are the consequences that i've
all not that i will experience
but that i've already experienced
i mean everyone's into looking at the
results of whether the outcome of the
game or the business turned out well
what about the results of
the way in which you've been looking at
the game what about those what about the
consequences not of the game but what
about the consequences of the way that
you've been looking at
so
so you you know you talk about well if
the business fails and the person feels
bad
well that isn't the first time that they
felt dejected
they've been feeling dejected the entire
time
it wasn't just when it failed
when it failed they felt the dejection
of failure but all along they've been
feeling the dejection of fear
so why is it that no one was looking at
that why is no one looking at the fact
that why is everyone looking at the
dramatic climax
why are they not looking and saying
but you know for the last 20 years
i've lived in fear and anxiety
so that's already happened
that isn't something that's going to
happen
that's where the person has been living
so why not look at that outcome
and say well why is it that i've been
living in fear and anxiety for all these
years
and then ask that question and then that
will take a person to
the place where he's seen well i've been
living in fear and anxiety because the
way in which i've been looking at the
game is completely detrimental
um to
how i feel
it's it's not sustainable
that is the road of truth
not
not you know the
the hysteria over
how can a person lose its company and
still not be dejected
forget that question
look at what a person already is
now
your question would be valid if you said
for the last 20 years that i've been
building a company
and i've been joyful and peaceful the
entire time and when the company failed
then i became
ejected and that was the first time only
when it failed i would say fine because
that's a valid question but that isn't
happening
everyone's distraught
from beginning to end
so why not examine the level of
distraughtness
that the person's been swimming in for
years
no one's looking at that
i totally agree with you right and i
want to come back to that in a moment
but you triggered something in me
because one of the great insights
that i have learned from you and that
you provided me is this idea of access
and you brought it up in one of your
last
podcasts where you talked about hey
these people who you consider elite they
don't have a problem with acquiring new
knowledge or new skills
what gets in the way is accessing those
skills
so is is that what you're talking about
here with the ability to be able to
access that by asking myself that
question
no i mean that that's different i mean
you don't have to access it maybe when
you ask yourself the question
it's just the nature of the question i
mean instead of asking the question why
how can i not feel dejected when a
company fails rather than rather than
asking that question ask the question
why do i feel dejected already all along
that's the question so as for skill
acquisition versus skill action that's a
question of performance
so when someone is performing well
the performance community and the
coaches and the sports psychologists and
the business coaches and the
motivational speakers and whoever it is
they're all talking they're all saying
the same too they're all well
they're all talking from the standpoint
of well you have to go back and work on
your technique and you have to work
harder and you have to improve your
skill and well if that okay let's once
again look at the evidence if that was
the case
then they would never play well
right if it was a question of skill
acquisition
then they wouldn't have one great game
and then pretty bad game
where would the great game come from if
if this skill wasn't fair
if it hadn't been acquired would the
great he shouldn't have any great
but that isn't the case
they'll have great games and they'll
have a bunch of lousy games
so
so that means so according to that logic
when the person had the great games
the skill was there
and then when they had lousy games
the skill disappeared and now they have
to go back and learn the technique all
over again
or re-learn
wow you re-learn i mean do you reload
time your shoes
if you've been doing something for 25
years you have to relearn it
when just last week you performed
fantastic
so so between last wednesday and today
you lost the skill like you were walking
down the street and
just it just
it just
drifted out of it well don't you believe
do you believe in complacency that at
some point success becomes more of a
curse
that's a different question
i'm talking about where did that feel go
between last wednesday and
then today
i'm sure it's still there
all right
it's a matter of me recalling it or
accessing it like you're talking about
right that's my point so the skill is
still there it hasn't gone anywhere
so if the skill is still there why is
everyone working on
[Music]
acquiring the skill again or acquiring
more skill why is that the question that
is being asked that doesn't make any
sense to me
so what's the question that you're
asking
why is it that i'm not able to access it
and what often gets in the way
i know it's personal
everything but technique
you know so
so let's you know
let's uh
if the bleeding's in the head you know
we'll get to what part of the head the
bleeding's in but can we first move away
from the leg sure
right so if everyone's already
if everyone's already going back to the
coach
or to the
you know to the business guru or
whatever it is
what do i have to do and what's my five
step plan the business guru right
because the business guru has all the
answers
well the business grew with all the
prescriptions
and we all fall for it it sells books
yeah well well not only fall people ask
for it
so
so no one really gets anywhere
this is all just a scam
everything and everything in this
society
is a scam
from the government to the fda
to
sports coaching
to
uh business coaching
it's it's all of course
there's nothing real here it's just
swirling muddy water because no it has
nothing to do with intelligence there's
nothing to do with people not being
smart enough there's nothing nothing
whatsoever to do with that
it's no one's interested in asking the
effective questions the real questions
the questions that actually get someone
somewhere
because everyone's interested in working
on stuff all the time
everyone's interested in practice and
everyone's interested in
uh you know following sort of the
guidelines of what to do and what you
should do and
everyone's got a you know technical
instructor and everything
it's it's cheap following sheet
so help me drill down a little bit then
help me drill a little bit deeper
from
that purity aspect that you talk about
just in general
what is it that we can start to do
to try to get closer to getting away
from these prescriptions and focusing on
the real truth that will enable us to be
more successful to achieve greater
heights to be happier whatever it is
that you will ultimately define as
legendary
um i think i don't think it has anything
to do with what you need to do
but that will be another prescription
i think it has everything to do with the
idea that to ask yourself if you're
really serious
and
to give yourself an honest answer
and it's a very honest answer to say
that i'm not serious
the truth is
very very few people are serious
right we started off with three and then
we like last time we said five so
there's five five people
on the planet now and i hope i'm one of
them
uh okay so for those five people
um if they're really serious then i'll
say okay
just
please don't believe anything that i say
um
because i don't believe anybody so i'm
don't ask anyone to believe me but kapil
we do believe that
but that's that's
but just look at your own life look at
your own life i'll tell you the risk to
the five people
wherever they are in the world if
they're listening
look at your own life
and
um
examine honestly and innocently
all the prescriptions that you followed
in you know for purposes of your life
and well-being
and
your business and your profession
whatever it may be
and
uh see where it's gotten you
see if it's see if it has gotten you to
an arrival see if it has gotten you to a
permanent state in which there are no
more questions
see if it has gotten you to a holy grail
see if it has gotten you to a place
where you don't need anymore how to
examine for yourself
that's that's my honest answer
for you i'm gonna answer this because if
you don't do that when you don't do that
then you then you won't then you won't
move genuinely in away from
prescriptions let me answer for the five
people starting with myself no of course
it hasn't gotten
the holy grail or
a level or state of permanence no of
course that's why okay i am
intrigued and incredibly appreciative of
the perspective that you bring to the
table
and so if that's the case
and it hasn't gotten you where you would
like it to get you
then you will naturally fundamentally
and organically
move away from prescriptions not because
i say so but because you have found for
yourself but it hasn't gotten you
anywhere
and as you move away from prescriptions
what will begin to happen is that your
questions will begin to change
they will fundamentally change
because now you're not looking through
the lens of a how-to anymore
because you have realized
not that you shouldn't
but but you because you have realized
that looking through that lens of how-to
doesn't work
and so when someone's questions begin to
change
then
the people
or the situations
that
may provide
the direction for that person
also begin to change
it's like a rubik's cube you change one
face
and all the faces change
what is the context of the questions
that
you started to ask yourself when you
started to sense that shift
you know my questions are more much more
along the lines of what is the source of
the
of the matter what is the one thing that
fixes twelve
as opposed to fixing twelve things right
um
what is the most fundamental truth
upon which all these problems exist that
fundamental truth was realized and
everything that was resting upon it
would fall away
well is that it's never in the realm of
the house too
yeah well i i think we all get that now
we definitely all get that but when you
look at these elite people or when you
look at these high achievers
the world looks and starts to say that
hey what distinguishes these individuals
from others is that it starts with
talent
however i'm continuing to be convinced
that really it isn't talent it's
upstairs like you say it's their mind or
their mindset
one is that true do you see that as the
fundamental thing that that
distinguishes these super elites that
you're talking about from the rest of
the world does it start with their mind
no it's not the talent
so it is so so you do agree again with
that
well but what distinguishes well my
agreement only goes so far
of course
the departure coming very very soon uh
so
um
[Music]
if you but if you look at
if you if you look at within
a population of elite like within a
professional
uh you know
basketball
arena or within
you know the world of professional
sports so there everyone's very very
talented okay
and so there what separates
one from the the the
super elite from the other elite
that mind
but what separates the whole because
your question was
what is that separates the elite from
the rest of the people
yeah but within that domain it's the
mind got it
so so take me to that space then what is
the mind like for those
that are in that
ultimately in that legendary state that
you're gonna talk about is it no mind
yeah
well
i would say it's dna
first and foremost i think some people
are just their sensibilities are
different
the things that they um
the things that attract them are
different
the things that they gravitate towards
are different
the places that they want to go
in terms of their vision for their
career is different
the way that they'll
do even things outside of their
profession will be different
now i and i and i think that i think
it's a mistake
to
start looking at these people and
following their habits
no i think that's just
i i'm so against all that stuff you know
the seven habits of effective people
that's just
it's just privilege well it's all it's
always the number seven for whatever
reason it's always
something yeah
yeah there's always you know
so it and no one should like try to be
that right
because i think there's talent within
everybody
um
but you know why is there one who's
super elite because his dna is different
but if i don't have that dna
do i not have a chance to get to that
level that you're talking about
what i'll say is that if you have if you
ask that question
that if a person wants to ask that
question that i don't have that dna but
i really want to get the very fact of
asking that question implies that he has
some semblance of that dna
because the people who truly don't have
that dna are too oblivious to even know
that they don't happen
because like i don't even know what this
dna that you're talking about is
well being a that's to be a legend i
want to be the greatest ever right i
want to be in the history books i want
to um you know where everyone wherever
everyone is and my craft i don't want
anyone near me right i don't want to you
know i want to walk my own path i don't
follow any rules i don't listen to
stupid coaches right i don't need all
this instruction right
they do everything against the grain
they're
they are
they are
um
they're heretics
right they're revolutionary
they're
that type of dna
do they not have goals
i mean don't you consider
so isn't that like i want to be the best
in my craft or i want to be you know the
greatest who does or you know have more
gold medals than anybody i mean do you
consider that a goal because i know
you're not
fond of goals
you know i mean you could retrofit
something and then say well is it can
you consider that a goal of me you know
my goals i mean i don't you know by this
time i want to accomplish this and by
this time i want to accomplish that
that's sort of what i mean i mean
um
but when someone wants to be a legend i
don't think it's less less of a goal
that's just who the person believes
himself to be
[Music]
that's what he feels like he was put on
this earth to be like it's almost his
birthright
so i mean that's so i don't
like i said you can you can turn any
english word into anything
okay
but i'm talking about it from the most
colloquial youth of the word gold
um
that's what i was talking about so one
when one of those people comes to you
to
be their coach advisor whatever you want
to call it and you agree to work with
them what's the first question you're
going to ask them
i have no idea what the first question
is i never know what i'm going to ask
anybody i have no idea
because i i've done a script i don't
know anything i mean just whatever comes
out comes out but what do you want to be
about
you know i will i will know who they are
by the questions they ask
will know who they are
by
um
if it's a face-to-face meeting
how
how still
and how
with what sort of look they look at me
when i speak
you you will pick up on all these cues
sure absolutely
that's when you know
that if someone is truly serious um or
this is not for them
were there some interesting questions
that you got asked recently that uh
distinguished some people who i never
remember it i don't remember anything i
don't know i don't know
oh i don't know
i just i mean
no those d i mean
i think i think it's far more beneficial
if you listen to sort of the flavor of
what i'm saying as opposed to looking
for the
you know
the detail of
you know the example
so what do you mean when you say you'll
find your own example so so talk to me a
little bit about
what you mean when you say performance
is never a goal it's always a byproduct
or a side effect
yeah
if your goal is i want to play better or
i want to perform better
that's not true your motive but that's a
natural goal that most of us pursue well
but that that'll that implies
that very that that very
tenant implies
that i should be doing something
some form of a doing
that'll improve my performance
and that never gets anyone to the top
sure it might improve your performance
and even then it but even if it improves
it today it'll probably
you know it'll be less improvement
tomorrow because the mind will figure
out an antidote to whatever your new
trick is
so
that's why every trick has a shelf life
that's why every red tail is followed by
a blue pill true absolutely
okay so it isn't about
how can i perform better
it is
about what are the problems
and what are the things that i have not
realized
that have hampered my performance
that's a fundamentally different
question
because one is
tell me what to do
give me some five step plan or some
stupid hack
that i could you know utilize to get
you know five percent better
and the other one is
the other one has the potential of
blowing the doors open
by way of understanding
so are you always competing against
yourself then is this always a
commitment
no no i don't compete i'm just
constantly looking for
the truth i'm constantly looking
that you know is the thing that i've
already found is that truly rock bottom
or is there another level
more fundamental than that
so what do you say then when what do you
mean when you say competitions for those
who've not mastered
and they're left with nothing but to
compete what is that what is that well
well the person who masters i mean
if you master
darts
and you could hit the bullseye every
time why would you compete
no one would you would have no
competition
you show up to a tournament you show up
to the olympics and you're not competing
you're just gonna go do your thing
well why would you
i mean from the outside someone could
say oh look he there's one person and
there's ten others they are competing i
guess you could say that
but but if you hit the bullseye every
single time
you don't have any competition
so internally competition
competition is for the people
who have not learned how to hit the
bull's eye every time
and they're getting together to compete
to see who can get closer
so competition
is like fighting over a half-eaten
sandwich
competition
is fundamentally for non-masters
so what am i what do masters do
masters master
they don't look to beat anybody
they don't want to better
anybody and it it isn't because that's
not nice
you know never go down that road
right i don't know about nice and good
and improper and everyone gets to you
know a trophy for playing and all that
silliness you know
it's
in my view
anything can be mastered
there is a way
to own it
and because that's my view
that will naturally be my pursuit
if my view was that competition is the
way
then naturally my pursuit would be to go
in practice and out practice the other
in hopes that i could get two percent
better than him
so
whatever your view is
that's what your pursuit will be
and that's why your view and
the your the lens to which you see
things has real consequences
so do you see the whole pursuit of
chasing
success in whatever shape or form
[Music]
a real problem for people who are
chasing it
yeah do we get just handcuffed by that
yeah because what they're chasing is
really the
fringe benefits of success
they're chasing how to better another
and
ironically
bettering another means that you
are limited by the other person
because you will only do just enough to
inch past him and once you have inched
past him you'll stop
so you'll never know how good you can be
[Music]
so competition breathes mediocrity
yeah i i live in that space i believe i
really
and and over the last year or so
you have convinced me of that so i'm i'm
there with you
at the same time i also realize that as
human beings
to get to that state that you're
describing that the five people really
really
want to get a glimpse at there has to be
an element of fear of letting go
everything that i've done in the past
that at least gave me a taste
of what success is like in order for me
to try to pursue
um you know maybe a more
appropriate or permanent way to live
uh in this state that you're talking
about fear is real
and it's hard to get rid of for a lot of
people
right and i assume that the people who
are at the level that you're describing
maybe are not immune to it but deal with
it differently
no i i i don't think there's a problem
i think what matters is what you're
afraid of that's the problem
see if you're afraid of not becoming the
success that's a problem
if you're afraid of not learning the
truth
that's not a problem
that's a very good problem to have
because whatever you're afraid of that's
what you're going to make sure doesn't
happen
so if you're if you're afraid of losing
and if you're afraid of
not becoming a success then you'll go
down the path of hard work and struggle
if you're afraid of not learning the
absolute truth
and that's what you're truly afraid of
that how good you could have been
then you'll go down the path of mastery
so the nature of your fear has
consequences
so do you measure progress how do you
measure progress
or do you
no i don't measure progress
i just measure what
did you get to where you want to go or
not
well in business if we've got these
super ambitious goals we may not ever
get there but we get closer is that
thumbs up
i don't think it's about the goal
i think it's where you believe yourself
to be
and what you believe your destiny is
what you believe to be your birthright
who you who you feel that you were on
this earth to be
i don't think it's about ghoul
so you you have talk of gold when you're
all these committees
because committees are driven
whenever you have more than one person
in any situation it's going to be drivel
that's why a last time when you're
asking me about boards and stuff they
don't know anything
they don't know anything
they don't they they let me know what
they want
but
there's no there there isn't a single
group in the world
that has
wisdom even if you go to a buddhist
monastery that group doesn't have wisdom
there might be one guy and it probably
isn't even the head guy
who has wisdom
groups are a dumbing down phenomenon
groups are a regressive
a regression to the mean phenomena
there's no
effectiveness well i mean the only
effectiveness coming out of a group is
you know if you want a big if you want
to lift a big heavy log or treat
yourself you know there's power in
numbers in that sense the muscle power
that's fine
whereas one person couldn't do it alone
that i understand that's fine
but anything that's on any sort of
intellectual level or
anything that's non-mechanical
um
groups will always be filled with
mediocre people
but you can't because if there's if
there's if there's one brilliant person
in that net group
he will be either alive by the mediocre
yeah yeah you're you're dead on on that
but how the hell do you build a great
business an impactful business or build
a great sports team
without having a group that's working
together in some way shape or form well
yeah you know i you know
the uh
i think the team is really a false
construct
um
there's no team
from the outside it looks like a team
but each person within that team
is a perfect individual
who is the best at his particular thing
so the group and the team that's only an
added societal label
you know the the guitar player isn't
helping the
the piano player play the piano while
he's doing guitar with left hand
right and it's only when one is purely
individualistic
and sticks to the perfection of his own
craft
that a symphony has created
if everyone's meddling in everyone
else's business
then it would be a disaster
so is that so yes
it's parallel play
it isn't really a tool
so does that then then the first thing
that comes to mind
is bill belichick and his approach to
say just do your job
if you just do your job
the cumulative effect of everybody doing
their job we're gonna
win yeah that makes sense to me yeah
that makes sense to me and you know and
here's the real consequence of of
this team
myth
is that
you know in youth sports
you'll have someone who's really good at
a particular position
but he'll be told that he needs to play
the different positions as well
you know that's stupid you know this is
you know you're just being coached by
people who fundamentally don't
understand
why
if your talent is in this position for
whatever reason it happens to be
right that's the talent that you've been
given and that person should be taught
to maximize that 500 percent
but that isn't but see that's not fair
that's not considered fair everyone
should get a chance to play in that and
everyone should get a
participation trophy
right
and
it's it's a stupidity right
if you're if you are if you are
great
at
them
[Music]
why would you play defense
you shouldn't
sure at all ever you
shouldn't now if you know if you're no
good at center
then it makes sense to switch around to
find out maybe you're an amazing
defenseman
that makes sense
but see this this the
ignorance has consequences
if you believe in this team myth
then naturally you will do
silly stupid things like
take people away from their natural
talents so that they get worse and what
they're really good at in order to make
them a little bit more mediocre and what
they should be doing
those are the natural results
of
believing in things that fundamentally
are not true
ignorance has consequences
real world consequences
this ruins people's lives
and do you feel leaders
building and growing companies can
follow the same approach
of hey do your job
and
that mentality and build a great
business
yeah but i would think that the leader
would have to would have to first
ingrain that with it himself because in
general
leaders tend to be too interested in
what
others think of him
yeah
true and that's a big hole that that
leader needs to fill before he speaks a
single word to anybody else because as
long as he is influenced by what others
say
as long as he has insecurity about how
he may be viewed
then he will not be anywhere near his in
near his
his ultimate
with regard to
the uh
the performance
that he can put forth
but do you feel that we could be totally
immune as in in leadership positions to
what others think of us
of course
yeah they're not a whole lot but not if
you live it but well not if you live in
this world of prescriptions and you
think that and you think
if you have to follow 18 000 rules no
the answer to your question is no then
it's impossible okay if you're worried
about what the
wall street journal is going to write
about you and you're worried about what
this you know you know social group is
going to say about you and you're
worried about being nice and kind over
here and not step on anybody's toes over
here
and you know
if you if you're going to follow all
those rules then i'll tell you you might
just quit your job and go sit home
because you'll be more respectable doing
that because you're just you're you're a
little man in a big chair who is just
sitting in some stupid post
and
who is not anywhere near
exercising his full
capabilities and his full talent and so
what's the use
well sometimes if the right wall street
journal writes something that's
detrimental or negative about me or my
company or about me in particular i mean
that could have some negative
consequences
so at some point that's got to be in the
back of my mind
well if
if
if you sell out
on your talent
and doing what you believe
that your instincts tell you is the
pure and appropriate way to go
and you don't do that because you're
afraid of what the wall street journal
might say
then you're an insult to your talent
and i can guarantee you one thing that
by by making that concession
you will you will have sold out on
something that might have led to
something really big
at the end of the day you gotta be able
to face yourself in the mirror
how many journals are you gonna run from
how many reporters are you gonna hide
from
or
we could just say it's fake news right
whatever the hell they write we could
just say it's fake news
um well you know the
the the greatest source of fake news is
what's going on in the leader's head of
course yeah well yeah i mean that that's
uh that's probably the subject of of
everything else that we're talking about
here but let me just ask you a couple
more things and we'll kind of uh pause
this one
when you're talking about i want to just
stick with this leaders in a moment um i
was fascinated by your
the depth of discussion that you had
about purity
and and the importance of coming from a
place that's pure
do you just when you're around others or
with yourself do you is that a feeling
that you get
of your level of purity about whatever
it is that you're thinking or or
contemplating and do you see it in
others
i mean if someone if another person is
pure about what they're doing um
yes you can see that
and do you feel it in yourself when
you're
when you're asking yourself the type of
reflective questions that you're asking
yourself and really deep questions
do you just know that hey that this is
really the essence of who i am
yeah i would i never do a solo podcast
until i'm ready to speak
just purely
regardless of who may like it or who may
not um the the arbitrator the thing that
i must be true to
are are
my deepest instincts of purity
without a single
without a single
drop of an attempt to put on a show or
to
be in entertainment or
um
you know to to play to any crowd
that
that is simply uh unacceptable
to me
one of the things that also
resonates with
me and certainly the the four other
people and and the people who at least
listen to these conversation
uh they know that you are an independent
thinker and you are definitely
contrarian
do you ever run ideas by other people
like if you feel like you need to
get someone else's perspective on
something anything
how do you pick the people in your inner
circle to have discussions like that
with
yeah that's a good question um
absolutely if if there's a topic or if
there's something that i don't know
then i will ask the per i will you know
research an individual and find out what
sort of things he's written and then
give him a call or write him something
or whatever it is and but but that's
just the first stage
i will know
whether he's real or not by
how he responds
i i
just because i'm asking him doesn't mean
that my filter isn't on full blast
because the the
the truth is
that the chances that i've stumbled upon
someone who is truly truly speaking the
truth is you know one in a million
right so i already know going in
i i really really am looking forward to
the possibility that this might be the
guy
but i kind of already know that the
chances are
fairly remote that is going to be him
but if he speaks truth i'll know it
immediately even though i may know
nothing about the topic
it isn't topic specific what is it just
know when someone
it's just you just know when someone's
speaking the truth you just you you just
know it
you you can
you know if you know you can sense fear
you can sense someone holding back not
wanting to go against the
the status quo
you can sense someone
uh intentionally going against the
status quo
for purposes just to show off
you can sense
where someone is
has really really looked into the matter
uh
outside of just having read the material
that's published about the matter but
looked into it himself and fell i mean
so there's there's a thousand little
things that you can
that we as human beings can sense
that someone's speaking the truth
and do you find that experts real
experts really don't flaunt themselves
right they're not out there talking
about or
profiling themselves as experts
i mean that that seems to be a red flag
everybody's an expert nowadays
right right that's true yeah
yeah most experts
aren't really experts
[Music]
people are experts based upon what
they've read and the more that they have
read about something they brand
themselves as an expert because they
have read but all the things that
they've read first of all
a lot of times weren't written by them
and even people who were they were
written by
they've
derived it from other sources themselves
for everything nepotism
right like true originality is
extraordinarily rare
and and i think part of the reason is it
and it isn't necessarily even
that there aren't truly original humans
because there definitely are but what
happens is that but
the truly original humans also have to
have the dna
to not be afraid of what the world
thinks of them and so that's a that's
sort of a
you know a sort of a two-pronged attack
that's required
because if a person doesn't have the dna
to say what they want to say and without
being
afraid of what the world you know might
shoot them down
then
they'll they will regress to the mean or
they'll just stay quiet
i mean that's obviously what happens to
most of the world right i mean you know
freedom
looks very different to somebody who's
has real expertise in something than
somebody who just claims to be an expert
right the former never talks about it
i don't know i don't think there's i
don't think that you never talk about
you you never talk about
you know the depth of knowledge or the
depth of expertise or you know that i
never talk about that
yeah i mean
yeah i mean i don't
because i i don't i don't know
it really isn't
that strong desire in me to really
impress anybody
maybe that's why
but whatever i want to say i say it
and do you consider that for others who
feel that way
is that have they gone away from that
insecurity of
gaining others approval and other the
opinion of others and so forth have they
gone away from that and are really more
focused on you know the direction that
somebody like you is heading
is that that com is that that total free
and freedom of the mind that that you
had described a couple of times
i think there's definitely freedom in
genuinely not being interested in what
others think of you i think that's a
massive milestone to reach in any human
being's life
because um
because that sort of imprisonment is
toxic really
absolutely i mean that that really
ruins your life
um
because you do everything in order to
get but but but even i mean
no one really does that for other people
so the people who are afraid of what
others think they're not doing it for
the other people
it's
it's that
they are afraid of imbibing
what the others may think of them
and that's a real feeling i think i mean
that's real yeah i mean
it's not real it's fabricated but it's
believed to be real
but we feel it at least that you know
with the exclusive of the five people
we feel it yes no yes yes no question
now that now the big question is or you
know maybe we leave everybody with how
do we once we have that feeling what the
hell do we do
to try to gain that sense of freedom
that you know that you describe
um that only becomes possible
when the
toxicity that one feels
in being in that position
is
greater than the toxicity one feels of
leaving it
because because when you're in that
position
uh
the the desire
for
acceptance
and validation
is greater
than
the aversion
of
the toxicity
that that situation creates it's
euphoria for a lot of people the great
majority of people
so the greatest desire always wins
so when the desire for validation is
greater
than the feeling of toxicity
for being dependent upon others approval
then
it's impossible to leave that space
we want to try to focus today on it's a
topic that you talk about almost daily
uh to peel the mind
so like we always seem to do i want to
start with a broad question and then we
will drill down
so i want to thank you i want you to
think about the work that you that you
continue to do on yourself i want you to
think about the work that you continue
to do with others
and i'm curious what is the question
that you have been asking yourself say
over the past week or so where the
question that most fascinates you right
now
about the mind
that
the only place to actually live
is in the moment and i i hope that no
one heard what i just said
because it's going to be too tough to
even listen to what i just said it's
going to be a prescription and it's
going to be
yes yes i agree and it's going to be
spiritual and it's going to be empty
but um
i wish that i could speak to you on a
very particular wavelength
as to the exact and precise
context flavor and level in which i am
speaking so that you would hear it on
the same level context inflate but it's
not going to how it's going to come
across it's going to be completely
futile well i want to assume that maybe
the ones who know us by now will see
maybe we'll hear it in a different light
but what does that really mean what do
you mean by that
it means that everything that
our life consists of is essentially um
stories upon stories upon stories and
our our moods and the things that
we succumb to emotionally are all based
upon the complexity of the fabricated
stories and that none of those stories
actually exist
and it is precisely and only
when
there is nothing in the way of a story
that we are responding to reacting to or
listening to that we actually were
living in a lot of truth
well you you summed it up beautifully in
a in a in a tweet i think
you know a couple days ago or something
he said everything in a human's life is
a game her mind's playing with herself
how do we ever win at that game how do
we win at that game by fully viscerally
recognizing that it's something more
than a game that's the win so for you
personally is that just something that's
constantly going on in your mind
have you become immune
to stories that you're telling yourself
or to the crap that your mind's
constantly saying it is a it is an
absolute
maniacal and devotional pursuit but not
yet
and i but i but i bet there is a glimpse
and there is a there's space that you
have during the course of a day
where
you don't deal with that
true
is that freedom then for you is that
what you is that what we all should be
seeking well no because it will be
sought after in a pleasurable sort of
way and then it will be discussed such
that well i had four minutes of freedom
today and the last time i only had three
minutes
that's not what i want i'm i don't want
pleasure um
i i'm i'm looking for ultimate arrival
i'm
so i was very intrigued by the dialogue
that you were having with your followers
about this
and it was all over the place and and
you you're very elegantly
chose to respond to the questions that
really were
had some depth
but what is is there a common
misconception about the mind kapil
that most of us just get wrong well i
think it's the same misconception about
everything which is that
everything is viewed
through the lens of perspective so what
are you talking about with that
you know you hear people talk about the
unconscious you hear people talk about
the ego you hear people refer
to that chatter in our mind as the
monkey mind
are you referencing the fact that hey
we're all seeking a prescription for
that yes that's exactly right um making
it academic
and making it prescriptive so how do i
for instance if there is chatter how do
i stop chat and
what are some techniques in the
so-called
disgusting word called a hack
uh what are the so-called hacks
to
to overcome these you know
mind the chatter as a as if there was a
technique or a method that one could
employ and all of the mind chatter would
stop and it's it's frankly insulting to
be able to ask that question uh if the
realm of unseriousness is so off the
chart that one should just cringe and
show
the past who should we just outright
personal embarrassment
uh and should stand naked in the street
from sinking so low as to say what is a
technique for over overcoming
involuntary thought you should have
shame before i ask asking that question
i mean
that's like saying you know how do i
hold the entire ocean give me a
technique that i can hold the entire
ocean in an eight ounce cup right it
gets serious so
this is this is why i get annoyed by
having these question answer sessions
and i'll get you know these flippant
questions that no
death as you said no heart
no
no sincerity
no nuance has gone into
the creation of the question it's just
been flippantly thrown out there they're
looking for a free handshake and a quote
i want to piggyback on some things that
i highlighted that just meant something
to me right you talk about
freedom is at the other side of the mind
where is this other side how do we know
we're getting there
um well you're not getting there so just
forget about even asking how you know
that you're going to get there you're
not getting there
because in order to in order to even
begin to get there the idea of
prescriptions has to be so completely
removed and cleansed from your system
that but that isn't even going to be a
possibility until that starts up and
number two the other side of the mind uh
you know that can be viewed in two
different ways and and the cons context
of the english language might have made
that kind of clear some might have
viewed that as um
the other side of the mind meaning not
the right side but the left side
and what i meant was
the other side of the mind meaning the
other side of the mountain such that
once someone
overcomes the mind and on the other side
is the truth as opposed to the other
side within the mind and that that when
i was writing that i felt that that
could have been misconstrued
in that way well i see it as the other
side of the mountain i mean that's how i
interpret it okay okay
um so so essentially
uh it's only once one gets past the
pandemonium from the hurricanes and the
tornadoes and the typhoons
[Music]
of stories and identities
and likes and dislikes and preferences
and prejudices
and hopes and dreams and fears and
anxieties and pressures and all of all
of the
uh
the
complexity
um and
miasma
that is the mind only once one overcomes
all of that
does
the possibility of arriving at true
freedom or truth
even become remotely possible
because what will invariably happen is
that one will enter that storm from that
miasma and try to fix things and say
well to the storm uh how is it that i
can lessen the storm how is it that i
cannot get wet in the rain
how is it that i can do x y and z
and
the mind that wants you to ask those
questions because so long as you are
asking them you are squarely a prisoner
of it as you are asking
well it's obvious that we're all
addicted to that side that's
either unconscious or ego or whatever it
is that you want to call it that is very
obvious from the interactions that
people have with you in general who
maybe haven't yet grasped this notion of
no prescription
why the hell are we addicted to that
unconscious why did why are we addicted
to that side that you're talking about
right now because that's the only voice
that is available that's the only
message there's ever been so it really
isn't it really isn't the fault of human
beings that they seek prescriptions
that's the only loud speaker that's been
playing in their ear that's the only
tune that they've heard so there's been
no opposing voice whatsoever so even
from the gurus even from the religions
even from the so-called sacred temples
even from there it has been the same
message of the scripture let's do this
and do that in 20 minutes of this and
all of this stuff so how how can anyone
reasonably expect
anything and being not to think so let's
assume for a moment that uh
we don't i don't want to live in that
space anymore right if i don't want to
live in that space anymore do you is
there do you feel like we each of us
that are serious the five people that
you and i've talked about can we train
our mind to to at least start to shift
away from
that notion of prescriptions and that
notion of that whatever it is that's
going on upstairs and to start shift
more towards truth
and i think that that shift happens
when one
um truly and genuinely examines um just
how futile and how circular
uh the
goose chase has been
and that
by continually not having arrived
anywhere
then one naturally begins to seek
ulterior means
as opposed to
following the idea that he or she should
not follow prescriptions because that in
itself would then become a prescription
so i want to ask you a couple questions
that
some friends of mine who
are big fans of yours and who who are
really eager to
dig a little bit deeper into your brain
in a moment but before we get to that
something again that emerged yesterday
or the other day as i was watching
and and
seeing you respond to
some of the messages as you're getting
one of the things that emerges from our
unconscious minds
and you hear a lot of leaders talk about
this are the mental models that kind of
guide our decision making
what are your thoughts about these
mental models that are typically
unconscious
no
those are just more
intellectual
gymnastics
and
circular arguments
and
empty prescriptions mental models are
empty prescriptions they are not the
truth they are just ways to think of
they are just constructs and if you get
nothing else out of this talk understand
this
and you don't have to believe me examine
it for yourself
all
constructs
that's one of the things that
that's really
one that i appreciate so much about how
you approach what you do because there's
so much talk about mental models there's
so much so many books written so much
chatter about uh you know the the best
leaders in the world have these mental
models
and your answer to them is they're just
like involved any other involuntary
thoughts that we're just
well they're not they're not involved
those are voluntary
i mean those are
you know they're you know
people like to make themselves sound
smart
they like to
talk about how many books they've read
and all the things that things learn
and
uh the you know the opinion of so and so
he was some scholar who has done this
scientific research on x y and z it's
all a bunch of crap okay it's not real
it isn't true
um it's all the words of others there's
regurgitation and it is derivative it is
not true it is not genuine art
is not sincere it is all frameworks it
is all scaffoldings that are suspended
in the sky
that gravity will soon demolish in the
bits
all of these ideas these mental models
are all intellectualizations
of how to approach things
they are not based upon the sincerity of
where things truly come from they are
based upon a mode of attack in order to
um
manufacture an approach
intellectualization is absolutely the
order of the day
and it is also frankly ignorant
so this question comes up a lot
obviously
uh none of us are immune to mistakes
when you
when when you look at the really stupid
and hurtful things that people do
in your opinion why do really good
people do stupid sometimes
is that your mind
of course 100
absolutely um
the reason that that happens is because
we identify
with things that are not true
we
we proceed and pursue things according
to
uh ideas that we believe are a certain
way and they are not and so by
whenever something is pursued
in a way that isn't based upon reality
then mistakes are a natural
consequence
they have to be
whenever something is pursued based upon
an understanding of how things really
are and one no longer makes mistakes
and when you look back at some of the
mistakes that you've made do you sit
back and reflect on them
yeah i mean i'm going to give you an
answer but
it's
you know i i don't want to hold back
i'll give you the truth i don't want you
to hold back but i want you to to really
help me understand how you reflect on
your mistakes so when there's a mistake
that is done
the natural consequence and the natural
behavior in a natural habit is for
someone to say either to themselves or
by way of
uh
being given advice from
some psychologist or something or a
friend
which is that okay the next time this
happens make sure that you don't do that
or the next time this happens now you
learn make sure that you do that instead
and and those are all fine and
well-meaning but whatever
whatever behavior
that one replaces with the the old
behavior that was ineffective
the new one will be ineffective too
it just may not be as egregious as the
old one was but uh the old one was
egregious because it was a pure form of
reaction right it was reactivity
well the new one is a reaction to the
old one
so it also is reactive
it isn't it is it's a it's a it's a
reactive fix
and all fixes like all constructs fail
and so when you
institute the new behavior sort of speed
then
that will cause its own problems and
then something that'll happen again and
then you'll say okay well now next time
i'm going to do this and this is what i
mean and and 50 years go by and nothing
changes and that and that's what i mean
by
all constructs fail
no matter how wonderful the idea seems
it fails it leaves you stranded in the
sahara
every single time
and as a result
one
approaching any issue from the
standpoint of behaviors
is doomed for failure
behaviors are cosmetic
so
one has to approach things if they don't
want problems or if they want to
minimize the problems that may result
by the institution of a certain actor
behavior
then one will understand the source from
where his actions arose
as opposed to
trying to spit a square peg into a round
hole
because it sounds right and because the
psychologist said and because the five
types could be happy books and so
and because society will catch you on
the back for having done so and all
these things the the
the problem the problem with doing
things in this way and the reason why
it's so easy to do them is because they
sound so nice
but things that sound nice usually
aren't right
so help me with this
there are a lot of people out there who
are very critical of themselves
especially in business
and when you reflect on something like
that whether it's a mistake that you
made whether it's uh you know poor
judgment whatever
is there a better approach for you to
take when you are self-assessing
yourself
well the natural answer to that
society will give you is don't be
critical of yourself be your own best
friend at all well you're not going to
give me that so don't tell me the truth
well the truth is that
it isn't about being nice to yourself or
critical of yourself
it's not about
it it is about what you did and what you
should have done
it's about
whatever you did what was that a
reaction to that's the truth
and so dig dig a little bit deep like
can you give me an example i get it
right and i was waiting to hear that
give dig a little bit deeper maybe on
something that you explored with
somebody or something that you explored
there's no reason
you give me an example and then i'll
go down that road
okay so i'll give you an example i'll
give you an actual exam you know what
let me let me give you something that is
very interesting i have a dear friend of
mine who is a great thinking partner for
me and he is a real advocate of your
philosophy
and he was contemplating the other day
talking to me about solutions versus
complaints and he raised a great point
he had heard you talk about
running the four minute mile before
so
you know one of the things that we
started to talk about hey if you did
indeed run that four minute mile and a
great majority of your friends which
were still running the 10-minute mile
how would that impact you would you
would that throw you off
me personally
you
um
for me
the training would occur in isolation
as much as humanly possible logistically
so that
the 10-minute mile
would not rub off on me
as being
a limit that i had to overcome
and then once i reached 959 that i had
somehow succeeded at something when it's
actually just a false success based upon
my reaction to the empty idea of
competition um so would it throw me off
that if i had ran four minutes and
someone else had ran ten no because um
because the things that i would pursue
in order to get to that four minute
would be fundamentally off the charts
wildly in the jungle different
from anything that anyone's doing in
society so it wouldn't throw me off at
all
and you wouldn't have any issues
um
you know if you were part of a relay
team and you were the guy who was doing
four-minute miles and the rest of the
crew was way behind
well first of all
you know i would know that by working
within a group of a relay team it would
also it would essentially be an active
mediocrity so because everyone's going
to regress towards me so i really
wouldn't want to be part of the relay
team i don't want to be part of any team
but what if you have to
what if you're running a business and
you have to be part of a team ah that's
different
if i'm part of if i'm running a business
i'm the leader of that business
i'm not interested in what anybody says
the last thing
a
a leader who truly wants to make
something highly unique and artful
will treat his business as an autocracy
the stupidest thing you can possibly do
if you have any sense of genius within
you
is to make it a democracy or to have
these board meetings where you look for
others to give you feedback
yeah how can how can
we how can the people who work around
rembrandt give rembrandt's feedback
about his art
see
where does this come from well that's a
great question
so these are these ideas come from
a kumbaya society
which is fearful and that society is
fearful of being unkind
and and and sitting in and
singing hymns together and everyone must
be part of the team and everyone must be
giving up trouble to participate and
everyone wants to count it and
you can run your company if you want
that way but you know also you in health
so i would let me pick you back on that
for a minute assume you're that leader
for a moment and you are kapil gupta who
is in in pursuit at mastering his mind
knowing what you know
how do you influence people on your team
how do you get the best out of them
honestly it isn't about me getting the
best out of anybody it would be about
me
bringing people on board to do highly
super specific
tasks that they were the best in the
world at
and
i would assess that dna in the hiring
process
it wouldn't be about me bringing in
someone in order to
get the best out of it don't you feel
that it's
so so then describe to me what if the
leader's responsibility isn't to
continually get the best or elevate the
people that he that are working on his
or her team what is it then
effective himself
um what human beings are most moved by
whether they like it or not and it's not
necessarily an intentional thing
uh because there are something within a
human being
that
respects something without the human
being's consent
human beings are moved
by
truth
genuineness sincerely
they are
inspired by unconfidence
they are inspired by
uh seeing in a human being what they
wish too long to see in themselves so
the perfecting of oneself as a leader
is really the best chance that one has
to influence another and quite frankly
if he tries to perfect himself in order
to improve the mother then his act of
perfecting himself will be disingenuous
and it will fail the darkness
that makes a hell of a lot of sense
it really does and i appreciate you
going at it from that angle
and in the process of trying to perfect
oneself
what approach
do the best people that you work with
is it a constant reflection is it a
constant self-assessment on you know
here's some things that i could be
better at or what what is the process
that somebody goes through to
continually go
you know in that self-perfection state
well it isn't what the best people do
it is about how
deep one's desire it is
to arrive at the ultimate
um
because quite frankly there's no one
doing these things i'm talking
so i don't have any models to give you
you are the model well so what i'll say
is if someone truly wants to write at
the ultimate what he will do is is he's
so devoted to the truth
but because he recognized that the truth
is the only thing in the world
so he will be so devoted to the truth
that in every situation he will be
looking not mechanically
if anyone walks away with this i'll slap
him anyone walks away thinking okay from
now on i'm going to ask myself is the
truth and there we go down that
mechanical prescriptive road that when
if someone truly wants to ride with the
ultimate they will constantly
be
asking themselves what the truth in the
situation is as opposed to what they
should be about
and do you feel it is it something is
the truth felt
um you are asking a question which says
how do i know when it arrives and i am
saying to you that the sincerity of your
desire to know it
is the arrival okay i'm gonna have to
ponder that for a moment but i got two
more questions for you
i know you're not a big proponent of
positive psychology positive self-talk
whatever you want to call it but isn't
that better than it's opposite
i'm not looking for what's better and
worse
do i want to do i care if there's two
war zones i want to go to the one that
has more sunshine
which is the cloudy war zone i don't
care that's a boring question to me why
would i ask that question then why would
you ask it why would you ask the
question that if two things are useless
which one is less useless who cares why
would you not ask the question what is
the ultimate
well tell me what the ultimate is
i asked i asked you stupid questions so
you can get me to the right questions
well the question is what is the
ultimate the question is not isn't isn't
positive thinking better than negative
thinking okay well isn't
you know i mean a sunny war zone is
better than a cloudy one that's right so
why live there right why not live okay
um
what
what way of approaching things does lead
one to the realtor
what you know questions exactly what i
wanted to ask
so so help me understand that then
by a desire to know what the truth about
a situation is
what the reality is as opposed to how
should i think about it what hack or
mental model
should i view this
through um as opposed to wearing some
colored lens
uh what with open eyes and no lenses at
all
what is the reality of this particular
situation how does it sit naturally
because once i know
the truth about it then i will be able
to navigate through it unscathed all
right last question a lot of people ask
you about meditation i know how you feel
about meditation
do you not feel that it serves any
purpose at all to try to get me closer
to you
a disingenuous question you're asking
for what is the minimum right do you not
think that it gives you anything at all
and and so the minute that i say yes
you'll say see so you should be
meditation no i'm not going to say that
you should know me by now
okay have you ever meditated yes sure
absolutely
and was that the clue to you that hey
this doesn't work for me correct
it doesn't work for me
it doesn't work
to get one to the ultimate right i'm not
so it's a false construct absolutely
yeah it's like going for a job okay so
someone could say once again it's all
and how you phrase the question right
if uh
is so you saying is jogging bad for you
no
am i gonna die if i meditate no but is
that a useless question yes the question
is
does meditation help you in some way and
make you feel a little better fine yeah
those are multivitamins
right the question is
does it get you to the ultimate
the ultimate meaning arriving at no
involuntary thought arriving at freedom
you know uh having
really conquered all your emotions
arriving at p no it doesn't
it doesn't let me just ask you one other
thing help me understand the best way to
phrase questions
because this really i'm i'm enamored
and very appreciative
about how you do that for yourself and
i'm not asking for a prescription here
other than the fact i want to know from
your perspective
what do you do to phrase questions that
help you reflect appropriately that help
you reflect in the types of depth that's
going to lead you to the truth
to myself or to someone else both to
yourself i mean certainly i'd like to
get better at it for myself
yeah to myself it's on a whole nother
level
um
i have to sort of pare things down a
little bit
when i'm talking to another i have to
to some degree come at it from
where they are
um
so what i'll say to you is when you talk
to
any clients of yours or people that you
talk to
you know
it would be very dangerous of you
to phrase things from the standpoint of
the truth
because unless you have vetted these
people
um
and
know for a fact
that this is the wavelength that they
really are on
it'll only spell disaster for you
because like you said five people well a
lot of people don't even know what that
means the truth right that's
misconstrued in and of itself
yeah and that's why
you know
there has to be a vetting process people
who come to you should come after they
have read your material or i've heard
you talk or so that they know
the the
atmosphere and the environment and the
the air and the plane it looks their
central rooms
so what so give me give me a sense of
some questions like we started with the
questions that fascinate you how about
some questions that you've asked
yourself that
intrigued you recently
i hate the word recently
yes
it's the same things always
it's the same thing always which is
what is it but i don't know
it's it's always it's always that
category of question there's always what
is the real truth in this situation and
do you just keep drawing down until you
find something or what what do you what
are you doing what is the truth in this
situation that is not born of reactivity
that sits on its own
that doesn't need support what is that
independent truth that isn't based upon
um
being supported by an idea from me or
from anybody else
it is the quality and the nature of the
you're one of a kind i appreciate it
[Music]
and uh so kapio first off how are you
doing well
always in zen mode uh so as we always do
i wanna i i always love to start with
asking you
to think about the most fascinating
thing that you experienced or learned
this week
so i throw it to you
it's never that way
it's never it's never linear and it's
never um
something new that i
you know it all just kind of blends in
so it's i never i don't really think of
it that way so i wouldn't know what to
say so and did anything blend in
particularly well this week
no that's just uh
that's just a backdoor way of asking the
same question no nothing happened
nothing happened at all
no nothing happened that made it
wireless and it's just very moment
no but i'm not i'm not looking for
extraordinary moments
um i have no interest in extraordinary
moments
you know i'm very much interested in
in uh
in an arrival and
whatever the
whatever the rocky or
calm or whatever the moments are that
lead to that that's all i'm really
interested in that's what what my eyes
are
well did your eyes see anything towards
that arrival this week that uh we
haven't talked about in the past no you
you just won't let it go no no of course
not don't you know me by now
nothing well i'll still
i'll still come back to the thing i mean
things just you know when they arise
they arise i don't
i don't
i don't um
think about them to talk about them i
don't i don't they come and they're gone
and usually
if they come i'll mention them on
twitter
so
in in honesty um
twitter's probably the better person to
ask
well there's a lot of talk this week on
twitter on decision making
from you i don't really
oh okay what did i say you probably
don't remember but i'm going to get to
it in a minute but i want to i want to
jump on a couple things that happened to
me this week that i want to get your
perspective on because i know we touched
on those issues briefly but
i was at a conference earlier this week
where i got to see a bunch of old faces
and meet new friends
and as i was kind of reflecting on the
way back he was in san diego on the
experience i started to think about the
authenticity of some of those
relationships
i know you keep a very tight or very
high bar on who like who you allow in
your life
how do you distinguish between
a real relationship and a phony one
you know that's a good question
you know
i don't really know if there are any
so-called real relationships outside of
the relationship that you have with
yourself
and i think that all other relationships
are basically
an extension and
a mirror of that one
so
you know i what i the things that i
enjoy talking about or exploring
um
really in honesty are the things that i
enjoy exploring with clients
[Music]
and
you know i
the social scene
i mean that's very very narrow for me um
you know i don't i don't
go to parties and
get togethers
unless i'm dragged there once a year or
somewhere somehow i don't know how i get
there but
um but it's very tight it's it's not
uh
and it's it's not because there are not
nice people in the world you know they
absolutely are
it's just that i as
you know the more i go along in life the
more it becomes painfully clear that the
things that
i want to look into
um
are not really the things that
others want to look into
[Music]
yeah and that's that's what i respect so
much about you and that's why i asked
right because coming back you know it's
a couple hour drive was just really
thinking you know there's a lot of
people who know how to put on a face or
put on an actor when they see you one of
those events or conferences it's a hello
and it's very cordial but there's really
no meaning to that relationship and you
come back and you think you know these
kind of these relationships they don't
nourish my life why the hell do i keep
them
so anxious to ask you that well
you know
i would say that
very close to zero relationships nourish
anyone's life
the thing that people get from
relationship is they respite from
loneliness
the things that people get from
relationship is a chance to
you know
laugh and discuss
things most of which are menial
so the if you look at the foundation of
relationships i mean there's nothing but
cracks in the foundation
so i'm not sure
how many of those really there there are
um
you know every every every friendship
every relationship not only is a
friendship but even the setting of
family i mean you're always just a
heartbeat away from disaster
nothing in this life is
is solid you know it's all thin ice
why do we why why do most people run
away from the relationship with
themselves very few people are willing
to ever talk about that
um
[Music]
well i mean
why why would anyone you know because
it is
in many ways very dangerous to have
those
to look into that relationship with
yourself because you find things that
you
don't really want to see
and it's far easier to
ignore
and deny
because as soon as you verbalize
something it becomes real
so the the interiority of a human being
is a very dangerous place
how do you yourself describe the
relationship with yourself like when
when you
like when i threw out that whole
relationship thing and you brought it up
about the most important relationship
and i really
agree with that is the relationship you
have with yourself how do you describe
that
you know i think it really is looking
into where all of your
um
[Music]
sort of your emotions come from
it is where you're
it's in the ways in which
um
a given individual is attached
to all the things in his life and all
the people in his life
and how those attachments and
how those
those ropes and chains that bind
um have a very costly impact
upon him or her
so i think
learning about those things
makes it clear and gives
and
an insight
into
[Music]
why one
[Music]
says believes things feels the way that
he does
i think
i think breaking apart that foundation
and tearing off all the layers
is not something that's healthy or good
for you or recommended
but in doing so
that actually is the way to
um arrive at any semblance of solidity
in one's life in which one doesn't live
like a leaf in the wind
and would you say for you personally
that's the most important work of your
life right now
um it's the only work it doesn't really
work
i mean there's nothing else than that
everything else is is simply an offshoot
of that that's the foundation there is
nothing else
and it's not really work it's by
necessity
yeah for you right i think the rest of
the world and then the rest of us
understand that yeah it is for them too
but they just haven't realized
so i'm curious what is the correlation
between some of the issues that you're
called to work on with some of your best
clients
and
their relationship with themselves is
there always a connection
it's
there's no two things to connect it's
always that
irrespective of
what they're dealing with professionally
yeah
there's
if they're dealing with it it's them
that's the issue
what does it take for somebody to see
that
[Music]
because we've been hearing you talk
about it for at least for me personally
for a couple of years
right and i'm nowhere near where i need
to be in recognizing that
i think it depends upon where you want
to go
and
where no where you no longer want to be
um
so unless there's unless there's some
impetus
which creates an urgency
then you sort of um
you sort of
you know sink into the collecting ground
so to speak and
and that's where the mind wanders
looking for prescriptions
because you don't really want it anyway
so you might as well reach out for a
morsel of prescription that you want
um
you know
so it really has to be some some sense
of urgency that arises
uh from one to even look
in that direction
and does it always seems like those
sense of urgencies are
crisis
right if somebody's facing some
difficult challenge
it's true you know it's true it's true
but
um
unfortunately even then
once the challenge is over then the
default state returns
so
um
one of the
most life-changing things
is
you know for some people is for instance
a near-death experience
you know
i think i think as a human being
i should have a near-death experience
once a quarter
because
then that
keeps a person on its toes
and it keeps the hunger alive
for
truly
[Music]
truly seeking and evaluating what's
you know at the foundation of things
so for for you does that is it a vision
that you construct to start to think of
life that way or
you know
obviously you don't know you know
no no no no no no no i i never leave it
[Music]
yeah i'm at the point where i don't i
never leave it so that's just the space
that you live
absolutely yeah i don't i don't know why
but um
i've
i've reached a point of no return
i don't need any any
any
event to make me
dive head long into
the interiority of the corridors of
myself in order to learn about the mind
that's
24 7. that's all i do and then not it
isn't even a doing i don't have any
choice
is that something that
you
try to encourage some of the people that
you work with to get into that headspace
no
no i don't encourage you that that's
something that has to be self-induced
yeah and usually those things happen by
way of inspiration
they don't they don't happen by way of
information
one of the things that you one of the
tweets that you've mentioned one of the
many tweets
that i highlighted this week was this
whole idea of conflicts between business
partners are never solved by compromises
yes help me understand that a little bit
because that kind of leads to some of
the the business relationships that i
want to get into with you
yeah the conflicts between not only
business partners but any relationship
if you if you compromise what happens
it's never 50 50 right because if each
person compromises
then what they have left after they have
compromised
is just a shell of who they are
and and therefore the relationship is
the king i don't think the relationship
should be the king
because
if the relationship is the king then
that means there's no people
it's just a relationship
so
that which you compromise away you will
resent for having been forced to
compromise away
so it isn't about compromise
it's about uncompromised
and
and
that doesn't mean what it sounds like it
means
uncompromised does not mean
that
um
this is just the way that i feel and too
bad
well
uh
if there are
each person has to reach their
non-negotiables
each person has to arrive at the the
thing they cannot do
or cannot
keep from doing
because if they do that or keep from
doing that whatever that thing may be
then
they they
they lose their center they lose their
foundation
they lose their essence they lose the
very thing that drives them they lose
their engine whatever that may be
so it is about finding what the
non-negotiables are it is about finding
what the uncompromisables
are
um as opposed to
compromising for the sake of that only
leads to problems it doesn't fix
anything
and so when when two people say
uh that when each person says
in the in their relationship
these are the things that i'm hardlined
on because it's
not for my superfluous way but this is
truly in my dna
and i
i can't cross that line nor would you
want me to cross it because if i crossed
it i wouldn't be the person that you
want to be in business with because that
makes
that's my dna
and when those lines are set
then
what can be compromised on
are the things that you hold loosely
so the things that you compromise on are
the things that you don't really care
about
you don't compromise on the things about
who you are
so i think these things have to be
worked out
and these things have to be put on the
table and i think that when you look at
things in this manner
it is a fundamentally different approach
than it is to say
i'll give a little if you give a little
that doesn't go anywhere
that's empty
and i i really appreciate that and i i
assume
the best time to establish that is at
the outset of a relationship
no maybe maybe not i mean at the outside
of a relationship
um
you know a person may not know what his
dna is you know
um so it's whenever
you know
it's whenever the person
discovers
the uncompromising
dna
and the lines that he is not willing
to cross
that and i think that's when that
conversation
can be had
you know everything has to be based upon
honesty
not for moral good i don't give too
sensitive moral good
honesty because honesty works
that's why
if honesty didn't work
i would recommend dishonesty all day and
all week
but honesty works
honesty creates something within the
heart of the
human being
which engenders him to him
it allows for a solid foundation upon
which to build things
foreign force anything of any lasting
value to occur
and
human beings are not
really taught to be honest
um
they're taught to be clever
they're taught to do x y and z they're
taught to do this and don't do that
they're not really taught to be frank
and forthright
everything and everything in society is
a
a flinch
and a beating around the bush
and they don't step on that toe and
don't say that too loudly
and and it doesn't mean that you do the
exact opposite because that also would
be reactive
but it's about moving forward with with
honesty how do you really feel about
this
no no one's honest with themselves
everyone's every everyone's a liar and
as a society we hail clever
like anybody absolutely clever it's like
wow he's on the cover of magazines
that's right or she's on the cover of
magazines
yeah um if if two business partners are
at this
relationship crisis mode where
each thinks their
their contribution is disproportionate
to the other is it too late to have this
uncompromising conversation
i mean it's never too late to have the
convert uh the conversation no
it
the resentments might have built to
a point where
it's too late to mend them
but it's never like to have have the
conversation even if it is to discover
that very fact
that it's just
it's too much to fix right
and and do you when you think about
these non-negotiables or or
the key things that i'm unwilling to
compromise on
do you have a general rule of
how many of these things you don't want
me to make a list of 50.
right are they the absolute essential
things that i'm unwilling to compromise
on
yeah it really is an intellectual uh
it's real
it's really feel in essence
um so it's not really a number
but it really comes down to
the things that you
the things that you feel in your heart
that you just can't do
or can't not do
do you have a criteria that if you were
and i know this is not going to happen
to you but if you were to select a
business partner for whatever reason
what criteria would you use to select
this individual who could potentially be
a business partner for you
you know
i'm reminded of a person
[Music]
billy b
[Music]
yeah if it's the billy being i'm
thinking about
yeah
so
there's a there's a
there's a scene in that wonderful
wonderful film
right
um
[Music]
in which
uh
moneyball in which he's talking to
the
the stats guy that they hire
and um
and he says to him
you know one way or another we're going
to see this through
either we're all in or we're not
and if we're all in
then we're going to fire the entire team
right and we're gonna
trade every player that we have to
until we get it just the way we want
because it's only then that we know
whether the
system works or not we can't go halfway
you know that's the guy
that's how things get
that's
that's exactly how things that's that's
exactly how the truth is learned
right it isn't and it would be a mistake
to assume
that because he had success that that
was the right thing to do
i fundamentally disagree with that
it was truth either way
the the truth was that you had to carry
out the system to a t
with no exceptions no compromises
and because it is only then that you
will know for a fact whether it worked
or it didn't because if you did it 90
you would never be sure if that 10
was a wrench in the system
or
the system itself didn't work
so
that
that all in type sincerity
is something that to me is invaluable
and early on in a relationship do you
just feel it
you
know
i don't know that you necessarily
you know stay
with the person that you start with you
know
these things change so
if you do and over time it
there's
um
there's you know uh
the person begins to lose his way or you
don't feel that
that solidness within the guy or the
sincerity wanes or whatever it may be
then it may be that he had it at one
time and doesn't have it anymore so it
isn't necessarily a doesn't have to be a
long-term thing
but but the willing but the willingness
to want to know the truth
the willingness and the true desire to
to you know
i would be partial to someone who had a
um
a
real
objection
uh
almost a
a hatred
for the status quo
who was who would be embarrassed to
follow the status quo
i think that would be a very
foundational element i would look for
contempt contempt for the status quo
and and how about this whole the whole
idea of
trust trusting somebody to dive into
business with is there a filter that you
have that you go through in your mind
early on on whether or not you feel you
can trust this person
or is that even important you know
you know
um trust is something that you find out
over time
you will get
obviously you will get to mistrust
very quickly if you know if that shows
its teeth
but
but trust
establishes itself over time
well you had a great threat one of the
best threads this week
was uh
about
perf making perfect decisions
and i want to just dive into a couple of
those
um in a second but is there such a thing
as a perfect decision
yes
okay describe it for me
the perfect decision is the pure
decision
the perfect decision is the decision
that is that has no interference or
reactivity
and is that what you mean by saying it
does not produce self-conflict
correct
and and is and do you and a perfect
decision does not always produce
the so-called perfect result
it may produce
it
according in in one way
a perfect decision always produces the
perfect result but the reason that i say
that
is because the perfect result in a
particular human being's eyes
is not
always the perfect result
[Music]
well see that's why i bring it up
because i think you captured in about
eight or nine words
what countless books and articles talk
about is this whole art and science or
whatever of decision-making when you
said that the decision is wise if it
does not produce self-conflict
that doesn't mean that the decision is
going to be right or it doesn't mean
that the decision is going to be wrong i
look at that as being one of those
uncompromising things that you talk
about is hey
as long as i feel
no inner anxiety when i make a decision
whether it's right or wrong i'm gonna
make it am i on the right track and
thinking like that
um
[Music]
i can i think that i think that can be
bastardized i would say that as long as
i feel nothing after having made it
then it's a perfect decision
where conscience doesn't open its mouth
and neither does fear
and neither does excitement
where there's a flat line
and
and because if you do it before
then you know people are clever human
beings
and they'll pull out their prescription
book
and they'll spend 30 minutes meditating
to make themselves calm
and then in that in that narrow 14
second window they'll make the decision
and see see i made it well i had no
anxiety
and then on the 15th second of course
they become crushed by the anxiety that
they've you know held at the door
so i think it's the one i think it's the
feeling after you have made it
so so what do you think paralyzes people
i know far too many people compel who
are paralyzed to make decisions in their
lives and one of the most important
decisions
is to is
what you and i have been talking about
for several years to make this
commitment to go on this uncompromising
journey to the truth
so whether it's personally or
professionally or relationally
there's an overwhelming majority of
people who aren't willing to make tough
decisions or important decisions in
their lives
so what's the question is it fear
[Music]
um certainly some arts of the fear of
being wrong especially in business
the fear of not wanting to see the truth
as opposed to
following the road of prescription
is that what you mean yeah yeah um
you know human beings are conditioned
so i think it's i'm not sure it's
correct to
believe that they really have a choice
between
following the truth or being
or following their
programming and conditioning to seek
prescriptions
they're not they're not
you know
sitting in a
vacuum
in which
they can truly go either way
the the
the pull and the gravity of the
conditioning is too
great which means that the pull and the
gravity of seeking the truth
as a result of either because having
become
[Music]
tired
of having wasted their lives with
prescriptions
or by
a
a genuine desire to seek the truth
either one will work
but
no one's really
sitting in neutrality
uh
having to make an intellectual decision
as to whether they will seek the path of
prescription or truth
what's the role of intuition
in your life
i think the difficulty is
deciphering between conditioned
intuition
and natural intuition
you know and don't ask me how
uh
it it's listen i've learned my lesson
yeah it's i think that question
is the greatest how there is
in this particular context
the very fact of knowing
that
the intuition that's coming up is that
arising
from
conditioning and
programming
having lived in a society is it a is it
a reflex behavior
or is it true
i think that question has to be
genuinely asked not verbally and none
not mechanically and not prescriptively
that question has to be explored
knowing that
that intuition isn't just intuition
and when do you know you're you you're
getting a glimpse of the truth for you
personally
um
when it isn't a reaction to something
and and when it isn't a
um a play
for something
when there can be no other choice
totally you all right i want to ask you
two more things and these are requested
questions
uh from people who
listen to us often
a leader wants to know um is do you have
a preferred
method
at setting organizational goals
from the perspective of understanding
that um
weak goals meaning goals that are just
incremental growth
are lead to complacency impossible goals
in her eyes are difficult to get people
inspired around
so
where is that sweet spot
so we can get an organization to rally
around something that that it hasn't
done before
there's no rallying
okay first of all
everything's got to be doing done with
one person the leader there's no
rallying there's no pep rally there's no
there's no collective
there's no group
all those ideas have to be completely
you know jettisoned
in asking that question
[Music]
whatever leader that you're speaking of
who asked that question
it should be known that this leader is
placing
a massive and enormous ceiling
upon him or herself in asking that
question no matter what answer
that they possibly could receive
the very question
is a dead end
so how how are the teams inspired vision
there's no team
there's no team
listen if you have 10 people in a room
let's be honest i'm not here for
diplomacy right we're here to tell the
truth where to speak the truth
i'm not i'm not here to
make friends and make everyone happy
it's just me to speak the truth
if you have a group of ten
if you have one in those ten
who was in unique rare dna
outside the box human
he needs to run like hell from the other
nine
because i can guarantee you
in a group of ten you're not going to
have that one
and if by some miracle you do
you're not going to have
two so
that one is going to be swallowed by the
nine so that one
needs to forget about motivating anyone
or rallying anything
that one needs to become so world class
it learn at arriving at purity
and arriving at internal wholeness
and arriving at making perfect decisions
arriving at
crystallizing his or her vision
without any interference feedback
questioning or pollution
by any of the other
nine this is not going to be written in
any book
and this is not going to be presented
right yeah that we know for sure
so no one's going to discuss these
things because
because it's
it's
it's too stark
okay
it's the absolute truth
there are not that many
rare dna human beings in the world
and the ones that there are and there
are
there are
several five to be exact well whatever
there are maybe six this week they're
never in the same they're never in the
same group
never
so wherever they are all around the
world
um
they need
to
allow themselves the permission
to be unabashedly who they are
because they are like the sand as being
lapped by the ocean of the common
who was wearing away
their foundation
so if i'm if i am this individual
running this company
and i know that hey one out of the ten
or five out of the 50 or 100 out of the
5 000. well that leader has to be that
one you know
that leader has to be that one
what the hell do i do with the other 4
500
you know
when the one is completely the one
people fall in line
that's the way usually works
if you open a door
of
kumbaya
all you're going to get is filth
and all you're going to get is
interference and noise
and all you're going to get is putting
massive ceilings on a company that could
have been great
if it had been run
by way
of
you know
a single leader as opposed to
[Music]
you know give me feedback it's such a
it's such
just nonsense it's conditioning right
it's conditioning
give me feedback as to how you think i i
mean
like i told you in the last podcast
you know rembrandt doesn't ask for
feedback
right now was one of my favorite lines
right yeah and if and if you're not a
rembrandt
then realize that
right but this is you know but you have
to ask real questions
you cannot
you cannot go to business conferences
and meet with common people
in the business community
and discuss these business ideas and
these leadership ideas and these methods
and techniques and five ways to lead
and and be kind to your employees and
don't say that and don't fire them and
fire this one but don't fire that one
and make sure i mean
who do you think this is i mean just
people are not serious
they're just not serious
they're juvenile
yeah well and and then you know they
know that uh you are certainly one of a
kind so here's my last question to you
uh one of the things that um
that i really
have tremendous respect that i've gained
from you about approaching life
is to have these non-negotiables or
uncompromising
you know ways that i want to lead my
life but the whole idea of not really
caring
about
what others think
is really almost liberating
so when i think about
people living like that
is that kind of a glimpse of what
freedom looks like
for people who really truly live that
way
i think that's a massive milestone
to arrive at
not caring what anyone thinks about you
not even your own family not even your
own kids
not your spouse not your boss
if you're famous not your followers not
your audience
not your fans
not the media
to
to not reactively but to genuinely
arrive in that place inside yourself
because you have really
explored who you are and who you are not
and the things that you have pretended
to be and owned up to pretending to be
them inside yourself
um
and
and in in
in removing all of those facades within
you
to where
you arrive at this enormous calm
because you no longer have to
put on a face
that's an enormous milestone
in a human being's life
well i i am eternally grateful for you
for helping me see that for myself and i
think whether just the the last thing i
want to leave people with with this is
it doesn't mean you need to be
rebellious
you know i think when someone starts to
truly believe that it brings out the
best in them it brings out again one of
the things that you talked about i think
the first conversation we has is it's
not about
trying to acquire more things or more
knowledge it's really about accessing
what's there and i think that feeling
enables you to access
what's inside that ordinarily probably
wouldn't have come through most of the
time
sure
so thank you we've got an exciting half
hour or so planned for you guys today as
we plan to dive into understanding the
truth only as told by kapil gupta
about your industry and i can hardly
wait for your perspective kapil but
first off how are you
doing well all right it's always good to
hear your voicemen when we do these but
before we dive into our topic today i
want to address two quick questions that
i have gotten from our audience that i
think are really worthy of discussion
the first one is something that we've
talked about in the past but i want to
drill a little bit deeper in there and
it has to do with positive self-talk and
i know we've touched on this briefly
before but
the idea of no mind that you share is
still so elusive for so many
so given the choice
this particular member wanted to know
isn't self-talk
better than the alternative
than
what a negative self-talk
but well you know just like last time i
mean i'm not sure if the listener
heard the last talk or not but i think
the question is largely uh
it's a it's a very
um
it's sort of scraping the bottom of the
barrel of a question because it's kind
of like comparing
two irrelevant things and asking which
one is less irrelevant
uh so
i mean positive self-talk or negative
self-talk or
i mean they're not that different i mean
so positive self-talk yeah it might give
you a little uptick in terms of how you
feel
but uh it whenever you talk to yourself
uh
put it this way
when you try to convince somebody else
of something the other person feels as
if he's been trying to be convinced is
that right
and that's that's my biggest pet peeve
with sales that's a whole nother topic
of conversation but yes
and so and so if when you talk to
yourself
the fact that you have to talk to
yourself
um yourself
basically your mind
uh
immediately puts up red flags and says
oh i'm trying to be convinced
and
therefore it
it puts up a brick wall
the same as
anyone puts a brick all up when someone
tries to
sell them sell them something right the
salesman's talk so self-talk is
salesman's talk
it's not real
so the only things that are real are the
things that you feel
the things that are spontaneous and are
done as soon as they're done
and then the message comes across loud
and clear whether it's another person or
whether it's oneself
that oh this person is serious it's done
so self-talk is very
i mean these are very low level concepts
these are these are very like 101 basic
human
juvenile
kindergarten type things that i'm kind
of shocked that people who have spent
so many decades of their life trying to
ostensibly trying to learn about it and
all they've come to is self-talk and
they haven't gotten over that little
hurdle it's kind of like you haven't
gone past your abc's so it's kind of
it's kind of silly i mean there's a
there's a there's a whole um
you know there's there's a whole
universe of unexplored truths that no
one's even knocking on the door you know
everyone's still stuck on this little
little
you know one little step up to the
garage door
it's it's it's juvenile
well it's what it's what modern society
and and culture really programs
everybody to do who who subscribes to
the whole idea of self-help yes it is
um
but
it's it's at what you said is absolutely
true um what i will say though is that
um
whether the people who are programmed
became programmed by modern society or
whether they became
even if modern society didn't program
them something else would have and the
reason is is because
they are to a large degree programmable
and
so we are all in many ways conditioned
but it really takes a
particular
strand of dna of a human being
to
to be
programmable only to an extent before he
naturally stops and says and says wait a
minute what's what's going on here um
so i absolutely blame it on society
there's no doubt about it but then again
society is created by human beings
and so the human beings who create the
so-called
the so-called programming are also the
very ones
who wish to be programmed
so so whether it's the one who the one
who was doing the programming or the one
who is being programmed the fact is
that that the number of people in this
world who are neither of those groups is
very small
so i can't so i can't just blame it all
upon
just so-called this amorphous
impersonal thing called society
so let me ask you well you know what let
me that brings up something that i have
heard on more than one occasion from
people who were
super elite achievers in whatever field
of endeavor they're in
that when they look at their performance
they think that the last 10 or 20
of their performance often comes from
negative emotions which is their ability
to get in touch
and almost tolerate their fears do you
see that
what do you mean last 10 or 20 percent
kind of like you know that last it's
almost kind of like the last you know
ten percent of of charging a battery
whether it's with a car or phone often
takes the longest so you know when you
think about golf for example since
you're evolved when you're involved
heavily in golf you know the step up
from winning a pga tournament and
winning a major term tournament
is that ability to get in touch with
that negative a moment that can fuel a
different level of ingenuity or
performance
um
you know that that could be true i mean
what basically what you're saying is uh
that
negativity can light a fire under
someone is what you're saying that
there's
some good to that
absolutely um negative motivation is far
more powerful than positive motivation
uh being the the prospect of losing
something
is far more power powerful than the
prospect of gaining something uh so loss
aversion is more powerful
than than acquisitions so to speak
so that's that's true that's true um but
it isn't it isn't necessarily a
strategic thing to where someone says
well i'm here i better introduce some
negative emotion or something negative
so that i can
climb on that negative step and gain
that and you know it has to happen
organically right so
so i yes
there is
there is absolute truth to that um you
know a lot of the motivation that comes
from people who achieve is that during
their childhood they were they were
ridiculed
and that is that is an enormously
powerful motivator
i love this question it
leads me to this question from
an individual who who sent it in and
it's one that i've contemplated many
times but the reference is obviously one
of the themes of the work that you do is
freedom
and the question is this individual's
asking well while i listen to the
conversations that you have with kapil
i leave knowing
that freedom is what i most want in life
yet the moment i start to think about it
fear sets in
so am i really
and i'm not really sure why could it be
that i am afraid of freedom
well i think that's a really good
question 100
um
because everything is a cost
and
if something sounds nice to you and it
may be something that you genuinely want
however the question is not whether you
genuinely want it
that isn't the question the question is
the question is do you genuinely want it
at the exclusion of all else
that you're willing to pay whatever it
takes
without any idea or any notion that you
should or that's good for you or that
it's proper or it's moral or it's
correct or it's healthy or it's
spiritual none of that garbage no do do
you
regardless of what the world says and
with no rules or regulations whatsoever
of
false morality and all of this nonsense
do you actually want that more than
anything else now
the the person is absolutely right
freedom
actually happens to be something that
everybody wants
in fact
freedom happens to be the thing
that everybody wants more than anything
in their life it is just that
um they pursue it by
the they look for water
within a rock
so
so
because the idea is amorphous
and yet the things that they have in
their life are tangible
comparing something amorphous to
something tangible becomes frightening
because you don't know really what it is
so it really is less about freedom of
and it's more about freedom from
so the question more
becomes um along the lines of uh
freedom from anxiety freedom from
fear from pain freedom from all of these
things and that becomes much more
tangible that becomes much more
understandable as opposed to you know
some magical idea of freedom what does
that really mean so they know everyone
knows what anxiety is
on an experiential level they won't know
what fear is everyone knows what failure
is everyone knows with pain and
confusion and sorrow and sadness all
those things everyone knows what that is
and because someone knows what that is
if you view freedom as freedom from
those things then it becomes much more
tangible and understandable
you know i once heard bruce springsteen
say that
to taste freedom all you need to do is
risk being yourself your true self and
the more that you and i
dig deeper into some of these issues
that is the minority of individuals in
this world that are willing to take the
risk of being themselves
i don't think there's any risk to
anything
i don't think anyone should risk
anything i think it i think something
becomes possible
for a human being when he has no choice
if there's a risk
then
it isn't worth doing
well the risk of being yourself
is also the risk of being
[Music]
unaccepted by other people the risk to
being you know ridiculed and
you know those are the things
that i think cause individuals to have
fear
although we're all in pursuit of this
level of freedom is very difficult for
people to walk away from something like
you said
well i would say that it's much more
along the lines of
freedom from the fear of losing a job
freedom from the fear
of
of
whatever the situation may be
i don't i don't think
that you can
i don't think it's practical to give
something tangible away
in exchange for an idea
it has to be tangible both ways
because only then can you compare the
compare the value of each tangible thing
so
so without what i disagree with
the idea of what spring things that what
i disagree with is
well all you have to do is this and
whatever there's an all you have to do
no one's going to do it
[Music]
nor should they because
because you know do you know why because
it's a leap of faith
and leaps of faith
they're not practical
they're all they only exist in in books
there's no leap of faith of anything if
you if you have faith in anything you're
probably going to fall in your face okay
because most things aren't ones
believing it they're not true
so there can't be any leap of faith
there can be a leap
there can be a leap towards something
that you don't know there can
but in order for that leap to happen the
circumstance of your present day
environment has to be so bad and
unacceptable that you are willing to
take but take a leap and if someone says
to you well what are you leaping towards
that person will say i have no idea all
i know is that i am not going to be here
anymore
whatever this is this is not going to
happen anymore i can't be i don't know
where i'm going to go and i'm willing to
leap all i know is that wherever i land
it's not going to be here
so that's
that's desperation
right it can never be of a sound mind
and a conscious decision
those things are no those are textbook
type things they're not real right um
it has to be something that that's
there's there's there's a longing
or a
massive aversion right everything is
about the extremes and it's not about
the moderation everything's about the
extremes it is only the extremes that
produce
transformation so let's talk about
industry and let's talk about the truth
about industry and i thought it might be
good for us to set some context and
maybe frame our conversations
around the idea
that that it's really about
entrepreneurs who are building companies
since that's primarily our audience
when do i truly know as an entrepreneur
in whatever industry
that i really do understand the truth
about my industry what does that look
like
oh that's a that's it doesn't matter
what it looks like
it matters that the question is asked
see
you it's like um it's like jumping into
a river
when you jump into a river um the flow
takes you
and when the flow takes you
you
you are moving
so fast
that you are
trying to avoid the rocks that come in
your way you are you are worrying about
the waterfall that may come at any time
right you're worried about the branches
that stick into the river from the the
bank so that you don't get cut
so everyone is so lost because
because the
the flow is so powerful and so pervasive
and so all-encompassing
that everyone gets lost in the putting
out of the fire such as avoiding the
rock avoiding the branch looking out for
the waterfall whatever it may be
uh and so
there is so much to do there is so much
uh going on
that
the the assumption is already made that
that the the questions that are
already stated when the person comes
into that industry
are the questions that he begins to ask
he never asks wait a minute are the
questions that are being asked even
relevant that doesn't happen that
doesn't happen it's always
um okay so i'm gonna jump in here you
guys are playing this game so let me try
to compete and play it too how do i get
better at this game so immediately one
begins to try to get better at the game
that's already going on as opposed to
asking wait a minute why i don't want to
get better at this game what why is this
game here and who are the opponents and
why did they start no one does that no
one does that
they
they jump into the river and they get
taken by the flow so there's nothing to
do that's a that's a a 40-year later
question that you just asked how do i
know when when when i've arrived that
what the truth about the industry is
that that's that's way down you know
downstream the first thing is
who's asking the question to say wait a
minute
who's forget i mean even more
fundamental than saying what games are
you playing
even more fundamental than that
and this is where almost nobody goes
is well what industry am i really in
no one asks that right so there are
questions that are so ridiculous
that no one will even pose them out loud
because they know that they'll get
smacked down so quickly before they even
arrive the last word of their sentence
uh because what do you mean what
industry you're i mean where are
you know you know you don't know
anything you don't even know what
industry you're in okay let me tell you
right now
there may be
three people who know what industry
they're in no one knows what industry
they're in they just know the industry
they just know
the industry that has been created in
that name
they don't know what actually it's about
they don't know what the fundament of
the fundament is and if they did they
would not join the games and then not
join the games they would ask
fundamentally different questions which
would take them on different tangents
and avoid all the
mud wrestling
so tell me what state of mind does it
take for me to at least start to
recognize
that i don't want to go down that liver
that river well there's no state of mind
it's it's either that either that comes
within you or it doesn't
right or someone brings that to your if
it doesn't come with you within you
someone
brings that to your attention or they
don't
so if it naturally comes within you
then
um
you will be elite
uh if it doesn't come within you and no
one brings that to your attention then
you're you're sunk
so you work with leaders who were
outliers and innovators in their
respective industries do you find
their approach to thinking about their
industry different than most of the
other people out there
generally yes generally yes um
a lot of times it's also that uh they i
would say more
more succinctly
that
the dna for that is there
the the sensitivity and the receptivity
of that is there the seeds of that are
there and in most cases those seeds have
already been planted and blossomed but a
lot of times they've forgotten about
those seeds because they've lived in
this environment for so long in which
the only loudspeaker voice they hear is
that of society and of their own
industry that you kind of by osmosis
begin to fall for those traps because
it's all you hear you know it's kind of
like it's kind of like uh brainwashing
in
in gitmo right they hang you upside down
they put speakers in here they do it or
not but that's what you hear right and i
you hear about prisoners of war but you
know getting
you know but loud speakers in their in
their ears uh
saying the same things over and over
again of you know what they want to hear
it's same thing right everything's gitmo
wherever you look this is all terrorism
wherever we go it's it's all this is all
one mass conditioning
there's no difference um
so
so then they tend to forget who you know
that they're not
of this ilk
um
but
but yes i mean
it turns out i guess it's self-selecting
in a way because of who i choose uh
but the the people who i work with are
they they have that seed either it's in
some it's blossomed in some it's not um
but that receptivity is always there
and since most of them are leaders does
that does that receptivity and does that
level of thinking appeal translate to
everybody else in the organization so
are they
shifting the entire ship in the
direction that they want to go
no i think it's more about them and um
the the steering of the ship
really has to be done by the top and not
by top committees but by top individuals
so i i don't i think it's a very
impractical thing to say that you know
that needs to be fed into all of the
um uh the entire company because that's
very impractical you're not you're not
going to feed
this type of dna into non-dna people
you're just not
um so
so you steer the ship according to what
you think is
you know in line with your
uncompromising vision
and everyone else sort of rides the ship
but with this democratic is this need
or effort to try to explain to others so
that they will they'll you'll get blank
looks there's there's enough time in a
lifetime to do that and even if there
was it still wouldn't do you any good so
let me ask you about one particular
industry let's assume
let's assume you or somebody that you
work with very closely is in at the real
upper echelon of finance
and that's an industry that is as
traditional and as conventional as you
come
how do you approach
thinking unconventionally about that
business
well it's irrelevant what business it is
i mean the questions are always the same
the question is
whatever the prevailing beliefs are
are they true
and what is the evidence that they are
true and who and and have these
questions really been asked
or not
well most of the time
they think they're true
right and and isn't it because they
don't they only they're providing
surface answers to themselves and it's
really all they know like if i go and
talk to some of the people that i know
and finance and ask them the same
question the likelihood that i'm going
to get a similar answer is very high
well that's but why is that
because that's that's all they know
and it has succeeded for them you know
it served them well for
i would i would ever
i would say it's probably 80
that that's all they know
and the remaining 20
is because they don't have that dna
and do you think you can acquire that
dna i think i i think it is a massive
i think it is a
i i think it's
massively misleading
and frankly incorrect to assume
that
the
the majority of people
right
who
have been conditioned according to the
prevailing dogma of their
industry
that if they were if they were brought
into a room
and they were told the truth
that they would suddenly have all that
this this amazing epiphany and they
would say thank you
and they would
they would you know
say i'm so glad i now know the truth
that just isn't going to happen
now might there be one
or maybe two in the entire yes yes but
but that so it that's why i say it isn't
just about the fact
that
that's it's all they know
it is the fact that even if they did
know
it it's
they would have to have
a certain
uh fortified foundation in order to in
order to be able to carry that truth
and most just don't
i they just don't i'm not here
to make things sound nice moe i mean i
what am i going to say to you they just
don't
the number of people i mean look at
twitter
i mean just look at the comments that i
received from people right yeah i mean
look at the comments about just me not
just me look at comment everyone
receives right
i mean most of them are very
unintelligent comments and most of them
most of the comments are
that
the
the tweet hasn't even you can clearly
tell that the person who responded
didn't even fully read the tweet
that as soon as there was a word that
triggered them that they immediately
stopped reading it and then responded
because it went against their belief
now i don't think anyone should agree or
disagree um and i don't think that
that's wrong what they did or right what
they did i'm simply making an
observation
uh with no expectation of any change in
behavior right i'm just making an
observation
that
this is the way human being the vast
majority of human beings are
no so the idea that you keep implying
that
if only they knew the truth
mo you don't even want to know the truth
nobody wants to know the truth
it's just it's just the case
it's it's just it that's just the way
things are and and it doesn't matter
it doesn't matter that someone should be
told that they should want to know the
truth it's just the way it is the you
know the the pacific ocean is blue
the sun rises in the east
and nobody wants to know the truth and
there's no wrong or right about that
there's no outrage it just is the way it
is
and how about the dna
you know the the 20 that you were
talking about
that have the dna to be outliers in
their industry
yeah can the rest of the people out
there who
are not part of that 20 percent
um capture some of that magic but but my
why why why do you ask this question
like why do you care
why okay here you know
i i'm not interested in asking if the
masses can be raised two notches right
we're not talking about the masses maybe
we talk about say 21 instead of 20.
i said the 20
that remained in
all the people who was were not going to
get it the 20 that remained as to why
they did not get it not that twenty
percent
of the population is like right look i'm
with you i'm with you so what i'm saying
is i'm not i'm not really interested
in in raising the masses by two notches
but why it didn't make any sense it is a
far more
far more promising and more productive
and more transformational thing to raise
the people who were at level eight
raised than the ten
okay because
them getting to 10 will automatically
lift the others
just by them getting to 10 so it isn't
about working at the bottom i mean this
the lowest common denominator philosophy
is is ridiculous and that's what goes on
in schools and businesses everyone's the
lowest common denominator why would you
start there who cares
let's work with the people who are at
the top and make them 110
so who do you when you think about
captains of industry who do you think
about
um
i i don't i don't i don't think of
captains in industry i just
i i'm not saying that there aren't
amazing rare dealing people out there
because there are i just haven't met
all the captains of industry to to be
able to evaluate for myself
so what's often missing between the
people who are at eight and what does it
take for them to get to that ten or even
to a nine
yeah um good question
uh
permission
you know a lot of people
highlight that in our talks or in our
conversations as
huge insights for them
dive into that a little bit what do you
mean permission permission for what
permission to get to that level
the people who are at eights and nines
mode
tend to have an inkling that
everything's full of crap
but
um something inside them says
but but maybe maybe it's not
and
um
could things really be that off base uh
maybe i'm overdoing it right
when they're given the permission to say
you know what
all the doubts that you're having
are 100 true
immediately
the tether which keeps them tied to the
earth
snaps
and when that happens
do you think that level of
authenticity or vulnerability allows
them to access whatever is left to be
able to elevate to that level
i think that
i think that if someone gives themself
the permission
absolutely um
but if i may be honest
i think many i think for the most of the
people who weren't the eights and the
nines
if they were gonna give themselves
permission they would have already done
it by now
and
and so um you know
raising
you know raising their voice against the
background noise higher than the
background noise is a very
you know it's a very um
challenging
and difficult
concept
and so it tends to be someone else who
gives them the permission
um
and
that's the way it oftentimes work i mean
not always not always i mean there are
some who absolutely will give themselves
permission 100
but then there are many others who
who you know really i mean when you're
when you live in the ocean and all the
waves say the same thing
right and you're the only wave
who was saying not only a little bit off
but like the moon
then you know it there tends to be
naturally there tends to be a need for
permission to say you know what yeah
actually it's true
everyone is wrong every way
every wave in the ocean actually is
absolutely way off base you're the only
one
and who who is who is that person that
takes them to that level is it a coach
it can be
um
the number of partner
the number of the number of people who
exist
to be able to give them that permission
is two and a
half right i mean
we've gone from five to three to two and
a half now well the five who exists we
need the permission and there's probably
two and a half who can actually give it
right the world over i mean we're
talking such small numbers
it it
the rarity of human beings
with rare dna
is
um
is not is is way overstated you know
what i mean it's it isn't understood
just how rare
it is
in this world
when you when was the last time you gave
somebody that permission
oh very very very often
and what do you see what happens
there's something that typically happens
that you see when that when that light
goes on
yeah there there
there there's a
sense of absolute freedom
when that happens because the person
genuinely suspected it all along
but all they kept hearing was the
complete opposite which is that they're
crazy and they don't know what they're
doing um
and they're you know and and they knew
it they knew something was massively off
to dna
and at that point do you just start to
see a change in behavior when you're
working with him or
what what happens after you start to see
that permission take hold
you know i don't really know i i
you know i don't
the conversations that you guys have
change yeah yeah the questions change
yes
yes
because the stakes get higher or what
no because the
the now all the stops can be pulled out
because they were they were kind of put
on layaway for so many years
yeah well this is a fascinating
conversation because all of us
you know with the exception of the two
and a half and yourself
have doubts
right have doubts about our capabilities
have doubts about our ability and doubt
that's it
yes yes right
and we want to give ourselves that
permission
right we want to be able to have someone
else give us that permission but for
whatever damn reason we don't
is it
well what are you going to give yourself
permission to do
permission to to
start to move towards that level of
freedom that we're talking about
well the permission that i'm talking
about
isn't the permission that i'm talking
about is that the
the validation and the confirmation
that
the
the suspicions
that everything when everybody was wrong
were true that's what i'm talking about
that's the permission i'm talking about
so if someone doesn't already have that
then there's no permission needed
then it's a prescription
that you should move towards freedom or
whatever it is
so that has to be so someone needs
something already has to be there
that needs permission so that it can
leave the earth
it's permission to say hey
you know get away it's almost that
immunity from what other people think of
me or what you know what my industry
thinks of me
that leads me to
ultimately become
you know unreasonably successful within
that context right that's a huge thing
yeah not caring what others think of you
is a massive milestone
yeah that's a that's a real difficult
thing
and you can't prescribe your way there
yeah what did it take when did you know
you were there
because i know you are
i think it comes down to what are the
consequences of not being there
and then
and then seeing if those consequences
are acceptable to you or not
without any sense of should or shouldn't
and so for me it's not okay like for me
it's simply not okay
um
that
that
you know what
everyone thinks of me
you know is
uh
something that i need to juggle and
uh and and change and manage and modify
are you at a point in life where you're
totally immune to to the outside noise
honestly i haven't examined that
question i think it's a wonderful
question i haven't really i haven't
really asked that question if i if i am
or am i am i not um
but i but i will say that
uh
yeah for me to give you an honest answer
i have to truly examine
but it's
i mean it's a fairly good way there you
know
yeah you're definitely you're definitely
there okay my last question to you
has to do
with with
the the scope of entrepreneurship that's
going on in the world that you know it
seems like
you know at least in the valley and in
other places in tech
that
in order to create something really
break through you have to do what no one
else is doing
and you know people approach that by
coming up with mood shots and so forth
if you were working with a group of
entrepreneurs who wanted to start
businesses with the thought process like
that
how would you help them think
i would i would
um
have them approach the matter from
the standpoint of what will give them
ultimate satisfaction
as opposed to
what will give them
pleasure
and what does ultimate satisfaction look
like is that personal for each of us and
or collectively as indiv as company
builders absolutely it's it well
it's for each person each individual
person what satisfaction looks like
for them um i think it really comes down
to getting away from chases
and and with a
with
with clarity and wisdom and calmness
and serenity
to examine
why
one was
in the business that they're in
what business they actually are in
that they didn't know they were in
and
to move away
from anything that is done in a reactive
fashion
that will
only lead to a chase
such as being better than another person
right so none of these things have to do
with being
wrong or right it's not wrong
to want to be better than me nothing is
wrong
there are no rules
there's no morality there's nothing okay
there's just nothing
so
what
what is truth
is
when i arrive at this place
which place do i have to arrive
that will
no longer cause me to chase
and and
that isn't wrong either it is just that
if you no longer have to chase
then you don't spin your wheels then
you're not constantly thirsty and hungry
which also means you don't really give a
damn about your competition right that i
know in your eyes they don't exist
yeah i mean i i think that if you
if you compete
um
then
you haven't really found anything that's
worthy
because you you haven't arrived at
something that is
truly
uh otherworldly
you're just one more of the same
perhaps a little bit better or a little
bit cheaper
so that's that's and that once again
once again it's personal um like like so
to me
that's boring
right to play the
to play the
um did i lose by an inch or win by an
inch game to me that's boring
now i'm
no one needs to take my view that's for
me
right so i would never tell someone else
you know
why would you do that that's boring
because it may not be for them
it may not be boring for them
i still i still think it's leaving a
massive amount on the table that that's
true
but
one must approach things according to
the way that he feels and what moves him
and what inspires him
does that go the same thing for athletes
or golfers
absolutely yeah athletes
athletes don't really have the yeah
things are just like the the executives
and the see they're all the same they're
all the same no one really asks where it
is that they want to go
they want to win tournaments and
championships
well that's
right don't we no that's too vague
that's too vague
you have to find out what the ultimate
destination is and it may be that
winning tournaments is a part of the
avenue which takes you
to that destination but just winning a
tournament or not
that's boring
that means that you're rolling the dice
every single week
what's the ultimate what's the ultimate
vision to be the best in the world is
that is that what we're talking about
sure it would be the best in the world
that's that's that's more tangible right
um
you know that it something
something
the destination has to be clearly
spelled out
you know i was i was talking to you know
i was talking to a tour caddy you know
um at a had a
pretty big pga tour event
and i said you know we were it was it
was a rain delay and we were there
talking and i said listen um
you know because he was having trouble
with his player and he said listen
you need to go ask him
who do you want to be
and he looked at me and he said doc
listen
if i asked that question to my player
he'd fire me
okay and he said if you ask anyone in
this room any of the tour players in
this room
uh that question first of all they
wouldn't know how to answer they'd never
ask that question no one's ever told
them to ask that question and they
probably fire you for asking it
right i can't ask my guy that question
you see so this is
no one you know the number of people who
are truly exceptional
even on the pga tour or the nba or in
silicon valley or
you know wherever you want
is
is is my newt mo minute it's a fraction
of a fraction of a fraction
so let me ask you
for the three that are serious
how do we start to contemplate that
question how do we start to really
explore this whole idea of what do we
want so you're convincing me that most
of us think we know what we want but we
really don't
people don't know what they want because
they never really asked the question
and the reason that they never really
asked the question is because they're
too busy chasing
so i'm trying to think about that
chasing goals
whatever whatever chasing whatever the
flow of the stream is
in order to ask a question
you need to have space
you need to have
time away and a mental
um
uh sort of
time out
from
the flow of the river you can so that
you can actually ask that question
no one really
uh
no one really has that time
or gives themself that time because
they're too busy
you know the next meeting the next email
the next phone call the next you know
business lunch the next you know lanyard
wearing conference right the next the
the net the next they know employee to
hire no there there's a line of
796 fires
that need to be put out
right
there's no time and space
to
free of those fires to be able to ask
that question and even if
there were
then that time and space would be used
for vacation
so all the time in a person's life
is spoken for it's allotted
fascinating stuff man
i guess we can hit pause on this session
uh i want to start you and i were just
talking about your boys uh and i have so
much respect for the manner that you
work with them on their golf game
and i was reminded of that over the
weekend watching rory mcilroy win the
fedex cup and i remember you telling me
that
his approach to the game is what's going
to make a difference to his career tell
me what that's all about because i got a
hint of that on sunday
well i don't think that though i don't
remember saying that but
you just
saying that
that doesn't just apply to him that
applies to anyone it's always about the
approach it's always about the
the lens through which you look at
something
uh it's never really about the x's and
the o's
how does how what do you see in him what
what got him over the top
you know i don't i don't think it really
goes anywhere to say well this is what
he did and so everyone can learn from
that and go to the same thing i know
those things don't go anywhere those are
those are just um
sort of pets on the back that you know
they don't mean anything it
um
i think i think it's much more
effective
and applicable and practical to talk
about
what it is that prevents
performance
much more than what it is that enhances
it i i think knowing what the knot is
is a far more effective route
than because no one really knows what
the is is
and so
the knots
are
are actually it's a much more effective
route
to go
what is that because there's obviously a
strand of dna that separates these
world-class performers from the rest of
the world
what do they see that the rest of us
don't
yeah i don't i don't think you know
that's once again
i very much shy away from the seven
habits of effective people that i just
do
you know i i don't so so i don't want to
put anyone on a pedestal and say well
these guys are great and
i just don't uh i don't i think every
human being has
the potential to be great and so i don't
think anyone should follow anyone or
look up to anyone so
um
first of all i don't think that tour
players should be compared against
weekend golfers i think that's scraping
the bottom of the barrel that makes no
sense why wouldn't you be better than a
weekend golfer and weekend golfers are
used as scapegoats to make the tour
player look better
so it really is judging
within the pga tour than his pj tour
versus
your 72 year old with arthritis i mean
what kind of comparison is that i mean
if you have to go that low then you must
not be very good
you know so why would you compare
yourself again against the lowest people
in terms of their ability and their age
and so forth so
what is it that makes someone truly
exceptional and
i think it really
comes down to
understanding
and understanding of how the game is
played an understanding of what things
are standing in my way
that has prevented me from getting to
where i want to go i think it's much
more about the roadblocks than it is the
signs and the arrows saying go this way
so
you know if you look at someone like
tiger
um
it there's a lot of things that went
into
that
in in creating a tiger woods and
it wasn't it wasn't all x's and o's in
fact x's and o's were a
you know i would say it's the minority
um because
others have the same if not better x's
and o's than tiger
but no one had his results
so
that means that there must be something
else and it's always in the intangible
it's always in the viewpoint it's always
in the level of drive the level of
inspiration the
the willingness to examine the things
that the majority
in the culture do not examine um
it's always in those types of things and
this in the soft things
not in the things that you can
categorize and put on the blackboard
which is where society always looks
society is
is um
the culture of golf is no different than
the culture of business
because it is filled with the same kinds
of human beings who are
afflicted by the same disorder of
looking at the cosmetic and looking at
the form
as opposed to looking at the source from
which those things arise
so like when you talk about when you
talk about tiger for example and when
you talk about the intangibles i know
that a lot of times that leads back to
introspection and it leads back to the
mind give me an example of some of these
intangibles
um
you know for instance ernie ells once
said uh when he was
you know i think tiger had won by 15
shots the u.s open at pebble beach
and
they interviewed arnielle's afterwards
and it's a it's a
illustrative interview because
first of all he was getting hammered by
questions and
the grace with which he handled the
questions was was very impressive i mean
some of the questions were very
insulting actually and they shouldn't
have been asked that way
um but he still handled handled it with
with real
real um
calmness and
and grace and
and one of the things that he said was
um
you know this guy shows up every single
week to a tour event
and he's at 115
his drive his
level of focus his concentration his
you know
is is off the charts every single week
and he said i can't say that about any
other tour player
so
that's an intangible that isn't that
isn't a swing plane issue that isn't a
grip issue that isn't a how far do you
hit the ball issue that isn't a trackman
issue right there's no technique there
you can't methodize that
um
so that
and and
the bang for the buck there is huge
to have that drive is the foundation
upon which everything is built
that level of motivation where does it
come from
right well you know well well where does
that come from exactly i don't know i
don't know where dna
comes from but tiger's dna has always
been i i don't want to just win
tournaments i want to be the best of all
time
and that that's always been his drive
where does that come from why
did that arise in him and not in another
player i don't i don't know i don't know
why we have the dna that we have
um
but that's always been his driving force
it isn't isn't to win golf tournaments
it's been to be the best of all time to
be a legend
would you put serena williams in that
category
i don't know enough about serena
williams but i do know that their
upbringing was very interesting you know
richard williams did a lot of very
interesting things and once again he was
a real rule breaker he was an outcast he
was an anti-culturalist and you'll you
will find that thread
amongst all greatness it's never been
the rule follower it's never been the
traditionalist it's always these people
who do everything outside the box
not letting them play junior tournaments
um
you know
when they were when the girls were young
playing on a tennis court with which
gunshots were going on in the background
and not moving the family because
the gunshots going off in the background
would allow them to
force them to focus
and become
you know have thicker skin you know a
lot of very interesting things a lot of
eccentricities there
that are very noteworthy
so where do you see the role of coaches
compel
with people like that like if they're
sitting in a locker room talking to
their coach or
you know a couple days before a
tournament or a match talking to their
coach what are they talking about
you know i i think it's much less
you know important or instructive as to
what they're talking about as it is to
talk about
the role of coaching
i think that
just like all things you know
it depends upon the dna of the coach
and just like there are
there is no tiger woods besides tiger
woods
there really is no coach like that
so um
so it isn't about
coaching it's about the coach
it's about
the human
and
to find a human
who completely
shatters the norm who turns his back on
everything who rejects all norms and
traditions you know those types of
humans
are very very rare
and so it isn't about coaching because
that doesn't mean anything that's just
regular people with regular dna
going to the seminars wearing their
lanyards getting certified
and teaching a bunch of crap that isn't
coaching that's that's just means
nothing i mean it doesn't matter what
they're talking about it's drivel
you know it's about what is that rare
one in a million tiger woods type
individual
you know what is that conversation like
that's instructive not what the norm is
like who cares
well you're a coach
and you're playing a big role in the
development of both of your boys
who have very ambitious futures and
you're coaching some very prominent very
successful leaders in the world how do
you see your role with them
it's very different as a parent
than it is as um with a client
and
not because it should be
but because it is
and
that's actually a flaw
that's a flaw
in me
and the flaw is
that
where there is attachment
there is interference
and so the greatest so so
the greatest role that i can provide is
the one that i haven't provided yet
um
i have done okay
but nowhere near the nowhere near
perfection and
one approach is perfection
when
there is no emotional involvement
no desire in me
for the student to do well
as long as that exists
there will be
there necessarily must be
interference
so let's stick with that for a moment
then we'll get to to the leaders where
there is a little bit different of a
relationships
your boys are really really close
when do you start how do you know
the time's right
for you to move closer towards maybe
eliminating that interference
um
i think the interference is always there
so the time is always
right so so it's about
approaching the
the state
in which
everything is on the player
and
finding that line as to
when to say when not to say
and that is not done prescriptively
that is done
by first reaching the internal place
where you need nothing from their
performance
and
so i guess what i'm saying as the words
as i'm hearing myself speak is that
the ultimate parenting
becomes not being apparent at all
or a coach
the ultimate parenting becomes
one in which
you
divorce yourself
from the from the need or the desire for
an outcome
there must be nothing in it for you
i think that is the bar
i think that is
that is the place of truth
which upon reaching it
one does not interfere
well for you
that
knowing you the way that i've
gotten to know you
you want the best for them
right that's how do you separate
yourself from that
that'll always be there i i think i
think i think i think it's
no parent wants the best for them
without
without
being attached to the pleasure
of
wanting the best for them
right so we don't ever
no parent is that pure
that
they want the best for them only for
them
and there's nothing in it for them for
the parent
there's there's always there's always a
level of impurity
and there's always a level
of
there's always
um
as they say you know a fly in the
ointment
well it's tough to see your kids suffer
well
well i don't well i'm not talking about
tough i'm not you see i don't i don't
want to justify it by saying that's okay
to be that way because it's tough i'm
talking about truth
it's all about truth so i don't care if
it's tough
right i don't want to justify it i don't
say it's okay it's not okay
it it's
it is
if there is a journey
the journey is in getting to the place
where you are concerned only with you
if you are concerned only with you
that actually is the most selfless way
to be
as ironic as that may sound
because
as long as you need someone else to do
well
you will interfere and you will say well
i'm doing it for them and you're not it
may be on a fringe level that they're
gaining something from it no doubt but
you are not doing any you're not doing
it for them
and so this is a very difficult
conversation to have
because
very few people are at the level of
desire
to actually want to divorce themselves
from the need or the desire
to have something in it for them
therefore they will go to the place
where you went which is
well
nobody wants to see their kids suffer
and it's very difficult to get to that
place and that's only natural and it's
human nature i don't care about any of
that stuff that isn't truth that's just
cop out okay
and i'm not telling you i'm there
i'm actually pointing the finger at me
live
and telling you
that
that is a source of interference
how do you
do you ever specifically think about
ways that you can
help your boys in particular certainly
some of the the athletes that you work
with
learn how to embrace pressure
depression no i i don't i put on the
18th i don't i don't know if it's about
embrace that's forced
i don't like
embrace and
um
you know accept
verbs are don't sit well with me because
it's always prescriptive
um
it
so why do certain people thrive in the
most intensive moments
there's no there's no why to that
some people just do
they enjoy it
and some people do not
the
the question only arises
when someone comes forward and says
that i have a problem
and the problem is that pressure really
gets to me
then it becomes
a something to go into
because then the person
actually
wants to do something about it
um
so then it becomes relevant
so what do you do to coach somebody
through that
well
it's never about the thing right the
thing is never about the thing
so the pressure is just the
manifestation
of something that's going on deeper
and so
what is it the person feels that they
might lose by winning
what is it
that the person feels that they might
lose by losing
so the the pressure is
the billboard
but the billboard isn't the truth it's
the wires and following the wires all
the way back
to their winding source
to where they're plugged into
that gives
electricity to that billboard that's
where
the real questions lie
and
the issue
with
teachers and instructors and
psychologists and coaches is
that they they
they fall
for the problem
that they're presented they fall for
that trap
and therefore they attempt to fix the
billboard
but the billboard never is the problem
the problem that's presented to you is
never the problem
i think there lies the art of coaching
well you talk about to a lot of sports
psychologists and they tell you that
dealing with pressure is something that
can be taught
well
do you believe that no no i don't
because you'll never own it that way
i think i think what a person needs to
learn is not the techniques of how to
deal with pressure
what he needs to learn
is the understanding and the insight
as to why the pressure gets to him
and what things are truly at stake that
if those things weren't at stake
then the pressure would automatically
not get to him
well you shared something with me
earlier about something that
about when i asked you a question about
your son and you talked about the
importance of ownership that when that
ownership when that that that real
full-fledged ownership is there then
you'll start to see the type of progress
that you want to see what do you what
does that type of ownership look like
yeah it's a dangerous word when you just
mentioned it nakedly without context
because i know where everyone's going to
go with that they're going to jump all
over the prescription bandwagon and the
ball type word and say ownership is that
you must be you must own and be
you know own your actions be responsible
for what you said that's not what we're
talking about so let's just short look
at that real quick before that train
leaves the station uh uh ownership what
we were talking about earlier was we
were talking about ball striking and so
the the ownership
of
one's artistic movement
in this case
striking a golf ball
um so the the so to me it needs to be
owned without any chases
and something cannot be owned
if you attack
the mechanics
and the technique
and use that as the lens
through which you look at the movement
because as long as you look at
the technique and the mechanics of put
your arm here then the next step is do
this and then don't go across the line
don't get laid off when you come back
down the hips leave the
you know leave the down swing and then
you swing left and leave the make sure
the club face is square at impa you know
all those things and the track man's and
then all the nonsense
when you chase it that way
you chase forever
because
you can never own a physical movement
by focusing on the actual physical
movement
you have to own
the things
that you already have
which give you clues as to whether the
physical movement is on or off
as opposed to a code standing behind you
telling you that they're on or off
and if you look at the evidence
for that being the truth
you have people on the pga tour who've
been working with a swing coach for 30
years
or various different ones
well shouldn't you have owned it by now
what have you been doing for 30 years so
that must mean
that must mean that very fact
that they
that they still need someone to tell
them to think something is off and that
this is off and that this is off
that means that
they are relying upon an external agency
to guide
their physical movement
therefore they cannot arrive at
ownership it's like tiger said once
tigers are the only two guys who owned
their swing
mo norman and ben hogan
and they woke up every single day this
is his quote they woke up every single
day knowing that they were going to hit
it well
now that's a he said that in a way that
that's
like it's mystical
right
and and and actually that is mystical in
today's
form and technique and method obsessed
environment that is mystical
um but that is
all that matters
it's about putting an end to all the
chases
and and you know and and it also comes
down to who you are like
like
it isn't that anyone needs to listen to
me
um
this is just
not okay with me to not own something
but if someone else might say and and
the majority actually would say this
they would say you know what's wrong
if i have to work with a coach and i
hire the coach listen i got 20 million
in the bank i'll hire a coach stand
behind me right he's if i if i have a
question i put him on speed dial i said
hey why am i my ball going right and
left he'll come stand behind me again
why what's wrong with that
and i would say nothing's wrong with
that
nothing's wrong with it i could never do
that uh that that to me would make me
cry it means i'll never own anything
that you know like nicholas said
nicholas said that he saw his coach once
a year
and jack grout never once stepped
on to a in onto a tournament grounds
and because
he wanted jack to be his own coach
and that allowed him in the middle of a
round in the back right on sunday to be
able to fix his own swing
well you're not going to have that if
you have speed dial coaches
so
it depends what's important to you
and if that's okay with you
then that's okay with you
it depends upon the person
well that's really intriguing to me
because
let's shift gears for a second and talk
about how that translates to a leader
running a company you coach you may not
want to call yourself a coach you work
with leaders who are running
big companies important companies
prominent companies what is your role
with them how do you ignite
that human potential from them
i don't know
i don't i don't know what it is that i
do i just don't know
i don't remember conversations
i don't remember how how results
came about
i didn't make any specific result come
about
the only thing that
my allegiance
is to is the truth
and
so the one thing that i can say with
absolute certainty
the one thing that i do know
is that
when a human being is exposed to the
truth
something fundamental within him begins
to change
and i don't know how that alchemy
happens
but it is an elixir
that is too potent
to not have an effect
so do you when do you know is it in the
questions they're asking you is it in
the dialogue that you guys are having
when when do you get a glimpse that that
person that you are
a confidant to
is getting closer to that truth
because there's a level of ownership
there too right they have to own it just
like we're talking about professional
athletes
yeah
when they notice
that the reactions that they normally
had to things
are
now different
without them trying to do anything
different
that's when you know something has
changed something fundamental
without any practice
no practice
no behavior change
no
implementation of a technique or a
method
no deep breath
know when this happens i will
walk away and countify nothing nothing
when the initial reaction
to the thing
is fundamentally different
than it normally is than it has been for
years
without having done a thing
that means
something in
the viscera
has changed
and does that mean a heightened level of
awareness of themselves
is that where a lot of this stuff starts
for these
leaders i think where a lot of it starts
is
the
movement away
from prescriptive ways of thinking
i think that is
the
greatest uh tectonic shift
which occurs in a human being
is the movement away from the how
well it takes a hell of a lot of guts
sometimes especially in business
when you receive funding from a you know
significant amount of funding you've got
people on your board who
have achieved the level of success and a
claim and who are almost kind of um
expecting you to follow a certain path
because they want to return on their
money takes a lot of courage to say no
i'm going to do it a different way
it only takes courage
if it is acceptable to you
to do it the traditional way
it doesn't take courage
if
doing it according to the way within you
is non-negotiable
see this can't be an intellectual
decision
then it's courage
and then it usually reverts it doesn't
last
so only when it only when you you can't
do it that way
and you're willing to be fired
not that you should not that that's good
not that that's courageous
but for whatever reason
you just can't it it goes against your
nature
that's not courageous
that's just inevitable
without naming names do you have some
examples of some situations with some of
the people that you worked with who have
been able to to have that level of
ownership
and have started to to recognize their
approach or their reaction to certain
things has shifted
and what type of impact has that had on
their companies
oh absolutely
but none of those were orchestrated by
me
well of course they were i
initiated the dialogue and asked the
question
no because there was
no because i had no
goal in mind sure right but it was you
that initiated it because if we were if
it wasn't for you
you know
maybe not necessarily the prescriptive
approach but we would have continued to
do what we would do and that's the truth
well okay but i'm saying it happened by
side effect right it happened
as a natural effect of a cause
it wasn't because i did this
i would i'm the most clueless of all as
to what i might have done i don't even
know what i said yesterday
you asked me four questions to begin in
this dialogue i didn't remember any of
them
so
okay so so
there's nothing
there's nothing um
as you said prescriptive that i did to
make that happen because i wasn't even
looking for something to happen
it's just it's just a
it it is just a
it is not it is just an exposure to the
truth
that's what it is
it is it isn't that i said this all
right but you led me there your
questions led me to
maybe explore areas or
observe certain things that
perhaps i was blind to in the past
maybe maybe but even i mean if i may be
honest
those things sort of came through me you
know they didn't really come from me so
i'm i'm very hesitant to take any credit
for anything
because
i because i don't own it
it just appears you know so
i can't walk around with a billboard
saying look what i did
um it just came and so if it came that
means it came from somewhere else so
that's the owner right it wasn't me
but but yeah maybe in the in in the um
in the exchange
uh in the dialogue in the examination
the exploration that some things came
out
that as you said make made the person
look at it differently and
you know made a shift
by way of a question absolutely those
things do happen
and do you see that once that shift that
when you recognize it as their confidant
coach whatever you want when you
recognize that somebody's made that
shift and have consistently gone
to a different approach to handle thing
these things do you see it sustainable
is that do i just kind of live there now
yeah that's the difference between
prescription and truth
um
there are some consistent phrases that
i'll hear again and again from people
who have experienced this and that is
that what
i would rather die than go back and be
the old way sure
and and so
the thing about truth is that once you
once you transform
you never transform back
but in change through behavior or
prescription or therapy
you tend to for your for the whole of
your life you tend to always live in a
in a flux of
today i was good and today wasn't
yesterday wasn't so good and you always
flux back and forth
you change back
but when you when you get a glimpse of
that truth
you feel that
resorting back to the old ways
is torture compared to living in the
space that i'm living right now yes
because the only reason that you were
doing it the old way to begin with was
based upon your level of understanding
which resulted in you doing it the old
way once you arrive at a new level then
that means that your fundamental
understanding has changed
so therefore
the inevitable way now is the new is the
higher level
you mentioned your you you show up
differently
because of the relationship with your
bro the the leaders that you work with
obviously as opposed to the boys
how do you show up for the ceos or
founders executives that you work with
by not showing up
so i have a meeting with you in 15
minutes how what are you thinking about
you just do you just show up and it's
just basically me coming to you with her
here's the that i'm dealing with
yeah the greatest
so-called
input that i could provide
is input that does not come directly
from my mind
it comes something that comes
in a channeling speaking in tongues
fashion
through me that i do not interfere with
that is the best way that i can provide
insight
so i literally mean that when i say
how do i show up by not showing up
and how and do you help them
i mean do you give the people that you
work with working with homework to
no my god
no how could you even go there
never in a million years
so you don't go there
homework about what go read this book or
go think about this or go journal
no don't do that no
no no there's no prescriptions there's
no activity there's no behavior
there's no practice
those are all prescriptive modalities
that make you focus upon an activity in
the hopes that the execution of that
activity will lead to a fundamental
change but it will not it will only make
you focus upon the activity itself and
therefore you will get better and better
at doing the activity but will not reach
the thing for which the activity was
prescribed makes a hell of a lot of
sense couple questions that i promised
some people that i had to ask you
um there are a lot of people out there
that listen to us who are in the
business of selling
and that group so it seems to always be
motivated by beating last quarter and
last year and that becomes exhausting
when you talk to
you know
elite sales people
about how do they start to develop or
what mindsets they need to get in to
develop a level of sustained excellence
where it isn't the goal
it's something bigger
what should they be thinking about
well
they're too focused if that's their
approach they're too focused upon
selling the other
without having first sold themselves
well that's that that's the training
that they get right that's the thing
right well
if it is
it's not effective i mean
the
it's easy to sell something
when you know that selling it for any
price at all is too low
sure
and no one gets there or very few
get there
so it isn't it isn't about
selling to another
it is about examining what you really
have
what the truth about it really is
um
and
the
the place
about your product
where you are
that is
the success
or the failure
and you're selling it
like give me an example of what you're
talking about when you say the place
um
the the
the level
of the level to which you are convinced
that this thing
will do x
uh
better than anything else
or that you can't get it anywhere else
then
the selling
will arise from there
and you won't have to do much
selling
it'll sell
the the problem is that people don't get
to that place and they're not really
taught to get to that place and even if
they are they're not done so
prescriptively so it's a non-starter um
i mean if you're selling used shoes well
i mean it doesn't really matter then
because
you know it
it depends what you have
and
if what you're selling is
a commodity that
everyone on the corner is selling
then
you will likely be tempted to sell based
upon
price
and
that is a
road to nowhere that's a road to poverty
um so
if you have for instance a restaurant
and there are other restaurants who are
obviously
selling the same type of food that you
are
then it really then the issue becomes
one of marketing
and
marketing is a very very interesting
subject
because it is all about the human mind
and it is not about once again
we return to the same place it is not
about
technique
and method
and i wrote a discourse about this
not too long ago
and i i don't know what it's called the
truth about i saw it what was it called
i i don't remember the exact title but i
saw it and shared it with a bunch of
people that's actually where this
question came from okay okay um
you know that that's a very fascinating
topic
because it's all about
the mind of human beings
and not about the 15 things that you can
do to get the word out
well it's a fascinating topic and you've
i've never gone there with you about
this idea of marketing right and it's
something that maybe at some point
um i think you said something
and i may be screwing it up it's about
why all marketing is a scam or why yes
yes yes something to that yes that
sounds about right right yes
it would be it'd be a fascinating
conversation that that we could have
because that's a whole different topic
that is based on a lot of prescriptions
but two more quick things and and we can
at least pause for this segment and you
and i kind of touched hinted on this a
little bit when we spoke about earlier
this week there are a lot of leaders out
there and i don't know if it comes up
with the people that you work with but
there are a lot of leaders out there
who um are very vigilant
about working males working with females
females working with other females and
so forth and so you know and so on in
this kind of era that we're living in a
me too
how do you recommend
that male leaders have relationships
with female executives female executives
have relationships with other female
executives
you know in the modern society today
what what what is crossing the line in
your opinion
i think crossing the line is when one
diminishes
his native human
or her native human capabilities and one
diminishes his or her native human
capabilities
when they begin to view themselves as a
hymn or a her
it is about
the human
and what the human is imbued with
as opposed to
the
limitation that one imposes upon
themselves when they view things through
the lens of male and female
so is that a conversation that you would
have with your team let's assume i have
an executive team of 10 people half and
half is that so is that one of those
non-negotiables that we need to
establish as a team is to talk to one
another as humans and to kind of put our
feelings aside
i don't think it'll work
because it's all about the dna of the
individuals to whom you're speaking
you cannot you cannot drop information
on top of people like confetti it
doesn't work that way
most of the things that i say
are not going to be applicable to the
vast majority of human beings even
though they are fundamentally applicable
to all human beings but in order for
something to get in the bloodstream
it has to arrive on the doorstep of an
individual who has a particular dna
um whose bloodstream is open to such a
thing so i'm also leader of a company
and i have that dna because you've been
working with me and i'm i've made that
shift that you're talking about and i
want to have this conversation with my
teachers well well then isn't it that
it's about that it's about you
it's not about your team
you can sprinkle all the fairy dust on
top of your team and they all just laugh
at you
they're not going to do anything that
you say
so
the greatest thing that you could do the
most effective thing that you could do
was for you is for you to imbibe the
truth
and whatever dealings that you are in
with that that that that shows up
through you
that's all you can do and it and as long
as you focus upon as long as you focus
your efforts upon trying to change the
mind of another or to make him better or
to enlighten them you are wasting your
time
because
the fact is
there's only so many
years
that we as humans live
and those years are most effectively
spent perfecting ourselves
and if something is ever going to get
across
it is going to get across through
osmosis
much less
than instruction
so the byproduct of me
perfecting myself is others getting
better who are around me
if it is going to happen at all
that is how it is going to happen it is
not because you give a talk
hmm
all right last thing
somebody asked me yesterday what
constitutes a great life for kapil
so i thought it was a cool question
how do you define a great life or do you
no i don't think that majority are ready
for this but i
the great life is which in which
one is completely oblivious to himself
that is the great life
that that means
that one functions in a way
that is organic and natural
from a place of non-ego without trying
to be egoless
to understand that everything that a
human being says is filtered through his
own personal selfish desires which are
based upon the foundation of ego
and nothing is pure
and to arrive at the place that
everything is done from a place of
organic
naturalness
as a natural effect of a cause
without any attachment to the person who
is saying it
and are you there
no how close but well i don't know how
close but i will say that that is
a
24 7 driving force of my life
and the byproduct of that i assume that
uh
starting with your boys and everyone
around you
it just becomes
i mean just becomes the way to live
right it becomes a non-negotiable
well it's the only way to truly live
but i wouldn't recommend it to anyone
well it's it's uh it's a good vision to
have how about we leave it like that
okay
thank you sir thank you
[Music]
i want to talk to you about something
that i've been contemplating for a
little while and um i want you to assume
with me for a moment
that you have a world-class college
athlete
who played college football for a
prominent institution
and that 21 22 year old young man is
used to winning in fact the ones i'm
thinking about i think probably lost two
games in four years of their career
they then get drafted by crappy nfl
teams
and then they start to lose and then
they lose some more and then you see
their damn performance tank
what happens
well that's i would say that that's
person dependent i don't think that
always necessarily happens uh so you
know i don't think it's a matter of
reverse engineering it and assuming that
that's the outcome
so it's it's all personal based some
people be you know sort of
um become that and others uh
either don't stand for it or look to be
traded or
whatever it is and others maybe even
step up
um because because it's an environment
in which
they're giving given an opening
so i don't i don't think it's
i don't think it's universal
that way but team sports provide
obviously
many more elements and many more
variables than individual sports
so i'm thinking about i'm thinking about
a couple of nfl teams who have been bad
for a long time and they continue to
draft because of the draft order of
football
these
very talented kids from really great
schools i'm thinking about teams like
the giants and the jets and the redskins
and
and then these team these players show
up
the teams continue to lose and along
with that
their performance doesn't
you know they're not carrying a team to
victory so when you say it's person
dependent i get it
but does he does the environment have
that much effect on these kids because
they're contractually bound to that team
for a while
um
you know once again i think it's
this is sort of monday monday morning
quarterbacking you know
it is it's sort of sort of sort of
well i don't know i think it's more
intriguing
to actually talk to a person and figure
out what's really happening as opposed
to saying
well naturally if he goes to a losing
team he's going to lose and
and sort of take that and run with it i
think it's much more intriguing to
figure out
what is really going on inside of a
person than it is to make
you know so-called
uh these judgments and these these
universal
um
sort of
rules
so let me reframe the question this way
if you if you are working with somebody
who is a winner in all aspects of life
right and he or she goes to a losing
environment that that is just
known whether it's in sports or business
how do you help that person not let the
environment pollute her mind
well it depends what they want
you know everything everyone does
you know
everyone
is predisposed to doing
and pursuing that which is their
greatest desire
so you don't desire in order to act
your actions determine your desires
so it's
you know it really it it's a
multi-factorial thing it really depends
upon what the person really wants and i
think it's i think it's um
short-sighted simply to say well that
person's in a losing environment and
they want to win it's deeper than that
so like we'll give give me an example of
it being deeper than that if i if i'm if
i'm a young man
and
you know i haven't lost but two or three
games in four or five years and probably
very little in high school and then in
my first nfl season i'm gonna be part of
a team that's going to lose 15 games
well i think that when someone first
comes into
um
you know the major leagues so to speak
in the
professional side of things it isn't
just about winning i mean there's a
there's a there's a big
uh learning curve there's a lot of
things that that person's trying to get
used to and acclimated to
and so in any environment
a person naturally finds his or her own
niche in his her own place
it's always related to self-image
and
when that person settles down in that
environment
then he will naturally when all the dust
settles he will find out for himself if
that's something that he can environment
and we can which he can live in which he
can flourish or which he actually
succumbs to
and that isn't necessarily a conscious
decision it really is
based upon the person's dna and what it
is that he truly wants so i don't think
it's as black and white as the way that
you're posing it
if one of those
kids were your one of your boys
and
you know part of the evolution of
playing a team sport not that golf isn't
a team sport
maybe in college it is but
and they go in one of these whether it's
nfl or
nhl or or major league baseball or
something and they go into an
environment that you know going in these
teams have lost
perpetually
i don't think it's about winning and
losing
i think that
on some level everything is an
individual sport
i think it's team from the outside but
on the inside and inside the human being
it's individual
so
a person could be on a losing team but
that person could excel
and by excelling as an individual on
that losing team even even if by
individual that also means that the way
that he passes in the way that he makes
other players in the team better that's
those are still individual skills and
traits
and so in that sense he increases his
brand
so i don't
i don't think it's just about raising
the trophy
i i would say that i would say that the
team
obfuscates and complicates everything i
think really
at the end of the day everything is an
individual sport
well this is a topic that fascinates me
and that's why i wanted to you know when
i and i heard a lot of these kids over
the weekend knowing you and i were going
to connect talk about hey i'm not used
to losing i'm not used to losing i'm not
used to losing now you kind of yeah
that's a very immature
and
short-sighted and they are immature and
and and it really but but then again
they've been taught to be immature
i think that if you look at every facet
of society
um particularly in the world of sports
it
you know the depth of things and the
nuance of things just like anywhere else
it's never really examined
it isn't just about the x's and the o's
it isn't just about the winning and
losing it is about winning and losing
for the coaches
it is about winning and losing for the
management because at the end of the day
what is a professional sports team
it's it's a it's a hot dog sale
at the end of the day
at the end of the day it's what it is so
it's not about it's an entertainment so
while the player doesn't view it as that
nor should he a player that's his
livelihood that's that's his art that's
his craft and that's very appropriate to
look at that way but for the people at
the top it's
it's bottom line so
i don't think that the way that they
look at it i think it would be a mistake
um for the players to look at it the
same way that management looks at it
so
perfectly then to
one of your signature insights that i
think people who've listened to our
conversations get which is the whole
idea and the notion of giving yourself
permission to be great
ironically that's one of the areas that
i get the most questions or the most
ahas from people from
so when you have somebody who's 22 23 24
whatever who truly feels
like he or she can carry a team on their
shoulders and can take a losing
organization and turn them into a
winning organization
what does that dna look like like what
do you look for in somebody where you
say hey
that person can make a real difference
well i guess a quiet sort of confidence
a um
a
you know it's all the regular things
right it's a
it's someone who doesn't follow the
crowd someone who isn't really there for
the socialization
you know someone who is really focused
on what they really want
it's it's those kind of things
so when when you talk about this idea of
permission
what does it take for somebody to be
truthful about you know what
i'm done with the past i truly want to
give myself permission
to be
the best in the world at what i do
when when you're talking with somebody
do you feel that that's sincere
well i would say i would say the
question is the opposite the question is
what is it that's preventing you
what is it that's preventing me
yes
and not only what is that's preventing
you
more specifically
what is it that's always prevented you
from being world class my mind from well
that's that's a nothing answer
that that's that's that can be said
about anything
specifically
one it it is not about
it is not about
you know
looking for what it is that one needs
it's much more about looking at the
barriers
okay so so so you know you you know very
well
inside of you right now
if i held a gun to your head i'm not
going to play your game
i'm not going to buy whatever you say
okay
that's your mind
so when you give the answer my mind
that's your mind saying my mind so that
we don't have to go any further and i
can give you some five-step plan that'll
that'll fix everything okay
that's what i'm not gonna fall for
what i'm saying to you is right now as
we sit here right now
you know exactly the things
that are preventing you
and you don't want to look at those
things
in order to
shove those things under the carpet
you want to give you want me to give you
a camouflage
and that camouflage that you're asking
from me is a prescription
because you are simply looking for
anything and any everything that you can
occupy yourself with that will prevent
you from having to look at the barriers
so so let me throw out some of the
barriers right and and help me think
through it fear
too general you're right now what you're
doing is fishing okay so right now
you're tossing me a bone
in order to make me think
that you are in fact speaking the truth
and looking at your barriers
so that i will succumb and say okay
that's good enough now i will give you
the prescription that you seek
so let's talk about fear of failure
i i don't think it's fear of failure i
would say it's more maybe fear of
success
okay
let's talk about that
so
and that goes back to self-image
which is what you wrote about this week
or two weeks ago or whenever and i have
some questions about that but yes
a person always defaults to his defaults
so a person always becomes what he
believes himself to be
so you can you can behave your modify
whatever you want right you can bring
the whole
you know coaching gang and the
self-improvement fanatics right and the
raw raw motivational speakers and you
can hire a big old hall and you can just
fill them with all this motivation and
at the end of the day when they walk out
of that hall they will default by the
time they walk to their car
and that's why i'm asking so so what i'm
at what i'm asking what i'm what i'm
saying to you is
what you will become
is
who you believe yourself to be
what you will become
is what you
cannot
stop yourself from becoming
what you will achieve
are the things
that you cannot help but achieve
what you will accomplish
are the things
that you cannot live without
accomplishing
so at the end of the day
your story
your fate
your destiny
where you will go it's already been
written
and it's been written by
who you believe yourself to be
so you acting it out is just a formality
there's no amount of behavior
modification or raw raw that i can fill
you with
to become
the world's greatest
if your self-image and your dna
is not that of someone who must be great
who must be the greatest in the world
who when i put a gopro on
with follows him around the house every
single day
that that i become convinced
by all the things that he does that are
very convincing to anyone who watches
the video footage that this person is
completely obsessed by becoming that
so everything in your life
is already written and you don't have to
look at that from the standpoint of fate
but from the standpoint of who you are
on the inside
that is who you will become
so what's the process then so one of the
things that you talk about in in
the discourse that you write about
self-image
is that most of us are never enough in
our own eyes
no no no one no one is enough in their
own eyes when you when you view yourself
as a personality when you view yourself
as this
self called
john or joe
you cannot be enough
you can raw raw yourself into believing
that but you won't genuinely believe it
so where does that deficiency come from
then well the self can never be whole
you will always have deficiencies you
will always have insecurities you will
always have fears
a person a person who is conscious of
himself
such as self-consciousness
is a person who will always have
insecurities about that self
so a person is at his best when he isn't
aware of himself so when he is playing a
sport or
an instrument or whatever it is for a
brief period of time
when he loses his concept of self
and he is completely lost in
that art
he is at his best
and at that moment he has no
deficiencies
and the reason that he doesn't is
because at that moment he has no self
so you can't you can't mandate a self
enough
to make it whole
and this is why
the self improvement and the self
development and the spirituality and the
motivation that's why all of these
multi-billion dollar industries are all
founded upon
a
completely false concept
therefore it's a house of cards
it is
do you personally have days where your
mind
is just a constant stream of negative
thoughts
well negative versus positive is
irrelevant
um
most of if you
if you but why is it irrelevant aren't
don't don't you feel there's some
thoughts that are more negative than
they are positive
so when you go outside and you go to a
landfill is there some garbage that's
that's more clean than other garbage
probably not
no
there isn't muddy garbage there in human
feces and then other garbage which is
relatively clean and
like a like a nice perfectly clean
bottle that's empty maybe
okay the same thing with thoughts so if
you would never go to a landfill
and compare
cleanliness versus
dirt
then it's the same thing with the
thoughts human
beings believe that the mind and the
intellect
are something to be proud of
and
this false notion
is what they're fed by society so you
don't you don't think
that it does it doesn't matter what i
think
it only the only
no no
the only significance here
is that you are convinced of the
opposite
and that isn't right or wrong i'm really
not convinced of the opposite but that's
so that's why i asked the question so
when so maybe i should take the negative
stream out of it and just say a constant
stream of thoughts maybe an abnormal
amount yeah the mind is the mind is that
the mind is a
barking dog
when that dog doesn't stop barking
during the course of an hour or two
hours like what do you do nothing you're
not going to stop the mind from barking
and if you try to
you'll be basically trying to
bail water out of a sinking boat with a
teacup for the rest of your life
because the only reason that you're
trying to stop the mind from barking
is the reason why it's barking in the
first place
do you understand did you understand
that i do that's why i hesitated yeah
okay what did you understand there i
understood that that the moment that i
put my conscious effort to stopping
whatever is going on in my mind
right whether it's negative or positive
that's the actual that that whole
recognition and movement towards trying
to change something is what's causing it
when i should just ignore it
so why
so no well you just
totally destroyed it when you said just
ignore it and move on
because that itself is an action and
that will lead you right back like a
u-turn to the mind
so the only reason that someone wants to
stop the mind from barking is because
they wish to feel the pleasure of peace
the reason that the mind is barking in
the first place is because they wish to
fulfill the pleasure of desire so the
the the search for happiness
and pleasure
is the most fruitless search of a human
life and it is the single
most critical reason
why
a human being lives in suffering because
we're searching for for constantly
trying to seek happiness well you don't
even have to be constant but yes but
you're right it is constant
happiness and pleasure
both the same yep
and away from the other the the opposite
the fear
and all of that yes
a chase for pleasure and an aversion for
pain
and and if you hear that
and you think to yours the moment that
you think to yourself
that yes i must stop doing that
you're done
because you're doing it again
because the only reason that you would
even want to stop searching for pleasure
and stop running from pain
is because you want happiness you want
you want once again the same thing
when you think about self when you wrote
about the the
beautiful discourse that you wrote about
self-image
did you consider your own self-image at
all
when you were writing oh how do we know
about the world how do we know about any
human being
we know it to ourself
so the person who examines himself to
the utmost degree
is the person who knows all human beings
so can you give me a contrast between
what
kapil gupta's self-image was 10 years
ago and perhaps what it is now well i
don't think it's a matter of
comparing self-images
i think it's much more a
what matures over time
is
seriousness and sincerity
and as we grow older
we begin to see
the
the folly of things depending upon
how one is wired uh we begin to see
the foolishness and the silliness of
of
the things that happen in life and
um you know moving through life and all
the events that happen in life and how
we think about things
and so as we begin to look into those
things and see
the the foolishness of it and to see the
holes
and the falsehoods of them
then we begin to
or at least i began to examine
the nature of the self
so it wasn't about me having a better
self
it was examining into the nature of what
a human being really is
and what are the source of all problems
um
so it's it's much more a movement away
from self in that in the direction of
you know this is going to come out the
wrong way but selflessness but has
nothing to do with what you believe to
be selflessness
because there's nothing but self in
selflessness in the in the in the
traditional
meaning of selflessness
and are you are you at a point now where
there is no self-image
you know
it's really
yeah i mean it's a it's a fair question
but i think that for me even to answer
it would be to fall for a trap
because if i was in a trap
no no no it isn't you you aren't posing
it as a trap but it is a trap for me to
walk into it because if i say
yes i have no self
you know that is a contradiction in
terms
so
let us just be sincere and honest
and leave it at
i am
devoted to examining the falsehoods of
the self
and to see the outer boundaries of those
falsehoods in order to discover truth
and then when when that happens
is that when the dependency on others
and the dependency on your team and
society and all just doesn't you don't
give a damn about it anymore i think i
think i think
when you begin to see through things and
you begin to see around corners and you
begin to see the falsehood
in things that you used to believe were
true
then the things that you see as false
automatically begin to fall away
there is no added step
of making them fall away so there is no
real detachment
it is that when you see that something
is false
one automatically
disengages
not by any conscious effort
but
just because it's false and the second
that it's noted to be false
and one
deeply seeks truth
then the disengagement happens all by
itself so everything happens by itself
anything that you must do by volition
and
an intentional effort
and interference
um
is
is false
so you don't call the work that you're
doing on your self effort like no you
ask yourself absolutely not
absolutely not it's
it's sort of
it's sort of like moving through a
jungle um
and you're not trying to build anything
you're simply looking at the jungle
you're simply trying to figure out
how the jungle is arranged and
if these trees are real or not and if
you pass your hand through the trunk
does your hand pass through or does it
get caught in the trunk
so it really is an examination in
exploration which was completely and
utterly not
prescript prescriptive
it is not a conscious observing or an
intentional i will watch my thoughts all
those things are a complete moving
towards prescription and moving away
from truth so absolutely not i would not
call it effort i would not call it
practice by any means do you consciously
sit down
every day
and
no i don't consciously do anything it's
just where i live
like if you if you live in los angeles
do you consciously try to live in los
angeles every day it's just where you
live it's where you it's it's
it's it's your home
there's never
it's never not there there's no i will
take time out from my schedule now to
sit there there is no schedule
this is all that exists for me
and the and and there's no reason i mean
i even hesitate saying that because
there's no reason to like think that's
great or anything it's nothing
it's we are
you know i'm not a good person because i
happen to be
um devoted to discovering the truth
about life that wasn't my choice
but i know a whole lot of people who
follow you who would like to discover
that truth who look at it as
really hard work maybe that's the
problem
well
that is the problem but looking at that
being the problem is also the problem
because as soon as you say that's the
problem then you're going to try to move
away from that problem and as soon as
you do
you run into a world so what's a better
way to look at it
well
is to be genuine is it is to is to
understand that you will never go
anywhere else but where you are
you want to be here or you're standing
here and you want to be over there well
the only way to get over there is by
understanding where you first are
and human beings are not taught that
they are taught to run over there
and to do this this this and this to get
over there well the more they do this
this this and this it just gets them to
this this this and this so wherever
wherever you go you can only go from
where you are
yeah and i guess people have to really
understand that
so they get so they can go there i get
asked a lot about
your private discourses and and the
difference between what you share with
the public and what you share privately
and
the point is are you approaching
different topics with your private
discourses or are you approaching the
same topics from a deeper perspective
well the topics i
uh write about in the private discourse
is i i publish the title and maybe even
an excerpt
sometimes
on twitter
so they're there for everyone to see
at least the title is or the expert
excerpt
but
i i don't
like there's no
you know a a constant exposure to truth
for whoever we are
a constant exposure to truth or to
untruth
that is
what seeps into you
and so it really is about
what you are exposed taking that to
another level is
what you are exposed to inside yourself
so the sincerity within yourself as for
the search that you are on
that is the thing which speaks to you
and it's not good or bad
so
you are constantly exposed to that
search whatever your search is
and
that's what shapes you that's where you
live
so whatever i write about it is a
a completely speaking in tongues
um
sort of
you know so-called flow state sort of
writing
of no mind which comes about a topic
which just comes through the page
there's no like
system
to it
and do you finish
close the book and publish it
or
do you go back and re-look at some of
the things that you've done no as soon
as
well i mean in many ways i'm not the one
who writes it it just gets written
through my fingers somehow and so
when it's written it goes out is there a
sense
when you make a decision whether it's a
decision to publish something or whether
it's a decision about your life or your
business when do you know you've made a
really good decision
that's a very good question i don't
think it's about having the decision be
very good
i don't think that there is a right or
wrong decision about anything i think it
i think it really is where do you want
to go
and is
what is the
motivation behind what you did
in line with where you want to go so if
for instance you're
genuinely seeking truth
then
you will
genuinely
have your motivations be aligned
with
publishing that which comes from your
bones
without being interfered
with by
uh
you know
anything that is that is that is not
truth uh so not not not tainted
by for instance if i was to go back and
edit things to make them sound better
you know that would that would destroy
the
that would destroy what it is that i'm
most seeking which is to truly genuinely
allow the deepest things to come out
untouched and raw
so that
so that frankly i may learn
so i think it's much more about the
alignment of that as opposed to the
alignment of your decisions with
right or wrong or good or bad
so when
you're working with leaders and they've
got big decisions that they've got to
make
and they ask you for advice it's all
does it always do you take them in that
direction
to help them see that it's not about
right or wrong because sometimes that
could mean somebody's livelihood oh sure
absolutely it's always about that it's
always about taking them in the
direction of truth
taking them in the direction
of
what is it that you really want and what
is it
um it's never about drawing a line down
the page and putting
you know positives and negatives uh it
there are benefits and losses and it's
never about about that
you know
a lot of times
most times maybe even always
people have already decided
without deciding
something within them has already
decided
and a lot of times they ask just for
permission they're not asking because
they want to know what to do and and
it's really
it it would be
untruth for me to say
that if someone's at a fork in the road
and they ask me which way should i go
um it is
it's completely disingenuous
for me to say go that way it makes no
sense that isn't a genuine decision we
are in many ways chosen we don't really
choose
yeah i totally believe that but i do
that sometimes with you even in these
conversations i do that i probably have
a sense of one way or the other
but it is gratifying if you get
validation how about i leave it like
that what what is that telling you about
somebody who tells you hey i'm your
validation means something to me that
means that the person's looking for
happiness an ego and self-image and does
it say anything what about that
what does your validation have anything
to do with anything
that that's just that's just an ego
boost it's a it's validation because
it's you're somebody that i trust you're
somebody that i respect okay let's say
that let's say that you're you made a
decision to do x and then you asked me
what do you think and i said yes that
was a great decision
so what
what does that buy you
aside from a very short blip on the
screen
of good feeling of satisfaction or
whatever it is that's going to be gone
by
by dinner time so everything is
irrelevant do you understand see every
nothing means anything
so what that you feel good
that that has
that has no relevance and the reason
that it didn't the reason that it has no
relevance at all is because it's it's
it's like wind passing in the night
it doesn't last it doesn't stick around
so at the end of the day it's yet
another clever example
of
seeking pleasure
reinforcing self-image
so every all things in a human life
come back down to that
it's just like in business
everything sooner or later returns to
money
true in the same thing with human beings
everything sooner or later returns to
happiness and self-image have you ever
consulted anybody when you're faced with
a really tough decision
a friend family member
you know here's my honest answer to you
in time has passed i have and as i was
doing it i knew it was for entertainment
purposes only so i assume now you don't
i if the more the more critical the more
critical the decision
the less reason there is to consult some
more because
that's when it needs to be the most pure
the decision that doesn't mean anything
you can consult all you want because it
doesn't matter so once again the truth
everything is opposite
yeah of course everybody who listens to
you knows that now
um you said something in in in this
thing about self-image because you've
brought it up here a couple of times
that a man doesn't improve himself he
only improves his self image is that the
constant race that you see a lot of the
people in the world doing is everybody
trying to just
is everything about that nowadays
well how could it not be
if this is if this is all that one knows
how could it be about anything else
so is the truth to to
to be immune from that
no the the truth
the truth
lies
in
desiring to know the truth
and that can't be a recommendation there
are
i think everything for good or for bad
it just goes back to dna
it just does
and it's not
genetic dna it's just
how someone is wired
everything always goes back to dna
a person who is a chaser
and is always seeking happiness
and has no interest in really
um diving deep into find the core of the
issue
and that
that has revealed itself in all domains
of his life which it always does who you
are always reveals itself
that person is going to die like that he
just is
there's nothing that can be done your
fate is sealed by your dna now
and even if you come to the point where
you have an epiphany or a realization
that you truly want to walk to the path
of truth and you never have before that
also is dna
the dna and the seed of that dna of
seeking the truth or having the epiphany
even that existed you are not going to
change who you are
and self-improvement is a complete sham
i am with you on that but when you talk
about you're not going to improve who
you are change who you are yes that is
not a message
that is not a message
that anyone wants to hear
and uh quite frankly i'm not here to
please anyone
you don't need the last person you
should believe is me look at the
evidence look at the obituaries it
happens every single day it's been
happening for millennia you don't need
to look at me and ask me what the
weather is when you can open the window
and look outside
so what what is why is there a reason to
live if i know that i'm not going to be
able to change myself that's a person
that's a question you should be asking
yourself
but you have to have the dna to even ask
yourself that question
right now you aren't asking that
question you're asking it out of
out of
uh
out of a sense of outrage
it isn't real no it really isn't it's
kind of a sense of respect i think
it's it
when
a person who has the dna will look in
this in his mirror and he will not ask
that question out of outrage he'll ask
that question sincerely
it is precisely that person
who actually
will
seek truth not because he should but
because he can't help it and and if you
examine his life if you examine his
schooling years and if you examine
previous jobs that he's had you will
always see seeds of that
you will never see some wholesale brand
new spontaneous personality the seeds of
who someone is have always been there
like if you look at a writer the
person's always been a writer
even when they were small they used to
just write on on the back of
you know gum wrappers it's who you are
has always been there so
so it i'm like i said i'm not here to to
to ease the pain
i have no interest
i don't talk to anybody most of what i
write isn't for anyone to be honest with
you quite frankly i don't know why
anybody at all would read what i write
there's no positivity or negativity or
actually you might assume it's negative
or negative right but it doesn't but but
it doesn't matter that it's truth the
only person who would be interested in
the truth is the one who is genuinely
seeking it
the person who isn't interested in truth
he is seeking positivity and happiness
and that is
that is almost everyone
so i'm not sure why i have more than one
follower on twitter it makes no sense to
me and and the followers go up i there's
no one who's even who's more shocked
than i am why are you reading what i'm
writing it has it is it is the most is
armageddon almost right it's it's
telling you that you are going to be the
way you are forever you're never going
to get better self-improvement is a scam
you know
you're going to die why would you why
would you listen to that right why
wouldn't you put on a motivational
speaker or you know or put on nice you
know dalai lama and listen to liftiness
and enchanting and you know and quite
frankly most do
so
so i
when you ask me this question why are we
even here what's the point of even
living
well
what do you want me to say
it is what it is so
either you ask that question out of
sincerity because you're the dna to do
so and you ask yourself or if you ask me
i'm just going to respond with silence
what do you want me to say
again we
the people who do follow you and i and i
know that i speak for the ones that i
know
not only appreciate what you say but
i think the most important thing is it
challenges the way they look at the
world it challenges the way they look at
themselves whether they choose to seek
truth or have the dna to seek truth or
not that's for them to decide but that's
why at least the core group of people
that i talk to consistently about you
and what you do in your work that's kind
of the thing that comes up so
let me look at it from this perspective
i understand the dna
let's take a group of kids who were in
from from however way we want to frame
it
underprivileged they don't have access
to this stuff
yet
somebody wants to give them a chance
and wants to expose them that hey you're
young you're talented
whether or not you have the dna here's
here's a an approach to see the world
look at the world from truth don't look
at the world from all the things that
you hear
would you look at something like that
and a group of kids like that for
example as
having the remotest of possibilities to
change
yeah to seek truth well i don't think it
would be a change
i think it would be there you would be
pouring water on some seeds that might
already exist okay so the answer to your
question is absolutely okay how should i
start to feed them because i have a
group like that how should i start to to
water those seeds you're not going to be
able to do it can we expose them to some
of the work that you do
in little tiny glimpses or
or have them i i have feed them some of
the discourses and some of them look at
me and say hey wow this is amazing but
you know feed me what do i do next
so the more serious that someone is
um and even my other kids i think
they're all under 17 or 16 or something
like that
the more serious that someone is in
guiding someone
the less they will preach to them
the more serious someone is the less
they will answer their questions
because all questions will come in the
form of prescription
because
everyone is everyone is
brainwashed by society into asking for
prescriptions
so
if
someone asks me questions even in the in
the private consultant i don't answer a
lot of times just remain silent because
nothing i can say i'm not going to buy
into the question if i say yes then
that'll take you down this road if i say
no it'll take you down that road and
both roads will lead to the same hell
so
the only answer is for somebody to frame
a question where you don't go that path
or is there a way that no because now
you're talking about trickery right now
you're talking about is there a way to
manufacture a question you know
what i'm saying is you know a genuine
question when you hear it
and and so
as for
you know helping your group of kids i
will honestly say that the watering of
the seeds will come through exposure to
truth without trying to teach them to
preach them or to answer their questions
and and when because the you know people
who read my work it isn't about me
so there's some form of alchemy that
happens between the words and with
whatever happens to lie inside of them
so it's between those two elements and
when that happens it happens
there's nothing for me to say right so
it is about it is about an exposure
to
the type of water
that they might have the seeds for all
right so let me leave that one there and
let me just ask you two more quick
things are there any questions in
particular that you're contemplating
right now and that you're writing about
that perhaps you haven't published
there's all there's so much stuff i
don't
i don't know where to begin i mean it i
don't know there's it's just
one this week that that no no it's never
like
it's never like that it's never a menu
it's it's
it's everything is spontaneous so
whatever comes on the private discourse
it just spontaneously arose it wasn't
something that i planned to do
the question the questions are whatever
they are they're always relating to the
truth what is the truth about
this
situation what is the truth about
arriving at this
what is you know it's always
it's always about an arrival it's always
about getting to the complete
indivisible
nucleus of of the cell so when a
question like that arises and you don't
have to give me the question do you just
start to write
or do you sit on it
i i write when things
arise and there's
um
there's a desire to explore it
and the writing is the exploration and
the desire to explore opens the gates
and the words come
and then once that's done do you revisit
a similar exploration or once you do it
once that's it no there's no rules it's
it's whatever
it's whatever arises
um last question you wrote a discourse
about nothing what does the word nothing
mean to you do you even remember that
you know definitions don't go anywhere i
re i vaguely remember i think it was
called a discourse about nothing nothing
i had no idea what it was about i have
no clue i don't remember
i don't remember anything about the
discourse but i do remember the title it
had something to do with us posting
photos on twitter and instagram
and we're selling ourselves and all of
that and that to you is nothing
but as i read it i started to think is
there something to the word nothing to
you
you know
i would say that it's about seeing
once again not not forcing it upon
yourself but it's genuinely about seeing
the emptiness of all things and that
nothing has any significance
uh the ultimate truth
which will benefit no human being except
maybe one and they probably aren't even
listening to this podcast
um the ultimate truth
is that there is nothing
there is no greater truth than that
and the and no intellect in the world so
rules don't matter we'll ever be able to
decipher that
no nothing matters no there's nothing
nothing you know
everything operates according to its own
rhythm
everything operates according to its own
cause and effect
and any attempt to interrupt that rhythm
in any attempt to
modify the effect
that was
naturally occurring by a particular
cause is a road to
suffering pain anxiety and failure so it
is about understanding things and it is
about seeing what the rhythms are and
what the patterns are
instead of and you know
a leaf
rides on the surface of the river
and in doing so it assumes the power of
the river see that's intelligence
that's that's wisdom
more than intelligence
and that's the nature
following its rhythms
so it isn't about you know human beings
or have this hammer and nail and this
brute force mentality
whereas wisdom
is much more along along the lines of a
willow tree
it's it's really going with the wind and
it's really harnessing the wind as
opposed to fighting it
i think that type of sensibility is one
that arrives to truth
and do you feel it when
if that one person are probably not
listening to this podcast or that one
person is around you do you feel that
when they're do you feel that sense of
authenticity and sincerity when they're
getting to that point well you don't
have to get to that point you can tell
one's dna
by the things that they say it's very
very very rare
to encounter a person with rare dna
and
and i don't mean just that a person is
really good at golf or very good at i
mean those are that's there's many of
those
i mean but i'm talking about a person
who is
genuinely a a rare a rarity with regard
to
how he dissects things how he views
things
um
being completely opposite of how the way
everyone else does it
it's very rare to run into that and when
you do
it's exhilarating
because
you have found you know you've found a
unicorn
any have you met anybody lately who kind
of had that impact on you no no i i i
haven't
but
what often times happens is that someone
will write something and it will be
promising
that they might be a that type of
individual and then a few paragraphs
later
they'll
sadly deflate
and
um
if only they could have kept going so to
speak
you know if only the you know it's sort
of like reading a you know a person who
writes a book
and they write something and you say oh
wow this this you know this person may
be going along the lines of truth
and then within a page they
they just
they they sell their soul within a page
well here's the five step plan i was
just waiting for it right as soon as you
did that you you just fell you know the
the the roof caved in the floor fell out
and everything went to hell you know you
were you were doing so well right you
were you were showing such promise you
could have been the one but then you
sold out you showed your true colors and
now you have removed yourself from the
as a candidate of the rare one
the people who tell the truth the people
who are like some of these ancient um
very ancient like zen masters who
couldn't give two cents whether you
understood didn't understand couldn't
care less they just spoke the truth
and
that
is something that is
that
quite frankly it is it is beautiful it
would be to see someone like that
and encounter them because i could talk
to them day and night i know you can
that that kind of person but you just
everyone's you know
institutionalized by society mo
and and when you read do you still read
things from people like that you know i
really don't read much anymore but if i
do pick up a book yes it is along the
lines of some of those rare
um writings of
you know titles of a you know the title
of a book which would almost sounds
absurd um but that's those are the kind
of things that
if i am to read that i that i would pick
up but i
you know reading for me is um
you know it
nothing reveals the truth you know
uh
believe me if someone if someone talked
about the direct truth about things and
didn't prescribe
i would read all their books i believe
me i would i i
i would i would long for such things
but
it just doesn't you're just
you know i live in i live in the wrong
era
i guess
well
yeah
for sure right you live in it yeah
little too happy how about we leave it
like that right you live in a different
era
well the the things that interesting the
things that i'm interested in
um
are are so
are so completely
you know way out there and so anti
everything this is like you know i look
outside the window and i see this is
just this plastic society in which i'm
just just been placed here in this in
this in this this purgatory and it's you
know it's like
there's there's no sense of belonging to
to this every the music that i hear and
the words that are spoken and the
the culture of sports and business and
life and the neon lights and the news
and the televisions and the radio i
don't listen to the television i listen
to the radio i you know i i live this
monk-like existence in the you know like
a hermit staying away from
everything it's almost like a
you know it's almost like waterboarding
in a way it's it's it's you're placed
into an environment
to which you do not fundamentally and
intrinsically belong
but you still have to water the seeds
that are your two young boys because i
know you they're your pride and joy
right like do you th those things get
those seeds get watered
by by them just observing you i don't
think it's about them observing anything
i'd say those seeds get watered
when you yourself
are genuinely and non-prescriptively
on a search for truth about you and your
own life
and whatever if anything's going to get
watered it's going to get watered
through sincerity and genuineness it's
not going to get watered
uh through
prescriptions and teaching and advice
and all of these things y'all you never
ever i'm curious
is this time of year any different for
you than than any other like do you do
anything out of the ordinary
no
no
do you have no saying do you ever take a
step back and reflect or set goals or i
know you laugh at people who do these
resolutions but is that part of your
life at all
no
so how do you think about the future
that's in me 365 thing that isn't a new
year thing
i mean to evaluate
you know to evaluate the essence of
things
um it isn't according to some calendar
year made by man you know that's that's
that's my whole life
i i know it is so how do you how do you
think about the future or do you well
the future is created by the present
and so the
the more
definitively
you can discover things now
then that takes care of the future
you're not sitting there thinking
you know in the next 12 months
here's the two or three areas of
improvement that i want to get really
well i can get better at improving
improvement and bitterness is a it's a
falsehood that's that doesn't go
anywhere and that's just
circles
i have no interest in improving or
getting better at anything
there's only an arrival either here
there or not wherever that there happens
to be for you there's no intermediary
there's no middle ground there's no
there's no progress chart
was there a particular arrival in the
past year or so that uh you felt like
you achieved
no i don't look at things that way to me
it to me it's just the ultimate arrival
you know i'm not looking for small goals
and small
milestones and and those kind of things
it it you know it's very hard to answer
questions about what i do because i
don't know what i do and i don't
remember what i did and there's no
there's no like
there's no like plan you know it's just
it's just a
full force um unrelenting
deep dive into the truth about things uh
there's no step-by-step
thing and by this data i want to achieve
this it though
i don't
really have
much interest in those things
achievements and all these things
well i think that i i wasn't joking when
i said i think at some point it'd be
fascinating to have
one of these streaming services just
have a camera around you 24 7 and do a
documentary to figure out how the hell
they get in your head
but we'll save that for another day
i want to reflect on i want to take some
time and reflect on some issues that i
learned from people who listen to our
podcasts this year and i want to dig a
little deeper into areas that i think
our listeners are most interested in
there seems to be a lot of
misunderstanding about a truth or
the truth what the truth really is
i know it's personal for each of us
when do you know that you found it
well it's a feeling you know you found
it it's a feeling
and you know the truth isn't isn't it's
an it isn't
a
a a fact or a nugget that you go out to
find it is
everyone is
suffering through various things
everyone is pursuing various things in
their life and the things that mean most
to them whatever it may be be it their
profession or be it in their personal
life or be it
anxiety or or becoming world number one
and whatever it may be and and each of
those things has a truth
it has a truth
that is
indivisible incontrovertible it is hard
rock basement
truth
um the source from which
that
anxiety let's say arises or the source
from which that world number one comes
from there's a truth
and
if it isn't a truth it's a chase
so that's what truth means that there
there is there is a there is a way and
the way is never a method i i
i hesitate to use the word way because
people people misconstrue that um a way
isn't a method
it means that there is literally a truth
as to the way to get somewhere but that
is never
mythological or technique based
uh or prescriptive
so it is about hunting for
what is
the real truth
about
where i want to go what the source of my
wanting to go there is
is it pure is it not what is the truth
of whether i chase
purity as a prescription to follow or if
i am
chasing purity because purity is really
really connects deeply with me
there's a truth behind all those things
there's an honesty there is a
genuineness
that's what is meant by truth truth
isn't about discovering a bunch of facts
or a bunch of knowledge
it is it is a wholehearted
uh pursuit of the essence and the true
cause
of the effect that one seeks
and is that
are you regardless of what it is that
people are seeking whether it is like
you said to be world number one or to to
be the best leader that they can
are we talking about really
understanding what it takes by drilling
deep and asking ourselves questions
and that's when that feeling is going to
arise
but
first part yes second part no the first
part about asking questions and really
examining the source
of one's desires yes but then you said
is that how the feeling is going to
arise well as soon as you ask that
question now it becomes prescriptive
because now what you're saying
is so if i if i do that then i'm
promised that a feeling will arrive so
let me do that and then wait by the
phone and then hope for the feeling it
doesn't work that way so that's where
everything falls apart is if you're
doing it to get something um
it the the pursuit
is
the reward
not and i don't mean the journey as a
reward it's not what i mean
the
because the pursuit is to get somewhere
the pursuit isn't just to go on the
pursuit
the pursuit is to get somewhere
and to arrive
so
that is its reward because one
one will find it if that pursuit is pure
so but it isn't that okay so if i do
this then
then i've been promised that a feeling
is going to arrive well that's that just
falls apart
so for truth is to to become world
number one
and i do
get to that arrival right does the
question now become
what do i do to stay there to sustain
that excellence it depends it depends
what resonates with someone you know for
one person it may be that i just want to
get there and now having got here that's
it that's what i wanted to do on my life
and now i've achieved it
for another person it might be well i
want to i want to become the greatest of
all time i want to remain in this spot
forever so
whatever
whatever speaks to someone then that
dictates where they go from there and
it's continual self-examination is that
what we're talking about that's a
dangerous word i mean i'm hesitant of
any person mentioning any word because i
know where they're coming from they're
always coming from a prescription
and so i would say no no
self-examination i know i know what you
mean by that you know if if if there was
a person in front of me
who
who i had completely
understood and it was it was
undeniably clear
that his was the genuine search for
truth he's the real deal he's all in he
is totally devoted he has devoted his
life to it and if that was clear then
that person can use self-awareness he
can use
whatever word he wants and he won't be
in trouble because i know where he's
coming from
but anyone else i know where they're
coming from they're coming from
prescriptions so my answer is no even
though it's the exact same word
i know the spirit in which the question
is being asked therefore the answer is
no
so but i get it so let's assume it's
that person let me let me say one more
thing for instance for instance
imagine there's a there's a monk in
tibet who wants to live in a cave
and it's 40
below
right
and and he wants to
remain
warm in that environment well
he can cultivate tumo okay so tumor was
a type of meditation in which you can
generate internal heat
now so if that person given
given what his
desire is that it's that okay it's very
practical it's very here and now i'm i'm
in the mountains i'm in a cave and i'm
going to do meditation to develop tumor
to increase my body heat so i can
survive fine
that person can use the word meditation
all day long i have no problem if
anybody else uses meditation the answer
is no before the i know where they're
going i know where they're going they're
doing the 20 minutes a day crap and i
know it's nonsense so so no so you can't
use that word i mean for me that's
complete false i know where you're
coming from and it's nonsense okay so so
so let me so let me take it this way
then because we've also talked a lot
about and you write a lot about
understanding right before any of us are
able to rise above anything or to get to
that level we must first gain that depth
of understanding and that starts with
the kinds of questions we're asking
ourselves to get there give me a sense
of the type of questions that that
person sitting in front of you who got
to to that world number one what type of
questions should he be asking himself
what what is it that i have not realized
what what what is a chase that i am
going on
that i have not recognized is a
fruitless chase
those are questions that human beings do
not ask
no they don't
yeah they don't they they ask how do i
get there what is the quickest way
to
um to follow my dream what is the
five-step plan to this
what is a good methodology to do this do
you have any techniques that i could do
this
how do i come about how do i stop
thinking
this is just nonsense questions
yeah absolutely especially serious time
of year yes well it doesn't well yeah
but
they're all yeah this time of the year
in fact in that sense
new year's a total waste because it
makes people go on more chases of new
year's resolutions
yeah i i absolutely see that
so when we when we're at that stage
right and and some people call it no
mind you've written about the state of
no mind and so forth i know the way that
you understand it or that you've helped
me understand it is that to get to that
no mind state there you have to go
through the proper channels or it has to
come through you
is that the heart is that what you're
talking is that another feeling that
that one of us gets when
we're at that well let's talk about the
truth what is the truth why do you want
to get to know mind
that's more of a truth
the reason that most want to get to know
mind is because they want to experience
the wonderful experience of no mind it's
a chase
or get rid of the that goes on
in my mind 24 7.
well that's a chase too
you're not going to outrun those things
so the only people that the only reason
they want these things is because they
chase experiences
they want to have the lovely experience
of a spiritual experience and where
there's no thought and their
consciousness and all is one and
beautiful love love love and they're all
full of crap
that is not real that is not genuine
that is not that is not true
no mind is a natural side effect
and i hesitate about any person who
comes and asks me how do i get to know
mind it's like asking me how do i
make a million dollars
it's a chase
therefore it's not worthy of a response
so you don't see it as a worthy
as a worthy journey for somebody to to
try to at least minimize
it it goes on in there
no no minimizing is useless either
you're going to get there or you're not
i'm not interested in help or betterment
or i'm a little bit better than this
than i was last year i'm a little less
angry now i'm not saying people should
look at it that way i'm just telling you
the way that i look at it i have no
interest in self-help
i view things as either it's ultimate or
it's nothing
if if if i can't have it permanently i
don't want it
yeah so and you and i have talked about
that before we've talked about the fact
that hey you take an athlete for example
you know who's who's thrives in pressure
situations whether it's 18th green on a
sunday afternoon or whatever
um
is that person
completely detached or disidentified
from their mind is that what they're is
that how they're approaching that last
shot on that 18th green or do you not
look at it that way
um
no i mean it's true that athletes
you know they fall into so-called zone
they do fall into those things
and you know no mind states do find
people and
most people have experienced them
um so what's the question the question
isn't
um how do you not see that as as is that
is that not considered in that no mind
zone is that not in the thinking zone
i'm just in there and i'm gonna just you
know i am completely detached from my
thinking i'm focused on this pot
no no because you can't talk someone
into it
you have to understand what makes
the mind go in the circles that it does
and you have to understand
why the mind speaks and you have to
understand how the mind reacts in
particular situations
what excites it what subdues it
and in order to understand these things
you have to be of the dna
to want to devote yourself to truly
learning about them
so that you can
you can arrive in those places on demand
it isn't so performance is not not about
helping someone perform that that
i think that's a fundamental
uh
falsehood
of a pursuit and that's where everyone
goes wrong they try to help someone
perform better that is not the point
because
that's just band-aids
it isn't about helping someone perform
better
it is about understanding the source of
performance
it's about understanding the patterns of
the mind
it is a deep dive into the truth about
where these things arise from
it isn't about what things can we
manipulate what thoughts can i place
into your head that might boost your
performance who cares that's such a
menial pursuit
it's about ownership it's about arriving
so when when so so you just triggered
something i mean obviously as human
beings we all have limitations and those
are the things that we're continually
examining
is there i mean for you personally what
do you do to determine the ones that are
that are most standing in your way so if
i'm asking myself a question what is
preventing me from
moving from number three to number one
you know
it's probably a whole bunch of things
is there an approach for you to think
about hey let me tackle this thing first
um
first of all that's a question
that
people don't really ask what is
preventing me they usually ask the
opposite
of how do i you've taught me well
okay
so
what is preventing the person
is
a
lack of sufficient examination into what
is preventing him
that's what is preventing him
so can you give me an example
well for instance
um
there's fear in becoming world number
one for instance
that could be one of the
one of the barriers
see there's in not
in looking for
the method
[Music]
one becomes blind to the way
and one becomes blind to the way
because in looking for the method
he becomes blind to the things that are
standing in his way
so what prevents someone from going from
here to there
isn't that he doesn't know how
it is that he is being blocked from
getting there
so it is about removing the blockages
not creating a technique
part of moving that blockages is that
learning how to or becoming
uh
attuned to some of the things that we're
attached to
no learning the blockages is seeing the
blockages
so fear see an example is that what
you're talking about seeing the block
whatever the block happens to be
seeing the blockages
one has to be looking for the blockages
and that's part of the whole questioning
process
yeah that's the direction in which
the truth is found
it's not it's not found in the direction
of how
it's found it's found in the direction
of why am i not
it's found in that direction
it's not down in the direction of how do
i
when you talk about legend and or
legends
um i know it's about sincerity i know
it's about
you know purity and devotion but in your
eyes
what makes one
the desire to become one
and just can it just that constant quest
to become one it doesn't have to be
constant it's got to be deep
where one goes
is a function
of how deeply he longs to get there
and how serious he is
to getting there
everything else is secondary
[Music]
and i know you don't give them any
answers right but but when when that
conversation continues and you can see
that they're really dead serious about
that pursuit of legendary do you just
have what do you do to help them
start to formulate that thinking in
order to try to get closer to that
there's no doing it's whatever happens
happens spontaneously
whatever one is ready to hear
he will hear when he's ready to hear it
and i will speak it when i feel like
he's ready to hear it
there i i don't
i don't dump the kitchen sink because
it's useless to do so
it's
a person has to be ready to hear a
certain level of truth
otherwise it'll short-circuit your brain
literally it does people
um
you know
truth can be harmful to your health
i mean uh not especially yours no i mean
that because
because i don't
sugarcoat things you know i state truths
raw
um and
i i i mean that most literally i mean
there can be an adverse effect to
knowing a truth that you are not ready
to hear
on a biological level i mean
it literally people have
very significant reactions to these
things
um partly because
something inside of them recognizes that
it's true
but their
mind um is not ready to hear that and
therefore their takes place place and
sort of in in internal combustion and an
internal war takes place yeah well
you've shared a bunch with me personally
and i've we've acknowledged it here on
this podcast kapil does it surprise you
that the overwhelming majority of people
don't know what they genuinely want
no why would they
what what causes that
well i mean if you are if or
if you work let's say that you work
so let's say that you're awake
from
7am to let's say 9pm
right so you're awake for 14 hours
[Music]
so
the
remainder of the 10 hours you're
sleeping
right
so for those 14 hours let's say
you're locked in your cubicle
or you're locked
in an office or you're locked wherever
okay
and
you're working
how can you know anything besides your
work
why would you
if you are preoccupied
in a certain mode in a certain way of
looking at the world
in a certain pattern of thinking in a
certain pattern of belief
why would you be expected to know
something way over here
because i have one life to live
and if the majority of my time i'm at
work doing something that i hate
or that i'm not engaged in at some point
i probably should examine that
well there's no i'm asking i'm i'm
telling you
what happens i mean you you it's the
reality for you
so so it's it's
there's no judgment here there's no
you should turn around and look the
other way i'm not saying that i'm simply
answering your question
why is it that most people don't know
what they want and my response is why
should they
if you are preoccupied by x and y
and you are not preoccupied by looking
into what exactly it is that you want
why would you know what you want
there's no should there's no should
there i'm just making a plain black and
white statement of fact
so how do you define work
well
you're misa you're missing the whole
point
by work i am saying preoccupation
if your total attention
is towards everything except
looking into
what it is that you want
out of life
[Music]
why would you know
what you want out of life
i think it's a fundamental it's a
fundamental human responsibility to
at least at some point
have meaning i don't i don't i don't
care at some point i'm just saying i'm
just answering the question why people
don't know what they want
the reason they don't know what they
want is there's no reason for them to
know because they never look there
but that there's no should look there
i'm saying that's just why
you talked last time we talked a little
bit about
you know and you brought it up here
sometimes that that fear gets in the way
of a lot of things and you know we were
talking about fear of failure and you
kind of jolted me by saying well no
maybe perhaps it's fear of success and
we went down that road
what triggers fear in people
again i know it's personal
but what is it that desire desire
triggers fear
wanting things
yeah
whether it's desire there must be fear
i get the fact that fear is triggered by
desire i get the fact that fear is
triggered by things that we want that
that for whatever reason seem to uh seem
to be far away so the idea is we hold on
to that desire when in fact if we let go
of that desire no there's no
if we let go no you're going
prescriptive on me again
there's no come on what do you mean if
we let go of the desire
what
there's as if you're gonna turn off a
switch and let go of all you're not
being serious moe what do you mean if
you let if all of you listening let go
of all your desires
you will be free of fear okay
let's all get together in town square
tonight and let go of all our desire oh
come on this is not
you know this is not a a weekly journal
let's let's talk serious come on i mean
if you don't try to help people
what what prevents us from detaching
from things
well
it isn't about detaching
it is about
learning about the perils of attachment
on a very very personal level
once someone becomes
so overwhelmed
and
indescribably stricken
by something
to where they can't take it anymore
then the possibility of going a
different way
uh arises
until that point is reached it's all
philosophical
you've and you feel very strongly that
transformation in its true essence can
be achieved
by anyone who's serious enough to go do
it
um
i am convinced
that
the person
who is hell-bent on transforming
will not need to wait for me to say
whether it's possible or not
if you ask a question
like
do you believe the transformation is
really possible my saying yes isn't
going to do jack for anybody
because the person if i say no
then the person
who says
oh the answer is no okay i guess that
won't transform
that person never wanted it anyways so
he was gonna get it anyways
if the person who listens and says oh he
said yes so now i will go ahead and try
to transform he didn't want it anyways
so it's
it's this whole empty useless motivation
thing
do you really believe that this is
possible yes hooray what's going to
happen nothing
human beings don't respond to this
they're not they're not you know they
respond to inspiration
inspiration isn't given by saying yeses
and nose inspiration isn't given by
saying yes this is possible
if something arises within
one's own heart
which says
this is what i want or he or she sees
someone who has something and has
arrived somewhere and is inspired by
that person and then inspiration rises
with them within them yes
or someone reads something yes
but it doesn't arise from asking a
question which says is this possible yes
or no yes it's possible now i'm inspired
no it's not it doesn't come from that
motivation doesn't work
it might work for a day i agree i
totally agree with that so so it really
so
i
my honest my honest
input to you
is that
the the
coming
through the approach of trying to help
people does not work
it does not work
let's try and do this so that people can
be benefited it's all crap it doesn't
work that way human organisms don't work
that way
they work
they work intrinsically things work from
within
so something on the outside
can spark something within but it's
almost always the something on the
outside that is not trying to make that
person spark from within
it's always incidental
it's always out of the blue
the way that you most affect someone is
when you say something and you don't
even know that you said it but but
something that you said they connected
with
and it was to you insignificant but to
them it made a big splash in their life
things never happened through this neat
and tidy volition and raw raw and this
is the way to do it and yes you can it's
all crap
and and and listen
i see your point so if it's if helping
people
is it is an obstacle or as a challenge
what is a more appropriate way to think
speaking the truth
so is speaking the truth
is is it is learning from others part of
that truth
it depends who the other is
the legends that you're not talking
about not not not just not the 100 books
that we're talking about okay okay so it
depends who it depends
that is learning from others it depends
what you mean by learning
it depends who the others are okay so
even if you satisfy the others by saying
quote the legends fine
if by learning you mean mimicry no
and once again i know where you're
coming from so instead of learning like
oh it's learning from this isn't the
habits of
people who have become a success and
it's nonsense no
can you learn
from another person who legend or not
yes absolutely absolutely
um
but only
if they say something that is genuine
okay so you for example whether you like
to admit it or not for myself and for
others
we learn from you because there is a
level of genuineness there right is that
a a am i
speaking out of school with that is that
interview no i i don't i don't know what
others feel i mean if yeah
they tell me what they feel but that's
fine i mean i i didn't try to instill
that but if if so okay
so your approach is hey well i'm doing
whatever i'm doing because of my own
personal journey yeah so the great
question um
everything that i do
i don't know why i do what i do
um but everything that i do to do do
arises spontaneously and yes it arises
from me from within yes absolutely it is
very personal everything everything
arises from
whatever lives in inside a desire to
find the truth but it isn't done for
a purpose
but is it part of the purpose to find it
to to find to seek and see that truth
for you
sure it is but that isn't
it's a purpose in in that it's a pursuit
so yes i am pursuing it to discover the
truth but it isn't some overall purpose
to help mankind and all this stuff okay
for you so is that why you say
performance is a side effect that if we
performance is a side effect if you try
to perform you will not perform
all great things come from
effortlessness not from effort
yeah that's tough for people to wrap
their arms around what does that have to
do with anything
am i here to make it easy i'm not here
to make it tough i don't care so why
does it matter why do you say that why
do you say that's tough people i don't
so what
so i should not say it then i mean okay
what's the difference whether it's tough
or not who cares what's the difference
there is no difference that's why i
thought that see but the the point that
i'm making is
you said that that's tough three people
wrap their arms around because you view
it from a stand-up standpoint of help
and i view it i do you're right i view
it from the standpoint of stating the
truth everything else be damned
i get it and and i think the thing that
that the real
the real
aha for me during this conversation was
this whole idea of seeking to help
somebody that that desire to help people
that yeah that that's which which is
basically nothing more than ego
and that isn't a bad thing or a good
thing i know your mind's gonna go there
it is not a bad thing or a good thing it
is simply an ineffective thing it is an
empty thing
and for you personally has that has that
ever been
because you've always written you've
always people have always
approached you for advice or counsel or
coaching have you ever had that desire
to help people
um
the more sincere and serious i became
the less of a desire that became
and was it
understanding
that the greatest thing that you could
do for yourself is help yourself and if
others benefit from that great if they
don't that's great too
um
you know it's about
we we all go through different things in
life
we all have various experiences we all
go through
um our own forms of
of trouble and you know life bringing
storms
and uh
and so you you
those become a window
into examining the source from where
such things arise
um
so
everything
is
about
learning the truth about where you are
where you want to go
why such and such has has happened
and
whatever comes from that
by
side effect
that
another
may take something from
it comes
but it's
but if i if i write something and i find
myself trying to
um
help
uh i stop writing
that's not the way
because i know that i've moved
in that moment
i've moved away from uncompromising
truth
and i've moved towards
an egoic
desire to help
and that is not satisfying at all
makes total sense to me let me ask you
two more quick things it seems like the
beginning of of most transformations
that i've seen in people start with a
crisis
what is it about a crisis that always
kind of well these beams do not change
unless there's
they're
standing at the edge of a cliff with a
knife to their throat and a tiger
standing in front of them
that's
human beings are 12th hour creatures
that's just the way it is
can you get to a state where you don't
have to wait for a crisis to continue
that
process that you go through well of
understanding there is no how but if you
find a way then
so be it
when you talk about the truth being
outside of your mind
is that the same as having no mind
or is that that feeling that we
discussed earlier
when you when you get that feeling you
know it's a knowing
yeah so feeling
uh
feeling is sort of a direct
communication
from something deep
um
whatever the mind tells you is a lie
and therefore truth does not exist
within those conversations
do you are you totally detached from
your mind
i'm sure everybody's curious hell i am
you know the mind is the mind means very
little to me
um
the mind
it's
it's voice is
it's the voice of someone i don't want
to hear
but it's but that you know but it's
there right that's that's taken years of
learning about the truth not practice i
didn't practice anything
um
that that takes years of learning about
the truth
to
to be
really that suspicious
of the thoughts
that go on intimately inside your own
head
and part of that truth is that all of
that is
it's all nonsense yes it's all lies
it's all conditioning and it's all
beliefs it's all opinions and it's all
circular
it doesn't go anywhere there's no truth
there it's all
intellectual jargon
and is there a sense of freedom kapio
when you reach that state where you're
at where
you really do disidentify with all that
well there is absolutely a sense of
freedom but the freedom isn't a good
experience
it's just freedom
and and i say that because
you know
so what i mean you the way that you
asked it as if the freedom is gonna feel
good and it's not about that
um
you know it's not about a chase for an
experience
but it's
it's another layer removed
to getting to that truth
freedom from the mind is the ultimate
freedom
and and you're there
it doesn't matter
we're curious man that's all it doesn't
matter it's it's that that's just that's
you know
that's just uh
that's just comparison and competition
you know it's irrelevant it's how long
did you meditate today it's it doesn't
go anywhere it doesn't matter
it's you know where i am and
it that has no impact on your immediate
life there's there's there are issues in
everyone's life that are very immediate
very acute
that
require their attention but your life
devotion to the work that you do on
yourself
whether you like it or not is
inspiration to others
i don't do any work on myself
what do you call it self what do you
call examination well i it doesn't
matter what i call it i'm just saying
that it's not in the vein that you're
sort of putting it
where it's working on myself i don't
work on myself
it is it
you know
it is a it is a direct examination of
the truth about things and that isn't a
different way to say it i don't do any
work i have no rituals i literally i
have no
meditation i have no mindfulness i have
there's no practice
so i literally mean that there's no work
going on here
i know you don't but when you get up and
write you write what comes through you
is your learnings through that writing
that helps you kind of peel away to get
to that truth yes
because they don't call that word that's
just pure no absolutely not there's no
work there's no there's no hammer and
nails going on over here there's no work
it's it happens instantly
it's non-work it happens instantly
it isn't it isn't about what i do it's
where i live
so i live
in that soup
of
uh swimming in an ocean
you know
dissecting truth
but there's no
there's no practice
that that i i'm i'm doing my best to
remove that whole
charade
of penance and practice and ritual and
technique and you must work on yourself
and you must pay the price and you have
to it's none of that stuff it's none of
that effortful stuff and face the things
that you don't like and
it's that's all just crap
listen all the problems that you that
you have right anxiety
fear pain failure whatever it is worry
all about right all that right did you
work to get those
of course not okay
so if you didn't work to get them
why would you have to work to get rid of
them
that's what we need to get a better
understanding of it's the it's part of
the conditioning it's it's kind of
the depth that you
have talked about or at least helped me
understand this whole notion of
disconnecting from my mind is not
something that i'm gonna capture it's
this thing that is available to me that
i gotta access
and that's
you know that that's
that's what i'm trying to understand
i understand
i appreciate it man always
no better way for me to start my year yo
gupta how are you really well how's the
week going things every week there's got
to be interesting things going on man
let me at least enlighten me a little
bit what's the most interesting thing
that happened to you over the last
couple of weeks
just the uh
the solidification of the fact that uh
isolation is so critical in this world
why because we i mean our minds get
polluted by the environment and the
people around us
but for you what is it that that really
right polluted by interaction minds get
booted by interaction because
with interaction comes posturing with
interaction comes
uh
you know sending forth one's a
self-image as a surrogate
and you know the
that that creates the influx of ego and
that creates for the complication
um
i think
when a person is isolated there there
are
there's enough of a complexity in the
form of self-image and ego
to keep one occupied for the rest of his
life without having to
um
you know bring
more complexity into the prey
how do you how does that stuff not
affect you how does that the poison
of the thinking of other people and i'm
with all due respect to some of these
other people but i'm just saying in
general how do you not let that impact
you
i don't think it's about letting or not
letting i think it's i think it's really
it's all internal
it's all looking inside yourself
and
um
it is the
it is the no matter what your what
pursuit you're involved in your level of
devotion becomes tested
and um
the more your level of devotion
naturally and organically is in
something
then that is what will keep you from
sort of entering into
um
complexities
which if that devotion is not naturally
strong
you will succumb
well it it i want to i want to pick up
on a couple things that i learned from
you over the past couple weeks if you're
going to share anything interesting a
couple things that i learned from you
from
your discourses and tweets and so forth
that i want to dig a little bit deeper
into it the first one
is so apropos for the world we live in
today when you talk about the difference
between clarity versus doubt and i want
to read the tweet and ask you a question
about it
if one is driven by the hope of reward
and the pleasure of favorable outcomes
he will be stricken by self-doubt
if he is at all times self-honest about
the purity of his motivations his
decisions and his actions will arise
from clarity
that's beautiful
dig into that for me a little bit i know
it's about
not thinking about outcomes but i want
to explore that a little bit with you i
never said it was not thinking about
outcome that's a sports psychology thing
that's cosmetic nonsense it is not about
not thinking about outcome that that
basically means that you're forcing
yourself
not to think about outcomes that's where
everyone lives in the prescription world
it has nothing to do with that it is an
understanding
that something that is chased for the
reward um is absolutely if you chase
something for a reward
first it must be cemented in your mind
with you know hammers and nails
that that is not bad
and i think that
there's no point in talking to any human
being unless they first get past the
idea of good and bad because if they
can't get past good and bad then
whatever you say will be colored by that
lens and therefore they will be running
away from bad and running towards good
and game's over
so there's nothing whatsoever i can't
emphasize that enough it has nothing
whatsoever to stop thinking about
outcomes that is prescription and that
is garbage it has everything to do with
understanding
that if you chase something that that
thing will run from you if you chase
something that means that you are
chasing for reward and once again that
is not bad and it is not wrong and it is
not criminal and it is not breaking the
rule it is just about the effect so if i
throw water on you and you get wet that
isn't bad and that isn't good it is just
the effect and the effect of chasing
something for pleasure
um will create self-doubt and the effect
of chasing something or not even chasing
it but pursuing something
um for a genuine motivation and the
purity of
arriving at that thing whatever it may
be for the thing itself is not good
it is just that that the effect of that
will be
clarity
so if you were going into i don't want
to relate it to sports in a minute but
if you're going into an important
business meeting
where
it's really critical that you raise a
round of funding to keep your business
going
what is your mindset like going into
that business meeting
well
you're already
you're already compromised
if you go in
under the weight of need
it is not about the how
it is
if you have nothing and you go in
because you really need something
uh you will
your effectiveness will be limited
so which would how are you approaching
it then
well
does from whether he's trying to
sell someone on a product
or sell a product or sell someone on an
idea to get funding whatever it may be
you know the the traditional way of
looking at things is that
i need to sell you on this and
what is
what is entirely overlooked is that it
has nothing to do with selling someone
else
it has everything to do with selling
your spell on yourself
and
if the if what you're
touting
is
of limited effectiveness or it's of not
very high quality or of limited quality
then
something inside you will not be sold on
it
and when something is not inside you is
not sold on it
then
that will be that will be you will be
limited in how well you can sell someone
else on it
so within the context of sports we're
we're recording this on the weekend of
the super bowl and you get a lot of
these athletes who
are talking about hey i'm gonna approach
this just like it's another game
you and i know that that's
if if you if one of these athletes
is a friend of yours and you're talking
to him
about
approaching
that game how are they approaching how
are you talking to him about approaching
the super bowl
it's not about the approach it's not
about the approach
i'm not going to tell him how to
approach it
however he approaches it
it's it's what he wants to learn does he
want to learn or not
so are you thinking about winning
it's not about what i'm thinking about
it's not about me
listen what
mo there's so many things
that
um
there are so many things that are
understood like if we're standing in a
room there's walls there's
sure there's paint right there's a
ceiling
now
any answer that i give
is based upon the assumption that
there's wall there's carpet there's
painting there's paint there's a ceiling
right
but there's so many answers that require
you to understand
that there is no paint and there is no
wall there is no ceiling where do i
begin
right and so that's why
some of these questions are
very difficult to to get across because
the understandings that are so assumed
and not even questioned because they're
so part of the furniture and the fabric
that
it where
it's where do you begin
so
it isn't for me to answer your question
outright i would have to assume the same
thing that you assume sure and get it
and the assumptions are
the assumptions that are assumed before
the question is even asked are not true
so the question is like comes later
first the assumptions that you not even
haven't even mentioned
those are what needs to be challenged so
it has nothing to do with
what would i tell him what would be my
mindset what would i want to do
if this is what this is what you have to
understand
if
the guy said
i'm going to approach this as if it was
a super bowl
you know what the answer is okay
if the guy says i'm gonna approach this
like it was any other game you know what
the answer is okay
okay so
there's no no you shouldn't approach at
that no that doesn't work
if the person said
i'm not sure how to approach this
and
i really want to approach it the most
effective way
can we have a discussion about you know
what this really means and and how
how the effect of approaching in one way
causes this and the effect of
approaching a different way causes it
that way
now we can have a conversation
with advice
let's go there and here's here's the
real purpose of me asking the question
there is such external pressure on a lot
of these athletes to win the game
and some it's very difficult
for people
not to scum to that external pressure
and still kind of maintain that internal
desire to be the best so
kind of advice are you giving them
you have to filter things through your
own dna
and through your own
the the according to what resonates with
you some people if they approach it
through the lens of this is a super bowl
they
it it creates a greater degree of
motivation within them
another person
if he approaches it the same way
it creates a greater degree of pressure
within them
so
it isn't about
advice it depends upon
you have to break down the individual
and find out
what is it about him you know what
inspires him how was he made
and that dictates the direction that he
goes
so you and i talk a lot about and i know
you talk about
the idea of
giving yourself permission
to be great
so in your work with with
others and most importantly with
yourself what prevents people from
giving themselves that permission or
that opportunity to be great
the lack of desire to want to be great
so do most of us lie to ourselves when
we say hey of course i want to be great
well the same way that they lie to
themselves well
it's not lie it's the same way
it's the same way as the person who says
i would love to have 10 million dollars
he's not lying
but it's very different from a person
who says well i'm going to go create you
know the world's greatest company and 10
million dollars is going to come from
that there's different things there's
want and there's want
so
i think i think any
conversation that is centered around the
masses and people
is a fruitless conversation it's
catering to the lowest common
denominator and the lowest common
denominator shouldn't be the part of any
conversation
so when you think about the great
artists that you admire
what is it that you admire about them
draw
desire hunger
devotion
dna
it's always going to be the same answer
it doesn't matter the craft
so if i don't have a dna and i do have
that
if you don't have the hunger forget it
go home you know i don't care how many
books you read you can read all the
habits of you know wealthy people or
whatever you want to read all day long
you can literally hear one that's right
they're wealthy people
you can wear 14
a day i don't care what you do you're
not going to get there you're not
because you don't have the dna for it
and dna is not genetic the dna is
the dna of having a desire
this is about this this is about world
number ones this is people who want to
conquer their mind it's about people who
this is not about the common man i don't
care about the common man
the whole world succumbs and bows at the
feet of the common man i do not i am not
interested it is boring to me
i don't want to help anybody i'm not
interested if this helps anybody
the person the person who is ready and
right will automatically get helped
uh autumn okay i know those are the
people i want to talk to
let's talk about from the 8 to 11.
are they interested in learn how about
let's answer that very few
okay the 8 to 11 so the 8 to 11 even in
those there's a very small number who
have the dna but since they're already
in eight they they have the eligibility
requirements okay
good good good right right so um so
there's a there's a pot listen moe you
know
it's sort of making light of it but you
know
i don't think that
it's understood
um
just
how much human beings have been
conditioned to be average and you're
going to say that you do know and you
don't the degree to which
human beings are conditioned and have
all the talent and possibility and
potential sucked out of them by a
certain age is astronomical sure it is
virus it's a virus society is a virus
and it is because it is precisely
because it caters to the lowest common
denominator that it breeds them
i agree
i agree and every time you and i talk
about that i become a lot more conscious
of it and that's why i asked you the
question about hey how do you distance
your mind when you're politely having a
conversation with a couple of these
people and you don't want to internalize
it because it is poison
yeah i think i think it's about
it's much more about
carrying an umbrella
than it is about stopping the rain
this is about that deep examination that
you're talking about
yeah everything all of the shields that
you have
and all of the um
all of the ways that you had to prevent
yourself from getting tainted and
significantly conditioned
all are from the inside
not
not from you know not from the outside
how would you describe the relationship
that kapil gupta has with himself
constant examination
and is it constant examination of saying
hey here's one here's where my mind
really screwed me today or
is it are you in a neutral frame of mind
as you're doing that examination are you
just learning and understanding
it's it's a constant examination
that arises from a devotion
of
not being affected by the mind
what can can you give me an example of a
recent
situation where you face that
when you um experience a so-called
assault let's see seems that word from
the outs
who you really get assaulted by
you know the arrow may come from the
outside but the wound happens on the
inside and so
a person can get all the arrows he wants
from the outside
but if he spends his life trying to stop
the arrows from the outside he misses
the boat
because
what where the real money is
is to stop the wounds
from happening on the inside
so if someone slaps you once you slap
yourself twice
so if you
if you understand that not
intellectually if you understand that
viscerally
then your efforts will go in the
direction of
the prevention of you slapping yourself
twice then they will in the direction of
having the other person not slap you
and everyone is taught to do the
opposite
[Music]
at this stage in your own
evolution and your own understanding do
you ever get to a point where you feel
at peace
with the quest that you're on for this
deep understanding
yeah you have the most peace
when the things that used to arise don't
arise anymore
that's when you know that something is
is transforming
how do you deal with emotion
emotion is a barometer
emotion
when it
tempers itself then you know that
something is transformed within you i
don't
use it for one thing or not
so you're not it's not for you it's
you you you don't ever get to that place
of anger you don't get to that place of
being self-critical of yourself when you
feel like something didn't go well you
don't go there
all those things arise
it is a matter of the degree to which
they rise and the frequency with which
they arrive
and the situations in which they used to
arrive and no longer arrive
that
that is the
barometer
as opposed to
using them or
um
or
um
you know subduing them
uh it is a is a
is a monitoring of
how much they arose and and how much
they would have arose before
are there particular emotions
that you're less likely
to
respond or react to now that you're at
this place of understanding for yourself
do you ever get derailed
well not knowing the truth about
everything is derailed
you know
so
that constant that constant devotion to
finding the truth it is a derail until
you get there
[Music]
and and when you find yourself stuck for
example somebody was talking to me a
little bit earlier today about
um
a a real complex issue that they're
dealing with at work and they found
themselves stuck and
it was just just being in that room and
feeling the emotion that they had on
people was toxic
when you find yourself dealing with
complex issues for you a lot of times
it's just personal things that you're
digging deep in which way to get to that
truth i want to cut you off because i'm
going to forget what i'm going to say
um the toxicness first of all of your
example is that there's a group that's
the first toxicness yeah it is a group
it's about seven or eight people yeah
yeah but there you go
nothing no truth can come from a group
never never in a hundred million years
never impossible can't happen will not
happen does not happen
um
that's the first toxicity the toxicness
you know as you described isn't that
your emotions are toxic to another
the the
the very group is an assault to begin
with okay because whenever you have a
group there is nothing but intellectual
compromise there is there's posturing
there's ego
and wherever there are those things then
one's devotion is always always where
they can't help it there's there's no
way that it's not going to be that way
it's always to those things
and whatever one's devotions and
allegiance and intention is to that
means it is not in the direction of
truth
so when you're faced with an important
decision as a team how long do you
approach those meetings
no way there's no team each person
each person must be hired painstakingly
as a world-class
rare dna individual to his own
sub-specialty within the group okay
um
and that person has to be
really meticulously brought on board
um and uh
if he is deemed you know the the
the
the genuine um person of knowledge of
that that particular small sub niche
um
as for everyone getting together
and working on one problem you know that
that that works in building a house
that works and lifting a log because
there's so-called teamwork because you
have muscle power for me that's fine but
but but in artistic or intellectual
pursuits
those things
you know
you will have many examples where people
come and say see it worked
what they don't realize is what they
don't realize is
they don't have the other side
to where how well it could have quote
worked if a person who had true
knowledge of that thing was allowed to
do it had
had
free reign to do what he or she wanted
okay that's the only way you can compare
you know no one can say that my life was
great or this or that the only way that
you would know if you're quote right was
if you had two lies
and you did one way you know one life
you did one way
and the other life did the other way
then you compare then you would then you
had a better idea but you only had one
life so you can't compare anything
so everyone likes to make up their own
stories and make themselves feel better
but see it work and look at this and
everyone sees what they want to see and
everyone hears what they want to hear
well is that and and it reminds me of
something you said a couple of weeks ago
where you talk about that the the the
elite
never become elite because of culture
they actually become elite despite the
culture that's what you're referencing
here
uh yeah and group is culture you know
the company a company culture is
you don't have to
have toxic
the
the group itself
is toxic
and that toxicity is limited so long as
each so long as each person is number
one painstakingly brought on board
um very delicately and
after extensive analysis
and then each person is allowed free
reign over their particular domain
because they know it better than anybody
else
so what's the what's the leader's role
in a symphony you don't have the piano
player playing the guitar
right and you have the guitar playing
the saxophone so everyone has to be a an
owner of their particular domain and but
when each one does their thing
to their utmost
then collectively what is heard is a
symphony but if each one
try to play the piano together it
doesn't work
and that that would be akin to all of
them trying to work on one problem
together that problem has a particular
domain that it fits most neatly into
you see rare rare people are rare
and and so when you when you see for
instance you know
friends when you see these documentaries
and you see you know the star of the
entertainer the the superstar athlete or
the the you know the multi-billionaire
ceo whatever it is
and then he goes into a meeting and he
goes in this
super long rectangular table right
there are two it's all the same there
are too many seats at that table okay
you know that table
that table as long as main street
okay
you know
all the main streets across every city
in this country don't have
um as rare dna people
forget at one table
that's what that's what isn't
see the
the degree to which
rareness is rare is not understood
if you if you took all the board room
with the top companies across the entire
world right you might find four people
who have extraordinarily rare dna who
can truly make
the rest of them and and those four
people
unless they have true and free reign
they own the company and they can do
whatever they want typically they reign
with an iron fist which is which is
effective
not democracy and kumbaya all right and
conscious capitalism all this crap right
this nonsense spirituality nonsense this
is a road to mediocrity um
those people are drowned out by the
majority of the mediocre
so this whole world is totally backwards
and the degree to which it is backwards
is unfathomable
so what do you what do you see the role
of a leader today
to be the leader of himself
first
and just let that example be
well
a person who
a person who is
most who has most ownership of himself
and whatever your word is
self-realization ownership
whatever the word is
um
that person's decisions will reflect
that
that person's behaviors will reflect
that
that person's
uh the moves that he makes in the
company will reflect that
everything is a reverberation
of that one center
if that is compromised
then that person will have to will have
no choice but to
um
but to settle for
prescriptions and behavior modifications
and hiring
you know all these these business
coaches to teach them how to behave and
what to say
because there's no center
so would you abolish all meetings if you
were running company x would you not
have meetings with your executives
um if i was the owner of a company and i
truly wanted to create a truly
exceptional company
i would have the least number of
employees i possibly could first of all
um
now where their manpower is required
yeah that's fine it's manpower you can
hire as many of that as you want um
but as far as the decision making
it's
uh it's it's it's all about iron fist
it's all about uncompromised not
compromise
it's all opposite it's all the things
that no one wants to say because it's
not popular it doesn't fit into the
into the lanyard conferences doesn't
sound nice on stage okay so everyone's
looking everyone in this world mode
their allegiance even more than to their
own company is to how they look
everything yeah i agree sure every human
being
is more concerned with how they appear
then they will lose billions before they
compromise how they appear sure that's
how central self-image is
so
so the the real
truths about
the central nature of a human being and
where true decisions come from and where
true success and
and devotion and purity and
effectiveness in any endeavor comes from
there is no one talking about it no one
no one
no one is talking about these things
they're all talking about all the
nonsensical fringe stuff like behavior
change and then that's because no one
has a center so since everyone is blind
they all need 17 seeing eye dogs
well you've shared with me and we've
even obviously shared it on these
podcasts several times about how the
masters are the ones who are spending
their time understanding the true nature
of the game
in this context is it that is the game
the business
within this leadership context is that
what we're talking about in business
obviously yes the game would be the in
sports the game would be the sport but
yes
and as a as so from a leadership
perspective
what am i trying to imagine
in addition to mastering myself
what else do i need to to master in
order to have the type of impact that
you're describing on the people of that
company the few that have you know that
rare dna that work with me
you master yourself what's left
so that's the game
that's the game within the game so the
game would be the business itself for
the pursuit of the sport or the whatever
that that would be the game
and the game within the game
would be the mastery of itself
but but even before you go to the
mastery of the south
even if we stick with the big game for a
minute
it is about understanding what the big
game even is so forget the mastery of
yourself even the big game is not being
understood
everyone is playing according to the
rules that have already been made
everyone is playing in the world of
competition
everyone that's why this parody everyone
is asking the questions that are already
being asked asked
no one's asking new questions
no one's disrupting the game
they are they are
they are entering into the boxing ring
to fight the fight that's already being
fought
and that's why
that's why true
genuine
rare companies and rare legendary
athletes it's rare
it is not a product of lack of talent
or lack on the business world lack of
intellect
it is
it is a product of having fallen hooked
line and center for the culture and not
having understood
your particular game
have you ever had an experience where
you
were in the presence
of an individual that you would call a
master a leader like that who was
surrounded by a few of these lieutenants
who really had that reenacted rare dna
and that desire to seek that
understanding that you're talking about
have you ever experienced that
that type of person is so rare to be to
forget not be conditioned forget we'll
leave that alone but to have
the insight and the longing to
cleanse himself of his conditioning that
dna itself is extraordinarily rare
extraordinarily the culture is too
strong the culture society and the world
and the culture is a very powerful place
it's a it's an unrelenting time it is an
unrelenting tide if you if if you're
having a conversation with a group of
leaders
and they're asking you
how
what your suggestion is
to try to inject that type of thinking
in their at least their key people
how would you what would you talk to
them about what key people the key
people is them who's more than
themselves
i'm asking how do i start to develop a
culture that goes this deep that has
that level of commitment to
understanding you want direct truth yeah
you won't do it because
this hasn't become part of your
dna you will only be doing it second
hand
therefore you can only do it
prescriptively no matter how hard you
try when will you recognize that it is
part of somebody's dna
right now we were talking about you
what can you see tell me i'm let's let's
stick to me uh right now
you would you would hear it from me
and then you would pass it on and i'm
saying that's not going to work
and and believe me a couple of weeks ago
then that hit me between the eyes and i
i i it connected with me right am i
there yet of course not but i'm getting
it you're getting it intellectually but
there's i don't think that's even worth
talking about there's because this is
going to turn into a conversation of
well how can you get that dna no it
won't
okay there's no point there's no point
it's not going to happen in fact i
recommend that no one talk about what i
say to people that they know because
they're going to think it's so off the
wall that it's so antithetical and so
against everything that they know
that they're going to discount it right
at the beginning so i thought to people
to stay quiet much less do the opposite
so
this idea of that you're going to now
impart this to the people it's not a
question of your intelligence or your
or your knowledge or your ability has
nothing to do with that it's it's wiring
man it's wiring it's just how a human
being is naturally wired and it isn't
about getting better at it so that you
can it's not about that it's it has to
come
everything has to come from the horse's
mouth that's why i think it's totally
it's it's frankly male practice
for those
for let's say a person becomes a great
coach let's say a sports coach and then
he
starts an academy and then he has
assistant coaches who teach who teach
his system that's malpractice they can't
teach his system they're just a bunch of
mules all they do is they read his
nonsense and they're going to pass it on
because quite frankly it's never about
the information it's something about the
dna of the giver and if you remove the
giver and all you have is the
information then all you have is snake
skin it doesn't go anywhere it's the
whole package so it's never about past
this information along you know those
people who were mesmerized by jesus they
weren't mesmerized just by his words
because the ten commandments and then
buddha's you know
you know four noble truths and
eightfold path those are all over the
place right in every library and every
every right what are they done they
haven't done anything because it wasn't
about just it wasn't about dumbing down
the concepts and passing it on like a
cheat sheet it was about it was about
the buddha himself it was the package of
him yes him saying those things but
there was something about the himness
right that the packaging of it and and
the the resonance of the voice and and
the um answering the requisite questions
that came um it wasn't just the passing
on of the information which is what
you're asking me and and that's not
going to work when did you personally
recognize
that you're ready yourself to make that
shift to that level of seriousness to
make that shift to be
to to to be that rare master that we're
talking about well because was there
something that happened to you what was
this you know it's a good question i
don't know i mean these these are these
questions about the when i don't know
they don't really go anywhere because no
one really doesn't know the answer um
but you know
i don't even want to say this because
it's going to come across as a
competition because that's that's the
lens through which everyone looks at
things i have never met someone as
devoted and serious as me
and i believe that sure
in these particular things and and and i
will hail from the rooftops but that
isn't a good thing i'm not proud of that
right i don't i don't want a prize for
that that's not great it's nothing and
the reason that there's no prize for me
is because that wasn't my choice it
happened to me it was a chosenness so i
can't take credit these things just came
to me they when i when i have to answer
a question on twitter or to you or to a
client or on the field or in the in a
sticky situation or you know in a on a
you know a critical part of the match
whatever it is i don't go with my own
knowledge it just comes if it didn't
come then i wouldn't be able to answer
questions so rapidly i'm just reciting
i'm not creating but is it a heightened
level of awareness that allows you to
hear these messages or
have these things come through you it is
a heightened level of devotion
seriousness and sincerity and any person
and i'm not the only one there have been
many people who have been sincere and
devoted before me and those people who
are is all the same when you develop and
when you demonstrate a level of
sincerity and seriousness and
genuineness
the universe you you tend to you tend to
prove to the universe that you are a
worthy vessel and things just flow into
you because you have demonstrated that
degree of seriousness sincerity
genuineness devotion purity whatever it
is in that particular domain that's the
way it works and do you find that that
happens
more likely when somebody's dealing with
a really serious crisis that we're our
back is so against the wall that we have
there's no turning back um no i think
that's conflating two things i mean when
someone's back against the wall that is
the situation in which a person does
become serious but he tends to become
serious only for so long as his back is
against the wall and all the promises
that he made that he won't ever do it
again once it's over he will do it again
so this is much more of a long-term
fundamental dna seriousness as opposed
to a situational one
all right so two more things for you and
and we'll just stick on this for a
moment when you yourself are working
with people do you get a sense of when
they're ready i've never met anyone who
had that level of seriousness but there
are but those people absolutely exist as
you can see from you know the the
rembrandts the picassos and the some of
the sports legends that have gone and
you know years and years ago
obviously they exist
absolutely exist and going back to what
we were talking about this whole idea of
permission are we just not we're just as
a society as human beings as people who
are devoted to
thinking that we want to get better
we're just not ready for the truth i
guess well you can't be ready for the
truth if what you want is to get better
what's the alternative arriving at the
ultimate or nothing whatever the
ultimate is for you see everyone has
been everyone has been sold so many bill
of
bills of goods that they don't know
which way is up anymore if you have a
house filled with fourteen thousand
things all those fourteen thousands are
all the bills of goods that society has
sold you so all 14 000 will have to be
jettisoned first and a big bonfire will
have to happen before one you know zeros
himself out to now be ready for the
truth because
what's someone gonna say when they hear
well because you're focused on getting
better you can't be serious you can
never learn the truth that is so
antithetical how is this person i get it
understand that that sounds insane and
and the truth will always sound insane
to someone who believes in society so
what prevents what prevents people from
seeing that truth never having heard
that message you know and most are never
going to have the dna to inculcate that
message but some will
but when the only voice you hear is one
voice which is society's voice
the culture's voice and the motivational
speaker and the priests and the
mindfulness expert and the meditation
instructor and the buddhist and the
christian and whatever
that's all you hear then there really is
very little opportunity except for the
rarest dna guy who know that that's
wrong out of the box okay that's that
guy's you know he's already um open to
knowing that that's wrong or
ineffective um but those who could have
been turned those with the dna to be
turned they're out of luck because
that's the only voice they ever heard
you know my voice is very small though
i'm you know i'm a quarter of a drop of
water compared to the ocean of society
right i mean i'm one person versus you
know 20 million who are spouting the
complete opposite exactly but that's
what i appreciate about you and that's
what
a lot of people who follow you
appreciate the point is the point is
that that you know the very uh the very
possibility of you know everyone hearing
these words is minute it's not going to
happen everyone you know i'm a very
small microphone so so one one last
thing and then we'll kind of pause this
you don't read a whole lot about other
people you don't follow a whole lot of
people you don't listen to the advice of
anybody on this quest of truth for you
do you ever kind of think about
right or wrong or do you just go why
would i think about white as well so you
think it's wrong the way you ask the
question in the tone of your voice and
the way the way that your voice rolls at
a 45 degree angle when the first part is
leveled off hey man i love how you and
you're you make a hell of a play by play
person okay that go ahead that
demonstrates that you think it's wrong
that i don't think of right and wrong
and no i really don't i'm curious a 45
degree angle doesn't happen that isn't a
genuine question that's a comment
masquerading as a question with a
question mark retrofitted on the end of
it um it it
you see why do i think about right and
wrong when when right and wrong is
exactly the barrier well see i didn't
think of that that's why i asked right i
didn't think of that that's defining in
and of itself you just saying that yeah
but it won't go anywhere because you
have to take it on belief and there's no
point in taking it on belief it is
precisely the subscribing to right and
wrong good and bad correct and incorrect
um that keeps one from knowing the truth
all right i've uh too many thoughts
going into my mind so we can uh we can
hit a pause on this one and uh
thank you for uh before we hit record
i was asking you a question and you said
pause and hit record so let's start with
how do you make sense of what's going on
in the world or do you
you know i'm i'm not terribly surprised
um
i'm not talking about predictions or
anything
it's just one
it's
you know the thing that
is most talked about is a thing in
everyone's mind
and if it isn't talked about then it
isn't on everyone's mind because the
terminal is not there so
just look at the look at the overall
state of affairs you know forget the
coronavirus
this
there is nothing but chronovirus
if you look back
if you look back 50 years if you look
back 80 years older
everyone isn't dying of cancer
every you know one you know everyone
doesn't have type 2 diabetes
um everyone isn't
you know this isn't being struck from
anxiety and
pills and psychiatrists on every corner
and
um
the whole
the whole thing is gone
it's all downhill so coronavirus is just
another detail of the degradation of
society
um
the spread
and how that degradation
reveals itself is just details
and this is just a significant detail
i think the big problem i think
once again i told you like don't come to
me if you want to feel better because
those things don't do anything so you
know if someone gives you a few kind
words and it will actually take five
minutes and the sixth minute you're back
to where you are so let's just stop the
nonsense and be serious if you're gonna
be serious be serious if you're not
gonna be serious then just turn on cnn
and go back to that you know it really
it really is not about
how can you say some good words to make
us
feel better
haven't you enough of that it really is
about
talking seriously about what's going on
and your life's in chaos
life's always in chaos
if you didn't have coronavirus is your
life at peace
you know you're
just look at the world the work
coronavirus is just a holding up the
mirror even closer that's all it is um
just what it is
and and do you look at it as
you know and and i really do appreciate
the fact that you say that hey your life
is in chaos whether without the damn
corona virus and this is a mirror
that's exactly right and that's exactly
right i it really is
it isn't about understanding that
message because there is no message
there's no message that
that you should
make sure that you take a look at your
life and see if it's in chaos
you don't have to do that
you don't have to do anything
it's it's if something seeps into your
bones it does if it doesn't it doesn't
there's no message here there's no make
sure that you go and do this there's no
um
there's no ghost saying the prayers
there's there's nothing
there's nothing any message is a farce
it's an attempt to sell someone on an
idea
has just disrupted your life personally
in any ways
i would say no but it doesn't it doesn't
matter like
because there's more there's far more
there's far more fundamental
problems
to focus upon in our lives
you see human beings are media chasers
they they're they're alarmists they
enjoy the alarm they enjoy the drama
they enjoy 24 7 music they enjoy it they
actually enjoy it okay and i'm not
saying that's bad or that's good i'm
saying that's just the nature of the
human mind it's the truth yeah
the human mind looks for distraction
and i'm not saying that a virus
is all distraction that you shouldn't
take precautions and then you
um you know shouldn't do what's
necessary to prevent yourself from
getting infected or
doing it for someone else i'm not saying
that that's practical that's practical
but what bothers what bothers the human
being is practicality what bothers is
the emotional drama and the fear and the
anxiety that's the bothersomeness right
it's not how i have to stay away from
so and so well from that respect
social distancing
is all i've been talking about for the
last seven years
yeah in fact that's what that that's how
we started our conversation last time
yeah so i mean i think you should go on
anyways i mean
socialization is a plague to begin with
you know so
what what are you going to talk about in
your socialization sessions anyways
right you're gonna gossip about this and
you're gonna laugh about that
and nonsense and waste your life away so
it who cares i mean so it isn't about
minimizing coronavirus it isn't about
maximizing it
it's about
you
and
are you serious and do you really want
to have a serious conversation
or do you want to be hysterical do you
want to uh
you're like you know everyone who's
worried about the converse their their
their life is in complete shambles as it
is what's the difference if you're if
you're if your house is collapsed
what's the difference that
um now on top of the collapse
a few twigs fell as well
might as well
well there'll be an avalanche on top of
it what's the difference
it isn't like your house was perfect or
in any semblance of perfect to begin
with right so
the the major issues of our lives are
avoided
by design
because the human mind enjoys
distraction
and the greatest problem is the only pro
and the only problem is your mind
anxiety fear stress
concern worry anger
all of these things even if even if
there wasn't a virus for the next 10 000
years
even if you even if you make even if
every person in the world made three
million dollars a year no
and even and everyone had a ferrari and
everyone all the food they want to eat
fine no world hunger can we take care of
that fight no world hunger real world
thirst
let's get all the kumbayas out let's
take care of it all fine
what's that going to change at the end
of the day you're still going to go home
with your mind
and that is the frontier that no one is
looking at that's so that's what i
appreciate so much about you man is
really is to get to that level of
understanding so do you see that
one needs to be in the state of
desperation
to reach that level of seriousness that
you talked about and a few will probably
emerge from there
but are we at that state
that maybe this public desperation
a few people will emerge and and head in
that seriousness direction that you talk
about
that's a good question i think that
life-threatening events
and
um
you know
very
serious
things
in one's life
oftentimes do have that impact on some
people
um
it doesn't happen on mass no absolutely
not but that's never gonna happen i mean
the second coming could happen every
single day for next week and that
wouldn't happen it's not gonna happen
so but there are those who are always
sort of on the verge of that on the cusp
of that
and they're actually right
um for becoming serious and maybe it's
something like this that makes them so
um but it's a good question does someone
have to be desperate to reach there i
mean there has to be some level of
extremeness of some sort whether it's
extreme desperation whether it's extreme
desire
whether it's extreme
um dissatisfaction with the status quo
there has to be some form of an extreme
um no one no one five steps their way
into this okay this is not gonna be at
your workshop and this is not gonna be
at your mastermind meeting this is not
going to be at your school
luncheon
there has to be an avalanche of
something has to be a hammer across your
head of some sort
for
for one to be shaken out of this reverie
out of this
zombified state
that's not going to come from any
podcast which says
examine your own life make sure that you
i mean all podcasts are just crap i'm
sorry everything is just nonsense
you don't have to apologize to me
yeah
all these dvds youtube channel
everything is just nonsense because
because the very foundation
is
um a non-starter and the reason for that
is to speak truth mode that speed might
be the only place in the world where
truth is being spoken right in this
conversation between me and you
anything is a non-starter if it begins
with the idea to send someone a message
or to help them
because people don't want to be helped
and that isn't a good thing or a bad
thing nobody actually wants to be told
what to do and quite frankly even if
they did and you tell them what to do
they're they're only appreciated that
they were told and then five minutes
later they go back to who they are so in
india you know you have this
long-standing ritual of you know guru is
giving these talks to
literally millions of people in the
audience right and very very
large unimaginable audiences and
everyone in their audience is sitting
cross-legged and shaking they're nodding
their head
and yes and then you know and then what
do they do everyone goes back home and
goes back to their life and then what it
what what always is the criticism that
you hear
oh you listen but you don't act upon it
right that's that's just nonsense
no first of all you have to understand
you cannot condemn people you have to
understand the human psyche why is that
person there they're not there to act
upon it
they're not wrong or right they're not
good or bad they're there because it
gives them some semblance of peace to go
sit in that
lecture hall or whatever it is that
gives them a respite from their mundane
and trauma-filled life
it's it's an escape okay and that isn't
roll around and so
no one's acting upon it because nobody
wants to
if you put what you need is a whole
bunch of rifles right you need a whole
bunch of rifles and aimed at people's
hands
and with the threat of death they might
tell the truth
and the only way to tell the truth is
first if they're forced to be in a
position where they're actually looking
to examine what the truth is they don't
even know why they go
so everyone's a zombie of some type yeah
i agree so let me ask you something i
want to get to the truth in a minute but
you just triggered something um you
talked you wrote something that i know
you don't remember about this whole idea
of turmoil turmoil arrives on its own
accord and it must leave by its own
accord in what way is that accomplished
there's no way that i can answer that
question there's no way that i can say
let me tell you it's it's
it's it's about it's about being thrown
into the water
and then coming out and becoming wet and
then you and then me asking you what do
you feel right now and then you staying
unwet and i ask you what does what mean
you have no way to describe that so what
am i going to say do these things and
you'll be
no my discourses
my
scrolls those things are an ongoing
exposure to a human being
which slowly seeps into the bones
without any effort from themselves and
without any but without a shadow of a
prescription so this is not a um it's
not a five-step plan so can you tell me
how to get that turmoil that's nonsense
no uh i will tell you this turmoil will
leave on its own if there is the
appropriate immersion if there is the
appropriate and systematic and ongoing
and consistent exposure to truth it will
leave on its own
so do you think that that that the few
people who are serious about the truth
are we trying too hard to understand the
notion of the truth is why is that why
it's elusive to the majority of us
um
no i don't think there's a reason i i i
would say my first answer would be
nobody really is interested in the truth
and it's not a good thing or a bad thing
i keep coming back it is not a good
thing or a bad thing it is almost it is
virtually impossible to talk to people
and it isn't the people's fault it's a
sign of its fault
it's because they have become
conditioned to hear what you didn't say
and it's not their fault because
in all cases they're right so for
instance if i say what i just said if i
say um
they don't want to hear the truth they
don't hear that what they hear is
they don't want to hear the truth and
they should okay and they're not wrong
to hear that because that's the only
message being propagated their whole
entire life they are surrounded by
loudspeakers in every direction
even from from the underside everything
is in that vein you should be doing this
and anything that's negative any
anything that's in the in the negative
which says well because you don't do
this the implication absolutely 100 000
is that they're saying that you should
do this and i'm not i'm saying things at
face value but human beings are not
unable to see things at face value
because they've been conditioned to be
prescribed to and that's the only
microphone through which they hear
agreed a thousand percent
so i you know when you think about
the emotional impact obviously that it's
having all people is real i want to ask
you something about the economic impact
the economic impact especially the stock
market impact has really wrecked people
and it's wrecked people
emotionally how do you see that do you
like if that were to happen to you
how do you rationalize that why do you
want to rationalize what do you do to
think about it
what are you
listen what are you asking i'm asking
that if you have experienced
in three or four days
losses
that took you seven years seven years to
accumulate how do you feel about that
what are you asking that's right
[Music]
why are you asking what are you going to
do about it i want you to know what
you're asking you know what you want
because i'm curious i'm really curious
there are people who deal with it and
where are you trying to go
i'll help you
help me go ahead
you're trying to feel good
no i'm really not
really not because it is turmoil to lose
billions of dollars yes
and so the question that you're asking
in all these
euphemistic beat around the bush ways
is
that does not feel good
i'm in turmoil
and i want that anxiety and that feeling
of turmoil to go away so give me a way
to process it
so that i can make sense of it so that i
can temporarily escape that turmoil
that's beautiful question that's a
beautiful question that's a beautiful
question yes
okay and i'm telling you
and i'm telling you
that i don't think that you're ready for
the answer because the answer that i'm
going to give you is it doesn't matter
because before this coronavirus came
along and before
fifty percent of your net worth was
wiped out you had turn one running ways
a hundred percent
one thing for the other
so
your life was not perfect
and that's an understatement
your life was not anything close to
perfect sure are you telling me now i i
i will go along just for kicks but the
guy who says no no
you don't understand every single
morning i wake up totally free i'm at
peace 24 7. there isn't a single ounce
of salt self conflict within me and then
the coronavirus came along and then this
my net worth went down and now i'm in
turmoil and i want to get back to that
perfection that i had or semi semblance
of perfection that i had to listen
finally i'll take that i'll go with that
guy and answer this question okay now
there is a single human being like that
i agree
okay so then that is the real question
right it isn't about the answer it's
about the question the question is not
what do i do about this latest turmoil
the question is
what's what about all the turmoils in
your entire life but you haven't even
examined what the fundament of those
things are and that you're chasing
turmoil after turmoil after turmoil
trying to feel better feel better feel
better and you've been doing that your
entire life how long have you been alive
how long have you been alive and your
entire life you've been trying to feel
better about one turmoil after another
so even if i gave you a magic pill you
felt better
next monday
you have a brand new set of turn words
what are you talking about so this is
not serious
and i have no interest in making anyone
feel better and playing their stupid
game yeah and it makes this makes a hell
of a lot of sense to me
however the relationship that people
have with money supersedes a lot of
things including the relationship they
have with themselves in fact money is
their identity
what do you say to those people
what are you asking when you ask me what
do i say to them i'm curious i'm curious
if one of them if what if you're working
with one of them well what
it isn't about me saying something to
them
i answer the question what do they want
to know right so once again you see mo
and i'm not thinking of anymore but i
love it keep going
you know what's going on here do you see
do you see you are providing a wonderful
display in examination
of just how conditioned
human beings have become
because
the real the
the the
the
foundational question is so
given
that it isn't even mentioned the
foundational question is
setting someone straight how do you make
them uh not feel that way how do you
correct and fix their view how do you
make them feel better
you didn't even ask that but you don't
have to that's you ask the next level up
assuming that that because that's a
given
right so when you asked me what would
you tell the guy who has you you know
who is
basically attached to money that's what
you're asking okay you wanted me to fix
the guy to make him unattached to money
right and the reason that you believe
that is because you believe in shoulds
and prescriptions you believe that he
shouldn't be attached to men and that's
because you believe in good and bad do
you see
do you see the layer like see the
foundation of layers you know i would
say if someone's attached to money
what's the problem if someone's a
heathen what's the problem now if the
person says to me i have a massive
problem this is eating me alive i
genuinely want to win out
different conversation
different conversation
but we live in a society where the
motivational speaker and the priest
right what they're doing is they they
throw confetti on people right
oh you're you're sad here's a good way
to not be sad anymore
let me give you a hack
right
now
in the face with a sledgehammer because
he is the one spreading the corona virus
the corona virus is not about the virus
there's a far bigger chronovirus and
that's called prescription that's that's
ebola times 1000. coronavirus is small
well i mean it obviously
that type of person has to have a
willingness
to let go of what he or she believes
right you know until you're ready to do
that it's hard to take that next step
next level of seriousness that you talk
about well i wouldn't even say it's a
willingness i mean even that's worse i
would say it's an outright desire to do
so and even even even the
even this is really instructive though
because willingness where'd that come
from you came up with the word
willingness that's a very it's a very
revealing word you came up with the word
of willingness
because it reveals that someone doesn't
really want to change and they better
want to change if they want to get
better
that's once again forcing someone out of
where they want to be
based upon the idea that they should
based upon the idea of good and bad
right and wrong
correct and incorrect that's where
willingness comes from did you ever say
they better be willing to eat chocolate
ice cream
no i have it
because there's no good or bad let the
heathen be a heathen leave him alone
no one there is no changing anyone there
is no prescribing
to anyone that is the that is the rule
of society that is the
chaos of society that's that domain the
the the fact of the matter is
whatever
one or two things i might have said that
might have tickled one or two people at
the end of the day well let's be honest
right i got a handful of years to live
who knows maybe i've got a daily i don't
know it doesn't really matter
but most of my most of my insights are
gonna die with me
and my insights in truth are not even my
own they just came they just came
they came from because their desire to
learn the truth is
astronomical but even that came so none
of it is
self-created but i didn't create that
but the number of people who really want
who really want
this level it's it's it's
extraordinarily small and that isn't a
bad thing or a good thing it's just the
state of affairs so honesty is staying
the way things are
not the way that they should be
right so i'm trying to discover ways to
get out of my own way right trying to
discover ways so you know i can identify
those that those immersive things that i
also tried to get out of my own mind
i'll tell you why what
tell me
you don't want to
and no i did not say that you should
you still want to but i do
no you don't but i do
okay pretend that
no listen listen
if i put a camera on you
right
and i watch you and i and i
and i watch the video footage every
night
okay
would i see a person
who all day is immersed in trying to get
out of his own way probably not no
so that means you don't want it
but you're wrong
and i must and must have heard
that i did not imply in
clouds are white the sky is blue
clouds shouldn't be black and this fly
shouldn't be red the sky is blue
clouds are white moe does not want to
get out of his own way and moe is not a
bad person for doing so
mode is not
unself development motivated for being
that's just where you are
you don't want to get out of your own
way
there's a very very very huge massive
fundamental tidal rate of difference
mode
between want and would be nice if
okay sure i get it
so the guy who really wants to let's say
you know for a company
yeah i agree so all things
begin and end with
maniacal desire
and the thing that you want in your life
are precisely the things that you
already have
you know how i know that
because
all right so i'm trying to process that
however
assume for a moment with me
that
i have a job
right i have a job and i work 10 hours a
day and so forth and so on and i really
do have a deep level of commitment
to try to get to this truth that we talk
about right it may not be 24 7
but it may be you know something that's
that i have a deep level of awareness of
why would why would you look at that as
something that hey i'm not ready for
that what would cause you to think that
despite the fact that i'm not committed
24 7 to it
uh i'm not ready to kind of to reveal
that person that uh
you know that that the truth reveals
because there is something that everyone
is ready for
and that something is what they do 24 7.
and is it doable when you actually have
to get up and go to work every day for
10 hours a day
would you consider that part of the 24 7
or do you have to abandon that
nothing is doing nothing is doable
it is only
only the things that you have no choice
but to do or do
everything else is not do
there is something in your life that you
do 24 hours a day
without without counting the hours
there are things in your life that you
do without even thinking every single
day every single night
we never say is it doable to do that
you only say is it doable to do things
that you don't really want to do
if i if i put a bunch of money
in
an undisclosed location
and you have a meeting at five o'clock
and i tell you i left you a whole bunch
of mine
but it's only available at five o'clock
are you gonna and you're and you're
and you're hungry for money
you're starving and you need money
are you gonna say is it doable
to get there five o'clock of course not
okay so that's my point
you only ask the doable and
so when you think about so so basically
we're all telling ourselves stories
right and those stories are validating
uh that we need to stay we need to stay
in the
kind of on the path that we're on right
now as opposed to be completely abandon
that let go of that and head
towards the truth
and
is it that desperation then that we're
not we don't have
well only if the desire for that is
there there there's
there's no like i'm on this path and i
need to let go of this and go for the
truth no
no that's prescriptive
if the desire
overwhelms the person to go for the
truth
then they'll automatically move in that
direction
if they do it because they should
it's it's a waste of time
yeah i agree i do agree that it's a
waste of time right but but again as as
we've talked about in the past
there's that's getting in the way
that for whatever reason either we don't
want to face or we can't identify or
both
right and perhaps we haven't reached
that level of desire
to look deeper or to get into that
immersive phase that you're talking
about that would allow us to at least
get a window into that and try to
understand it
well i'm not talking about phase
i'm not talking about getting to some
stage or some level
i'm saying
that everyone is obsessed with something
and the only thing that they will get in
their life
consistently
is the thing that they're obsessed with
your obsession is truth
you know
it is
yeah
that isn't that is a good thing
you know
that's not that's not
good and positive
but in your life i didn't choose that
right that
it was it was a chosen
i never chose that i never
i never sat down with the guidance
counselor
and said what would be good and fit my
personality type what a budget crap
effect
that's an insult to a human organism
no one chooses anything
we are chosen and for for for the for
those people kapil
who
aspire to be chosen
at some point are they just gonna
feel it do they choose themselves do we
do we make a decision
to kill off the past and move in a
different direction
if the aspiration is that strong then
they will not wait to be chosen
if the aspiration is that strong they've
already been chosen
yeah i guess i guess that that's what
separates
it's all about self-honesty
and the reason
and it's not it's not human being's
fault they're not
it's not
it's that
society has condemned them
which prevents them from being
self-honest
because if a person says
you know i'm
you know i
you know
i
i don't uh think before i act fine okay
society and they've internalized society
which is the mind the mind is an
internalized society that's what the
mind is
okay
i'm down upon them and say
well you should always think before you
act
that's totally wrong how can you don't
think before do you know how much pain
you have caused by not thinking before
you act but here's five steps from now
on make sure that you do it and then
when you don't do it because and see i
gave you a way to do it and you didn't
even follow through
you're just you're just bad
right
so
when that is the
environment
when that is the micro environment
and it's all based upon good or bad when
the human being is in prison forever
he is imprisoned by the guillotine
of badness
he is on the hook to become good
and therefore he will follow any
prescription
which gives him the self-confidence even
in his own eyes of being a good person
and that is why he will not be
self-honest
including
including you you i guarantee you if i
put a girl if i put a gopro if i put a
video camera on you and i watch you
you're going to be doing a whole bunch
of nonsense and then the first thing
you're going to say right now
i know you're right i will but that even
that's nonsense
if you really knew
if you really knew that it was nonsense
you wouldn't be doing it
but you don't know
that's just lip service you don't know
that's the beginning of self-honesty
not by me saying to you
but by you giving yourself the freedom
to be able to
acknowledge that inside yourself
without the slightest bit of
self-condemnation
that is the beginning of the holy grail
and that exists
nowhere in society
not in the meditation hall
not in the retreat
not not with the mindfulness instructor
not with the motivational speaker not
even with the priest
that exists nowhere
so do you think all of us deal with this
self image that's a lie then
is that identity a lie is that is that
just

it doesn't matter what it is
then your first question was more honest
because
as soon as you ask if it's no good well
that's just back to prescription what i
said yeah that's not good
all right well pretend i didn't say that
you're gonna say oh since i said it was
no good you're gonna dissolve your
self-image in five minutes
i didn't say that pretend i didn't say
it
okay so your first question was
is are we all just lying to ourselves
through self-image the answer to that is
yes now all that remains is
all that remains
was is
that question come from
was that a question for listeners
was that a question that was
intellectual
or did it tear your heart out
but you can't answer it right now you
know
it isn't about condemnation it isn't
about judgment it isn't about me
standing here and saying this because
you're gonna assume that i want you to
say actually you're going to say x
because that's that's what you've been
raised by the culture to do
if you don't do it you're bad
and here's five steps to get out of it
if you go over the five steps now you're
really bad
well guess what
um
there is no badness first of all
second of all
the five steps don't work
so you're screwed all the way around
yeah so it's that
the validation
of right or wrong that we're just stuck
in that damn thinking well just to
believe this to believe
that there is actually a right action
or a right thought
or a right thing to do
that simply doesn't exist
the fundament of truth is so
revolutionary
that it so completely tears
the most foundational elements of all
that a human has taught he no longer
knows which way is up he'll be afraid to
even say his own name
in fear that even that may be a lie
the human has drifted so deep
into
lies
and untruths
that he shouldn't say work
everything is a lie
no one realizes the degree to which
society
has
completely imprisoned and destroyed the
fabric of the human organism
so kapilar are you at a point where you
just totally ignore your mind
that's a beautiful question
um
you know it doesn't matter i'm not going
to go into the are you at a point stuff
because then that gets into
contests right let me just let me just
say this um
[Music]
in fact i was the writer
they sent a scrolling opera
the
the mind
is not
you
and you didn't really hear me
and you're not going to and it doesn't
matter
at least at least
it went through acoustically
so what does that mean the mind is not
me
i mean we hear we hear the egos and
you're not your thoughts and so forth
and i know that's not you
well everything that you think that you
know if you don't
the beliefs and opinions that you have
purchased
are so laughably wrong
that if if a god came out of the sky
and you believe him because he was god
and he showed you that this is the real
truth
you would be dumbfounded of just
a ridiculously long and off topic so far
from the truth you are
all right so let's let me kind of ask
you two quick questions dan but where we
started
um
and this this is kind of a philosophical
question i've been kind of toying around
in my head do you feel that the
that's going on in the world with this
coronavirus
is this the wake-up call
the collective
needed to say that you've been so
up for a long time it's time for you to
shake out of this and maybe a few
people will ultimately do
do you think we've been waiting for this
there's going to be armageddon a
thousand times over
this is not the beginning this has been
going on
in various forms forever right
so
once this thing is passed
then
basically everyone will go back
but if you might
get to that level of seriousness that
you're talking about
yeah they might even with no combiners
there's always some people out there who
are all in cusp you know and a brisk
wind blows and that puts them over the
edge
but the answer to your question is sure
it might it might you know
things that are extreme like i said
things that are extreme
um
usually you know at least have the
potential to have some effect on someone
yes
and and how does this help us come to
grips with pain
that's some self a new age
what is that
[Music]
you know it's like taking the
palestinian flag to the israelis come on
deal with
right what do you would deal with i i
don't understand it or real
everything against dealing with like if
you have cancer you want to deal with it
you want to deal with cancer
no i want to kick attacks
how do you how does someone feel better
if they're in pain don't care i agree
okay so if if if you if you if you hit
him in the alarm arm's gonna hurt
and then you alleviate the arm with some
bomb tomorrow you're gonna hit the leg
that leg's gonna hurt and the next thing
the head's gonna come it's fine go to
the motivational speaker and the
mindfulness
that that's just part of life do we
understand that exactly the suffering
component
you understanding pain
of suffering
that that's just that you know for us
that that's part of life that's part of
you know that's part of our journey the
truth
well
you know tone speaks everything right
now
so
that was a very that was an
apologeticness for
well that was part of life that's just
okay and i'm not going to say
and i'm not i'm not going to say that
you were right or wrong with that i'm
going to say if someone says suffering
is a part of life that's just what it is
okay if someone says suffering is a part
of life and i want to know really how to
get really i i want to understand it
totally different story and i know that
we're going to lack
the latter one because it's proper but
you know it it's
life absolutely is suffering
but it isn't just because the events of
life are suffering
life is suffering
because of the illusions that we fall
into as human beings the illusion of
mind the illusion that we are ourselves
the illusion of attachment
all of these things being completely
being attached
to a notion of a self
that is suffering and if a person did
not have that
then
any he could have all the bad events
happen to them and wouldn't be affected
by them so this isn't the events that
are suffering the events or indeed
something but
but
that is not the fundament of the
suffering
you hey man i i love so much
just
having these conversations and and
hearing your perspective
and whether you like it or not it
impacts five six ten of us
so i always appreciate it so uh so let's
dive in
i'm sure that you are uh probably done
talking about
the state of the world so i want to get
into something i think would be useful
to to people and certainly to me you and
i talk a lot about
dna you know especially when it comes to
athletics and i want to get your
thoughts on whether or not you feel that
an entrepreneur
is just wired to create you know is
there do you sense that that some
entrepreneurs are just wired to be
entrepreneurs
yeah i mean there's a dna for everyone
so
it it depends upon the person it isn't
really
just because someone's labeled an
entrepreneur
it really depends upon the dna of the
individual regardless of his title
so when when you when what i hear a lot
of people talk about is it
extremely amazing time
to
use the state of the world to create and
to innovate and so forth and so on here
a lot of people talk about ideas very
few of these things come to fruition do
you feel like it's because
most of the people out there lack that
sincerity to to to do to follow through
on their ideas
you know i think it's just i think the
question really only pertains to the
ones
who for whatever reason
uh have the compulsion to create
um as opposed to
you know why it is that the others don't
i mean those who don't are not going to
and those who do
um can't help but to so it is what it is
i know that you you personally don't
believe in a process or technique but
i'm going to ask this question anyway i
was spent several hours today talking to
a group of really talented people
uh business people and one of the things
that they were talking the phrase that i
heard probably 50 times during the hour
and a half of conversation was protect
the process protect the process said the
way we get out of this thing is to
protect the process the way that we
innovate is to protect the process
you don't believe in a process
well i don't believe in anything um
because it's not about belief
you know human beings like to hang on to
terms and ideas and concepts
and they turn those into gods and they
begin worshiping at the feet of a
concept
and so like the truth is whatever it is
right it isn't about plucking one idea
out and then worshiping it
worshiping at that altar and so that's
kind of what everyone does i mean
vulnerability and process and this and
that and and they they idolize the term
and it's never the term it's never it's
never the word it's never the concept
because if you if you look at things
through that lens you'll become very um
myopic you won't see the whole picture
so you real if you're if you're beholden
to ideas and concepts
um then
you don't really have the eyes to see
the entire truth
well they use it a lot because of of
athletes right that they sense that well
you know
you have to you have to understand
something
you know
intelligence is seeing the pattern
behind things
and if you if you look at the themes and
you look at the patterns of human beings
what they do is
you know they they try to get people to
do x because they don't like why and
when they when they say x they just
they just basically go to the extreme of
the x
everything is a reaction too so the only
reason that they mentioned process is
because
people started looking at results and
then they got nervous about the result
so then they created books on the
process as a direct knee-jerk reaction
to
uh result
so they just replaced result with
process and it it's it's all just a
shell game it doesn't it isn't for
sincere serious individuals
you know it's so i don't want you
worrying about the result so let's just
i'm going to worry about the process as
if that's the king now
it isn't process or result i mean it's
it's
it's about finding out where you want to
go it's not about it's not about
worshiping words
and that's where everyone is you know
this you know all these like i said you
know
be courageous and be vulnerable and be
prideful you know this is all just
nonsense idiot talk it's not reality
it's it's just turning the english
language
um into a bunch of demi gods to follow
what do you what do you think about when
you hear that because obviously i mean
we have probably heard more about
resilience and courage and vulnerability
over the last month and a half
than you know in a long time but they
are buzzwords in business do you just
not think about that well i i think i
well i think you know
there's no good or bad wrong or right
that just there's just the truth and the
truth is that very very very very very
very very few human beings on this
planet are looking for the truth and
that isn't a bad thing or a good thing
and and when
a person is not
looking for the truth
then
all of these
side effects and circumstances
um however they manifest themselves
such as worshiping words and ideas and
concepts
uh and all these things those are the
natural result of not seeking the truth
and they're like i said it it must be
critically understood that it isn't
about
the fact that you should seek the truth
that's just the way it is
and and and the truth
typically lives outside of your mind
right like you never really see well
well well no i don't i don't know i
think that's i think that's sort of a
mind-generated statement because
and that's kind of mine saying don't
bother because it's so far outside your
mind that you're never going to get to
it so because of that let's just stick
with the status quo and so it really it
you know i can't stress and emphasize
enough i mean i can't scream from the
rooftops enough that it isn't about
seeking the truth
um it's just about who you are and if
that's your dna that's what you're going
to do and if it's not there's no reason
to having a conversation but there's
really not i mean because there's no
point in talking to that kind of that
type of individual at least not for me
um that's not what i'm interested in i
i'm not interested in explaining to
someone why they don't seek the truth
and and in any in any you know clever
shape or form
suggesting that they should
but but you inspire
some of us
to to to at least to start to think like
that well well well okay fine but let's
just be honest moe right let's just be
frankly honest if we may um if i did
inspire that then i wouldn't get these
kind of questions right if i really
inspired you let's say that i inspired
you i don't mean to and i'm not saying
that i'm worthy of inspiring anyone but
let's just say by some accident that i
did
then
i don't think that these would be the
type of questions that would
naturally blossom inside of you
right most most importantly most
importantly and like i said i'm just
we're just having it really
you know there's no reason having a
podcast about crap like
all the rest of them all right let's
we're going to talk honestly now right
so okay so
so so there really is and it isn't about
me condemning you or anything i'm just
speaking openly here um it's it's
if
if you really wanted the truth and if
that really was what you were inspired
to do
then i think it would be all about you
i think that your questions would would
arise
in a way that would help you get to the
truth and the idea of helping quote
society or the listeners or the audience
or the world while while they may be on
the other line listening so to speak um
that wouldn't be where your allegiance
is
because the allegiance is never to the
other the allegiance is never to the
world those are all just
those are just made up manufactured
ideas um in the form of ego it really is
if if it's about the person himself
if that person is truly genuinely
inspired just because they are then the
the quality of the question that they
ask will reflect that
well i have to tell you that
i feel like i have
grown infinitely from the standpoint of
this whole notion of helping people and
you know and you kind of have haven't
you kind of imprinted in my mind to just
be very conscious of that so as i think
about it it's hard for me to let go
of
what is it that we can have
conversations around certainly that
could help me but help others
at the same time
i
understand that
at some point i personally have to say
you know what here are some things that
i need to stop doing in order to get
well i i i don't know i i kind of
perhaps would say that it isn't about
you stopping anything
i think that the stopping happens by
itself
and i think all things are a an offshoot
of realization and understanding
and so it isn't that you have to stop
anything because that would be false and
that would just be a reaction to
something else
so it it really is the understanding
that if for whatever reason someone is
really desirous of helping someone else
and let's say that that let's say that
for whatever reason that desire to
really genuinely
uh and organically help other people was
was really deep and sincere in a human
being
then
the only way to really help anyone else
is to understand yourself i get it
because because everyone is in the same
boat every human being rich
poor
any country that they live in any
village
all human beings suffer from the same
plight all human beings
um
go through the same types of assaults
from the mind in the form of anxiety and
fear and concern and anger and
uh emotional upheaval and uncertainty
and all of these things and
and so no one's really unique in that
everyone
every everyone
everyone has to go through those storms
and so that being the case
then it really is about um
having the genuineness to go through
that storm for yourself
and if someone is going to learn and
become inspired or whatever it may be
then that will be that will come from
not you trying to help them
but
you essentially uh
you know finding that within yourself
when do you get a gauge of that level of
sincerity or seriousness within yourself
what do you mean
there's a part of you that feels like
i i have an incredible amount of
seriousness or sincerity and i'm trying
to kind of think within the context of
how you think
to truly
for my own well-being
try to understand my own truth
a lot of times i'm conflicted between is
that narrative going on in my head or is
that sincerity in the way that you look
at it
yes so
um
perhaps the safest response is to say
that it's always a narrative and it's in
it and if it's sincerity it's
insincerity
in the willingness to understand that
it's all a narrative
as opposed to trying to dissect out the
pieces that are true versus false i
think understanding that they're it's
all false
and the only sincerity is the thing that
um compels you to do what you do because
whatever you
whatever action that you take
that is your natural desire
that will what you do is a reflection of
what you really feel inside and so
that is a much better gauge
than um sort of intellectual
conversations with yourself about
whether something is sincere or not
and is that
two things i want to bring up here what
one of the things
that you wrote not too long ago that
really got me thinking about that was
when you talked about the difference
between somebody who's a superstar what
they do and one who struggles
um you know and it's the person who is a
superstar enjoys being a superstar the
other person enjoys the struggle and i
think you made a comment that if there's
only one person in you know the twitter
universe that understands that
um
is that what we're talking about here
well i i was saying that there might be
only one person in the twitter universe
who understands the messages that come
onto my twitter account
and wasn't i wasn't talking specifically
about that statement um you know the
messages that
you know that appear on the twitter
account really are
you know a lot of them are cryptic and a
lot of them are um they are you know
they can be difficult to understand but
uh but but that's
but you know everything has to be stated
in its raw form and whoever's
sort of ready to hear it is and who's
not is not
and so it isn't about dumbing things
down for the public and the masses um i
i have no interest in that
uh uh that's you know society is
saturated with you know catering to the
masses and so for me
it it really it isn't you know those
messages aren't put to change anyone or
to
you know make someone you know follow my
way of doing things or to teach anyone
they just they just are and
um
and then because they're not dumbed down
then it really requires a reach
on the part of the individual
to want to understand them and not that
they should but if for whatever crazy
reason they're compelled to then so be
it um so it isn't it isn't about
bending down and giving to the poor so
to speak
um
it is it is you know the the poor man is
most helped when he's inspired he is
most helped um when he
is compelled to
get up onto his own two feet because
that will last him for the rest of his
life
uh handouts don't
so and once again i must be clear i'm
not doing this because i think this is
better for humanity i'm not doing this
because i think this is good for you for
you to be able to reach as opposed to me
just to give it to you i'm not doing it
for you um it just sort of comes and it
appears on the page
but and that's what i appreciate so much
about it but this statement really did
get me thinking the difference between a
superstar athlete the one who struggles
throughout his career is the one who
enjoys being a superstar and the other
enjoys the struggle so is that telling
me that the overwhelming majority of the
world just loves to live in misery well
there is great comfort
in misery and there's nothing wrong with
living in misery
um
and
there's no judgment comfort in misery
well
familiarity
you know where whatever someone is most
accustomed to
that's the home that a human being has
built
and so in that home
he or she knows where the furniture is
he or she knows that even if the lights
are turned off he or she knows which
hall to walk down and then where exactly
the bedroom is and where the library is
and where the bathroom is without even
having to see
now if you place that person into a
brand new house in a new city you know
that's there's great discomfort there
and and by the way i must stop once
again and i have all these disclaimers
because i know where people's minds go
because they're conditioned by society
it isn't
it isn't good to feel discomfort it
isn't good for you that that you should
feel discomfort and that you should get
out yeah that's all crap yeah there's no
you know once again see i can't say two
words without without a bumper sticker
showing up and floating across the tv
screen you know what i mean so um it
it's there's no should there's no you
should be
uncomfortable no you shouldn't you
shouldn't do anything it isn't about
doing this or that um so but that's
that's the reason why it's you become
comfortable according to what you're
accustomed to and that's kind of the
you know it's kind of that
the idea from
the shawshank redemption right where the
individual was in prison for 50 years
and then
didn't want to get let out because
there was this big new world that the
person had no idea how to
you know how to live in
and that's you know that was so called
institutionalized and uh it's it's very
that's that's that's very emblematic of
of
of human beings it's funny that you say
that i'd literally just rewatch that
movie over the weekend so do you think
that
maybe the the perhaps the biggest reason
that gets in the way of us
choosing
to change
is that that level of familiarity is
acceptable to us
it is but there's a tinge in your voice
which is that you shouldn't be
you know it's almost like everything
that you say is a is a lesson you know
and and like so what if right so
so so i said so i say yes that's correct
i mean your implication is written on
the wall which says thou shall not
be comfortable and now shall you know
what i mean it's it's so implicit in
what you're saying and that's just the
the cultural conditioning of society it
isn't about helping the audience whoever
wants to get helped believe me they'll
they will reach the way they have to
reach they will do what they have to do
um but the more that you have to bend
down
uh and make up for the lack of sincerity
by you know the bending of your posture
it's a waste of time and quite frankly
not it only is a waste of time even if
it worked it it's it's of no joy to me
to do that it's boring you know
there's i have no interest in that so so
let me ask you then between the the
whole i know your your perspective on
self-improvement right versus arrival
so what i'm interested in now is i hear
you say that is what do you call
everything in between where you are
right now and that arrival destination
where you know you're getting closer to
the truth is that not progress is that
not like what do you call that
yeah so these are very very difficult
conversations
because the language that we're speaking
um
you know maybe english but
it's it's a whole different plane of of
of conversation
you know
it's kind of like when they say that you
know
god does not get sad or
you know basically the only
the idea of sadness is in the is in the
human framework
why would you even apply sadness to god
and the only reason that you would is
because the only way that a human being
can view things is through his own
framework right so god god if he exists
he might say well what is sadness i've
never heard of that before right what do
you mean by that and so
so when you say what do you call that i
mean there's no
the name that i give you you're going to
apply it in the world of the culture and
it's not going to happen
how do you think of that the in between
so it isn't it isn't there is no in
between
there's only there's only the sincerity
of the past that you were on
so when someone is genuinely on the path
of truth
he's on the path of truth from the very
first step when the person's on a path
to prescription he's on prescription
from the very first step and those paths
do not meet so it's the nature of the
path it isn't the progress bar
and the reason that you have progress
bars
is because no one gets anywhere and the
reason that no one gets anywhere is
because prescriptions don't get you
anywhere and that doesn't mean that you
should not follow prescriptions they
just they just they just don't and i i i
implore that no one take that to heart
and say well i'm not gonna follow
prescriptions anymore that will be a
waste of time it's about it's about if
you have the sincerity or the desire or
the longing or the interest or the
attraction to the idea of looking into
prescriptions and how um they sabotage
human beings and they simply are have
absolutely no possibility of getting
anyone anywhere that is consistent or
permanent then you will if you don't
then you don't but it isn't about me to
say that you shouldn't follow
prescriptions because that itself would
be a prescription for of course i mean i
i get that part for you personally do
you do you look at it as a path
towards your own truth or
do you look at it do you get up every
day and
you just know intellectually or you know
however you want to think about it that
that's your singular mission in life and
whatever comes through you that day is
leading you towards that so imagine
imagine a person who's smitten by the
stock market right
so
right so imagine this a person who just
lives eats and breathes the stock market
now the moment that he gets up you know
he starts checking you know his
portfolio starts looking at this talks
starts looking at the market starts
looking at the dow he's looking at all
these things
and then on the tv he has the ticker
going across the screen right and and
he's got the wall street journal and
he's got all the stuff so everything in
his life
you could never so for a person who's
obsessed with the stock market and by
the way please not no good or bad here
i'm just making an example a person
who's obsessed healthy yeah
well what do you mean this will be being
obsessed with the stock market is is you
know very detrimental to your health
nothing is detrimental to anything if
you're if you're if you're obsessed with
uh
you know
self-improvement that isn't healthy
either they're all dead ends so it
doesn't really matter so but if you so
imagine this guy if you if you take a
cross-section of any point of his day
there is never a time
that he is either looking or thinking
about the stock market and so
that is his path
that wasn't that wasn't even consciously
chosen it chose him sure so it's the
same thing with the truth so
it isn't
it isn't you know a person who was
obsessed with the truth he never he
never leaves that so even if he goes to
buy a gallon of milk he's thinking about
truth and and that's why that's why it
is it is really counterproductive and
really of of no useful
uh
of no value
for someone to say well you know uh well
how often do you think about truth and
do you
um
you know
how many times a day do you think about
it
the person who's obsessed with truth he
never leaves it he never leaves it and
that's why all these part-time
spirituality things you know i'm gonna
go meditate for an hour or 20 minutes
and then i'm going to go see this over
here you know those things
once again they're not wrong they're not
wrong you're not killing anybody they're
not wrong right well even killing it
someone's not wrong but that's another
podcast
but but but
they're not you know wrong it's just
it's just that's
that's prescriptive and even being
prescriptive is not wrong it's just that
that won't get you anywhere and even
that's not wrong it's just if someone
really wants to get there for that
rare person who really wants to get
there and to arrive and has gotten
sidetracked by
the misinformation
that prescription is the way to get
there then that person may benefit from
knowing and and experimenting with the
idea that prescription will not get him
there because because quite frankly for
the most people they don't really care
that prescription won't get them there
because they're only looking to get
anywhere right they enjoy as you said
the process they enjoy the practicing
right they enjoy this is part of my day
and i go exercise over here and i go see
the meditation
instructor over here and i get my yoga
mat over here and there's nothing wrong
i'm not belittling them that's just what
they do
so they're not interested in an arrival
so for them it really is of no
consequence to know that prescription is
not the way because that isn't they
actually seek prescription that's what
they actually want so this is for the
one who really wants to arrive
but
has gotten sidetracked
and do you get a sense of that arrival
when the things that used to arise in
your mind don't arise anymore do you
know that yes is that kind of how this
what you start to feel yes
yeah something within you begin to
transform and it happens all by itself
and it's all about it's all about
exposure if you are only exposed to
one thing one thing meaning
one way which is the prescription way
that's all you will know that's you you
what else would there be and that's why
it is such an antithetical concept for
most it's a it's a tectonic shift
concept that is it's
it's almost
insane what do you mean there is no how
because when someone it's all that
they've known for 40 50 60 80 years is
the how and there's been no
no
contrary view
right no opposing view to that that
there is or even an alternative then
naturally that's the only thing they're
going to know kapil does the writing
that you do every day
help you with your mind you know the
writing the writing just comes from this
ethereal place that i can't explain
and it it really is
it really is about the the image
it thinks it's poetic
well you know the poetic you know if it
i know if it happens to be poetic but
some deem it poetic
um that perhaps is a is an intersection
of
um
the
sort of the the speaking in tongues
um you know unself-conscious
free-flowing stream of of uh
of
internal feeling
that's sort of being channeled from
somewhere else
intersected with some small facility of
talent for the act of writing and so
that may be you know where some words
might come from or or you know a
sentence that you know one person may
perhaps think is nicely phrased you know
i think it's the intersection of those
two things and are you writing for
yourself
or
are you you know you
yeah it's a good question um
you know it really it really
for me is about
um
the immersion and
if i if i write to teach if i write to
instruct if i write to even the right to
help
for right for another uh it really isn't
it really it really isn't a an out of
body experience it becomes more like
work and i have no interest in working
um so so it isn't you know i could say i
suppose you could say in some ways it's
for myself but it it's even beyond that
i would say it's it's from beyond myself
somewhere um it just it just comes so it
isn't it isn't you know we'll read this
and then go implement this you know
and
um
you know that's i know that's what the
world is used to but that's not just not
what this is
it just comes from somewhere so it
really isn't a
for something or someone you know what i
mean so it's definitely not for an
audience and
you certainly i assume you're at a point
where
approval
disapproval you're completely agnostic
to that yeah and and and i and i hate to
even say that because
because i don't want to take it
yeah i mean the thing is though it's
true but i i don't
i don't want to take ownership of that
to say to imply like like look where
i've arrived like i don't care what
anyone thinks you know um
i mean it's i will say very very softly
and almost apologetically that
yeah i mean i don't really care if
someone likes it or not or if they agree
with it or not in fact i don't like
agreement
um i don't i don't it doesn't interest
me i mean to get and all these things
sound
so out of the mainstream right you know
yeah i get a lot of emails saying you
know thank you
i guess you know changed my life it
wasn't me it was the words and if they
if there was some it was some communion
between you and the words right it was
that communion which which helped you in
some way
um
but so i don't want to say yeah i don't
care whether you like it or not um as if
i'm taking ownership of some
characteristic that i've successfully
achieved it's it just happens to be that
way that i
i'm not really interested in if someone
likes it or not yes but i but i say it
very softly not so that i won't be
offensive i say it softly because i
don't want to have any ownership of any
any characteristic that i can sort of
plant a flag and say this is what i've
achieved i've
i not to be humble i just have no
interest in that i know that and and i
appreciate that and certainly like the
comments that you get when people say
that you changed your impact however you
want to take a look at it of people's
lives it certainly happens and i'm i'm
always saying that to you but isn't that
also where kind of freedom lies is when
you have that sense of independence from
what people think and then obviously
there's absolutely enormous that's one
that's one of the the greatest
milestones of freedom that there is is
to be completely independent of the
opinion of others and even
more critically the next level is to be
completely independent of the opinions
of yourself
do you analyze at all the relationship
that you have with yourself i know it's
an incredible immersion and obsession
with doing what you're doing but do you
do you feel like you have a peaceful
relationship with yourself you know i'm
sort of so deep into the fibers of it
that i
that i don't really take a step back to
say
what you know where
where it is
so that i can put a plaque on it you
know what i mean so
like there there's there's such a
natural obsession that's not good or bad
there just is there's such a natural
obsession for the arrival of truth and
all things
that i never like stop and then
take you know step back
10 feet and say what is the relationship
what we call this piece what will we
call this
uh you know not not really interested i
mean it it
you know
nothing is ever that clean
right i mean even if you look at even if
you look at a river i mean the the
purest river you'll have some places
where it's murky and then you'll have
some places where it's crystal clear
and and the murky part isn't trying to
become clear there just happens to be
maybe some seaweed in that area or a
collection of rocks or a little bit of
sediment which makes it look murky so it
it
nothing is ever linear and nothing is
ever clean it's
um
everything everything is an immersive
that which is genuine is an immersive
process
um and there really is no judgment as to
whether it's
this or that
you to me are in constant examination
mode and as i was sharing with you on on
this zoom call this morning with with a
couple of these leaders i could just
sense in the tone of their language and
in the verbiage and
just what i see on camera is that
they're not actually struggling with
their companies they're struggling with
themselves
and that's what triggered me asking you
that question it was it's very visible
when you when you see somebody who has a
really appears to have a really
challenging relationship with themselves
well there are no business problems
there are no sports problems they're
only human problems all conflict is
self-conflict that's right right yeah
that's something that's probably been
edged in my mind for a while a friend
wanted to ask me
wanted me to ask you a question about
friendship
how do you look at friendship
and how valuable is it to you that's a
good question um
you know like i'm i'm not any standard
right to which to by which to judge
um
so it's not about following
anything that i you know how i view
things um
it you know everyone has their own life
and
well you know what i will say what i
will say is this
and and before even saying it it's once
again it's critical not to take it to
heart because
if you follow it and prescriptionize it
it's useless to you
um
if it connects with you on a
non-intellectual level then so be it
anything that you attach to in this life
you'll pay a price and whether it's a
thing or whether it's a person and
and you just can't have a conversation
with someone who
responds to that by saying then what
should i do should i not have any
friends should i not
the answer to that is just silence you
can't respond to that because
that isn't a sincere question you know
it isn't about
if if that statement struck something in
you then it did if it didn't
then obviously it didn't if it led to
that kind of question
so so the truth is
that any form of attachment dependency
or reliance
in any way upon any human being
i don't care if it's your children or
your wife it doesn't matter i don't care
about your parents
i mean parents will go out of their way
parents will give their lives for their
children okay
but if
but if you
but you have to understand that a human
is a human first
and that isn't to be compassionate
that's just a fact a human is a human
before he is a father a mother a brother
a sister a son whatever he may be he's a
human first
and if we if we
if you view humans as humans and you
understand that fundamentally a human
will always be a human first
before he will be any role
that he or she plays
then you will understand
that to attach yourselves to that human
is to attach yourself based upon the
role that you have created
and to attach yourself based upon the
role that you have created
you are going to
um
invite
loads of misery
because
that is a square peg in a round hole
you are viewing the human through the
role
you know
child
parent sister or whatever it is
but
that isn't the allegiance of the human
the allegiance of a human is to his
humanness to his freedom
much more than it is to his role and i'm
not saying that they won't be allegiance
to the role but that won't comfort that
primally on a primal basis that will not
come first and that and that isn't good
or bad that isn't right or wrong that
makes so much sense to me
if if you're sitting around with your
boys having a conversation about
friendships or relationships
do you ever inject your own perspective
or do you yeah that's a dangerous
question i you know
um
yeah so
it's
what are you gonna get if you talk to me
right i mean i'm gonna tell you what it
is and
you're probably not going to be ready
to hear it and that isn't a hierarchical
thing it's just
it's
it's just it's gonna be crazy talk right
so yeah i've told i've told them both
that
you know you don't really have any
friends
there's you know
at the end of the day
the person that you can rely upon most
is yourself you know and we'll be here
to help you but at the end of the day
uh especially as an adolescent
friendship is a disaster
because
um
in because this the the environment the
culture
and the generation
in which we live in now
is the single most degraded generation
ever to walk the face of the earth for
sure
and so
if everyone in perfect segway right if
everyone's infected
right by
mass media and the
language being used and the pop culture
and the
music which curses every other word
and the movies that are you know put out
from hollywood that
are so bad that they're not even worth
airtime and even the podcasts that are
put out they're all just
prescriptionized
self-help jargon just garbage i'm sorry
it just is man
and the books that are published on the
bestseller list so when you live in a
world in which 360 everything around you
is of
of
harmful
low quality
then
anything or person that you pluck out of
that place
is likely to be saturated with these
infections
so
unless you happen to pluck that one in a
million
individual who renounces all of these
things you're not going to pluck gandhi
out of the you're just not all right
so
so
naturally you have to look at the source
if you go to a polluted pond
you're going to get polluted fish
so it isn't so much about people
it's about the environment it's about
the culture
if you happen to
so-called befriend a person who lives
in a remote village in africa or in
india or somewhere you know it you can't
say for sure but there's because that
source is more
pure
and more
and less
um
touched by the hand of
modernity
then i would say there perhaps is a
certainly a more
a higher likelihood that that individual
is someone who will be a good influence
upon you
but
societal
urbanites
of the modern culture
you
you're
is a 100 million chance
that you're going to befriend or
surround yourself with those who are
going to bring you to higher heights in
fact they're going to bring you to lower
lows and since you become
your environment
regardless of your intentions or your
efforts
then
it naturally
is
logical
that so-called friendship and relations
are a non-starter and they're very
harmful does it surprise you that that
people despite the fact
that uh you are your purpose is not to
help others gravitate to every word you
say
i'm not sure how much how many gravitate
you know i'm not sure um
it
i would certainly say that those people
who are fed up with the status quo
and
the the traditional norms uh and
cultural society uh certainly might find
a home in
in uh you know in this
in this
sort of approach
um and in these words um
but i would say that for the most it's
it's too far outside the mainstream
to
to really um
perhaps catch their interest in any
significant way i mean and and once
again what i just said has no
significance whatsoever because i have
no idea how people
feel should be sure i'll you know you
know i get the emails and i get but
that's once again i mean this
there's uh
there's there's
well i mean you know i mean you've asked
me before you've asked me doesn't that
make you feel good and isn't that
awesome and
i don't know i mean i it's i i would say
it's good for them
you know it isn't
it isn't
good or bad for me
it's good for them it's it's
it's helpful for them if if they happen
to connect with something and it
sparks something in them and it
changed you know their
way of living or existence whatever it
may be
that's that's great for them but like i
don't i don't go on the lookout for
those kind of emails and
and responses on twitter and you know
like
that's you know and take like all this
pride from it um
and once again i'm not saying that
that's like i'm so evolved that i don't
i just wanna i
might i can only raise my hands i can
only raise my hands and say listen
i can't i just the interest isn't really
there like it doesn't
you know what i mean that's not why i
did it so
i don't take pride from that they
happened to get something from the words
it was a communion between the words and
them and so be it i mean
what else can i say i don't want to take
ownership of anything as if i'm going to
stand tall and say yes that does not
affect me and i don't want to own that i
don't i don't i'm just describing the
way that i feel
well let me let me ask you two more
other quick things um again a couple of
kind of emerged today and this is again
i really want your honest opinion on
that um a lot of people were talking
about you know this is a really great
time to get in you know to find your
flow this is a really great time to
train your mind to get in the zone and
so forth well but but
hang on but but stop stop right there
this is a really great time to do all
the
as opposed to what as opposed to what
time as opposed to being comfortable
with normality which is get up and go to
work and you know well it doesn't matter
[Music]
you know if this thing happens to spark
something in you which lasts a lifetime
fine
but
it's very likely that
even even if your mind drifted towards
this is a very good time to do x once
the time changes you'll revert back sure
so it's back to like
you know
new year resolution type things
you know what what does that flow or in
the zone mean to you personally is that
is that
it's a state of no mind and and is that
something
that you find yourself there throughout
the day
or do you can you call that on demand if
you find your mind cluttered
yes i can but
i i i ask for a thousand apologies for
saying that because
i just do i it's very apologetic for me
to say that i'm just answering your
question uh directly
um
because
because that i thought that isn't an
accomplishment that i'm proud of
it's it's just you know it's just i kind
of just found my my way there because
um
i had to find the way there you know it
was it was it was that
obsessive to me it was so that deep
of a desire to me and therefore i did
and that applies to any human being
whatever someone's really obsessed by
they'll get there
and they'll find it because they there's
no choice for them and so
and so you know so i i say it
apologetically because it's not some
some kind of you know feather in the cap
that i want to walk around with and i
just don't but i i just answer your
question directly well i appreciate it
so let me end with this
in terms of the the deep examination
that you're constantly doing on yourself
are you primarily studying all the
mistakes that you've made and trying to
understand
why they happened and what's causing
them
oh no i already know where all the
mistakes happened so what what what are
you doing then during that if you know
mistake x happened are you just digging
deeper into the layer of why they
happened no it's just about a genuine
desire to understand the whole picture
it's about a genuine and obsessive
desire and a longing to arrive at the
truth about all things
so mistakes are the natural result
of lack of understanding
and a lack of understanding is to a
large and significant degree
the natural result of wanting to seek
prescriptions instead of understanding
so wherever um a person airs
um that is
you know a person functions according to
his level of understanding and it's all
on inside game
meaning what it's all in your head but
that has many connotations
you know words are dangerous where what
you well you know what you just said
is going to be taken the cultural way
and therefore it's uh
you know it's it's
yes it is all internal it is
it is not in other words it's not that
you did this and you should have done
that right that isn't the mistake the
mistake
is the mistake is to believe that there
is a that
that and once again where are you going
to go with that right i mean this is so
ridiculously off the wall that you know
we're on the other side of the himalayas
over here and we're talking to
you know
you know
we're talking on this side of the
himalayas at the foothills right so
so what are you going to do with that
right to say that there is no this or
that
if you're going to if you're going to
put a gun to someone's head and say you
must say what wrong is okay well wrong
is this is wrong and that is wrong
you know the idea that you believe that
there's a there's a right way
is is wrong it's not truth
so
the understanding
and the arrival of that understanding
that it isn't about doing this or that
that is the understanding that one does
not have when they make
error upon error
it isn't because lack of intelligence
and or anything else it isn't because
behavior or modification and
psychotherapy and
don't get me angry because i don't go
down that road you know all the
self-help stuff you know it just isn't
there it is about a fundamental lack of
understanding as a result of
a fundamental lack of the desire to
understand i just i have to ask you this
do you see
generationally that the world evolves
out of this situation that we're dealing
with better off worse off the same
well if it's better off it's going to
revert
so it doesn't really matter it at it at
the end of the day
it is the
you know this virus situation is just
one more manifestation
of just how far humans have drifted from
their own nature
so this is just the detail
so
what's different about war
right i mean
there's wars all around the world yeah
so
if you look at every part of of of human
action
all around the world
you will see that
the degradation of human beings is
manifest in every possible way this is
just another detail this is just another
exhibit a
and there's going to be more of this so
this is just happens to me you know the
category
of
you know
biological infection
you know there's 100 categories and
they're all degraded it's just that we
haven't so
no one is you know everyone's sort of
desensitized to war
because it's been going on for so long
well this the virus thing is is sort of
new at to this scale especially and
therefore it's at the forefront because
this category hasn't really
been at least you know in modern times
um seen to this degree
and so these are all just categories
human
the human civilization
has
has sunk so low
because it isn't because they did the
wrong things
and they need all this kumbaya crap
it's it's it's because it's because
they have moved away from their
fundamental nature
and whenever you move away from nature
catastrophe
is
the natural consequence
well that's pretty anybody who questions
that uh it's about as clear as it comes
listen man i it's always a highlight for
me i always appreciate your perspective
whether you like it or not
and you know so tell me something new
that you've recently learned
that you didn't know before
i think it relates to
the nature of who we believe ourselves
to be
beyond simply the
idea of
disenfranchising
the ego
but more fundamentally
the concept of
frankly the concept of self-concept
and the concept of self-image
it seems to govern our entire lives
and i think that the fundamental
realization
of who one really is and more
importantly who won
and what one is not
i think is truly
at the foundation
of
living a
true life
as opposed to
struggling through life
so is it any surprise that that's
the dialogue that you share in the
opening chapter of your new book
which
you know this question compel of who am
i
kind of seems to govern this whole shift
of mindfulness this whole shift of
spiritual thinking and certainly i know
that um
that's part of the the deep thinking
that you do about yourself but i know
that you look at it from a different
context
how do we begin to answer that question
it relates to the things that one can no
longer accept as
all right
there has to be a level of desperation
or unbearability so to speak
with regard to where one is
that really is the only impetus uh to to
change direction in whatever facet of
what whatever facet of life one explores
once something is no longer okay then
a path
away from that is is sought
so it really comes down to
where someone is with regard to
one's level of desperation of no longer
wanting to experience the things
that he or she experiences or the
opposite which is
no longer being able to be kept from
the things that he or she wants to
uh have or attain
so is there really an answer to it like
in your own journey
have you answered that question for
yourself or is it that constant quest
you know i i don't really believe in
constant quests because
that very quickly turns into
a procrastination
and that's exactly
the fundament of human beings is to
procrastinate about everything
and so when someone says that i'm going
to be a perpetual student and always
continue to learn
and it's a constant quest and it's a
journey that has no end
that there is way too much license there
to never arrive anywhere which is
precisely
what the mind happens to want
um because at the end of the day a human
being is a prisoner to his mind
and the ultimate freedom is freedom from
the mind and the freedom from the self
so
so it can't be a constant quest there
has to be an end point and the end point
is the very inspiration the very
motivation
that gets one moving in the first place
what's yours
total freedom
and and so from
when did you know you got there
because
and it's one i haven't gotten there i
haven't gotten there um
this is this is still a quest but it's
by no means is a
is an infinite quest um there there very
definitely better be an endpoint because
uh it simply isn't okay um
with me
uh to
to live in any
imprisoned sort of way to
the the nuances and behaviors and
machinations of the mind that simply
isn't okay so so no i haven't gotten
there it's something that i'm it's
something that is at the center
of my life it's it's my devotion
well and i know that
one of the approaches for all of us to
take
is to start subtracting everything that
isn't supposed to be there
um
from yes yes and no yes or no
um
what you have just said is a true
statement
the truth comes about
largely through subtraction not through
addition that is a true statement
however
the stating it in such a way you spoke
it too easily mo
you said it too easily and and when you
said when you when you say it too easily
it immediately will be imbibed as a
prescription
um so then the whipper will be told to
watch your thoughts
and keep subtracting and keep saying i'm
not that i'm not that
and nettie nettie you know and
there the whole gang of gurus and the
spiritualists come calling you know
if
you can't you can't say it that easily
because you have to be
fully cognizant of the fact that the
people who are listening to you
are not the people themselves but it is
their minds who are listening to you
and when the mind listens to that that
all you have to do is subtract keep
subtracting
um it will then tell its possessor
that
uh or possess e
that
you see this is what you must do
so go over in the corner and begin to
subtract
and that will be its own prison this is
why no one ever gets anywhere
so i understand
the spirit of what you said
but
there must be extreme care
in the way that we speak
because we know that the mind is lurking
behind every corner
so i'm going to come back to that in a
second but let me dive into this first
question because you brought it up
almost invariably when i recommend your
work and when i say your work your books
your discourses your podcasts all the
things that really kind of capture some
of the essence of your thinking the
first question that i get
is
i i
i think i get what he's talking about
but what does he really mean when he
talks about no prescriptions
what do you really mean
okay that's a good question
um first it has to be recognized that
if you follow the
idea of no prescriptions
and
you say to yourself
that i cannot follow a prescription
that i can't follow because it's a
prescription that i can't follow because
it's a prescription
then that in itself becomes a
prescription
so it isn't about adopting the idea of
no prescriptions
then that becomes no
better than anything else
it really it comes down to understanding
so it isn't it isn't me on some pulpit
and you sitting below me and me teaching
and preaching to you we are sitting on
the same side of the desk
and we are conversing together
so
the reason that prescriptions
get people into trouble
is because
a prescription serves only its own end
nobody can be prescribed his way to
success
nobody can be prescribed all the way to
enlightenment
if they could if once again please don't
believe me look at the evidence
if one could
then
the buddha's writings have been around
for hundreds and hundreds of years
uh who has gotten enlightened by reading
any of the four noble truths
and there are zen temples and buddhist
temples all around the world
um how many do you see or have heard of
getting enlightened by visiting a zen
temple or a buddhist monastery or
sitting and doing meditation for six
hours a day so if that were true then
you could very easily be prescribed to
enlightenment because the prescriptions
all exist
in space
same thing with same thing with success
if someone becomes a super successful
ceo or investor or an artist or a singer
or a professional athlete or whatever
if if that could be bottled
then they would just say well just do
this and do this and do this
and you'll become as great as i am well
that's when they tried to it's been
that's right they've been trying again
and again and again well how many
michael jordans do you see walking
around how many tigers do you see
walking around
right so if that were true
then that would be very easy to
replicate but it isn't true that's why
it isn't there
so
we have to look at the evidence and then
and there's the evidence for the fact
that
when you are told that this is what you
must do
and what will happen is that your mind
will focus on the this
it will focus upon
the
the position of your left arm and how
good your lotus position is right and
how straight your back is and how many
times you said the mantra right and how
much incest that did you actually burn
and how many hours did you sit for
and
that becomes a new goal
the prescription itself replaces the
original goal
and now you become subservient
to
doing the prescription
and making that perfect
as opposed to
reaching
somewhere so
whenever you give someone a how to get
there they will forever get to the how
but they will never get to there
and our entire society is based upon
this is the five step plan these are the
three next steps these are the ten ways
to become happy all these things
they normally don't not only do they not
work they can't work
because no one can be prescribed his way
to anything
so how do how do
we start to get there if you had me and
10 others who said hey
i don't need to
tell you how much i appreciate what you
do and your level of thinking but if you
get a group of us in a room to say hey
we want to learn from you we want to get
in this pursuit where we can be the
absolute best versions of ourselves what
are we going to be working on
you're not going to work on anything
um it
first and foremost
is is this take this example
if i drop you into like and you can't
swim
you are not going to ask me how to flail
your arms
somehow in some way
until your arms tire out and you don't
have a single drop of energy left in
your body
you will do anything and everything
necessary to get yourself to shore
you're damn right and the re and the
reason that you will is not because you
took flailing classes
before you went to the lake
the reason that you will
is because
the the key ingredient
of the desperation to get to the shore
was there
the destination the desire the
desperation
creates the how
it is not the other way around
so if that's the case
i mean
there has to be
i have to believe that the great
majority of the world
maybe
they're not in that desperation mode but
if i go out and ask 10 very successful
people and however they define success
is this all there is for you i would bet
you that all 10 would say no there is a
next stage
is that the desperation that we're
looking for or how do you define that
everyone is desperate for something
exactly but very few people ever reach
that level that you're talking about if
any
i think
i don't
i think the ones who are sufficiently
desperate always reach
either by
a serendipitous encounter with someone
either by
happening to be in the right place at
the right time
either by
some idea that comes into them from a
place
unknown
whatever
whenever someone has
a sufficient sufficient level of desire
or desperation
they don't not reach it
you see i don't believe in failure
i i fully expect people to fall
along the way
because everything is experimentation
until you succeed but ultimate failure
ultimate failure
is only for those who are not desperate
enough i just don't buy the idea that i
give an individual
was desperate enough and didn't get
there
i think that the universe is created in
such a way
that when there is a requisite level of
deposit of desperation
that
things begin to happen
that cannot be explained
that aid him in that process
so i want you to give our listeners i'm
assuming here the people who are
listening to this know about what we do
and certainly know about your work
because
you know strategically
the message that you've been sharing
with people is something that i've been
promoting since we met two years ago
give me an example of a before and after
of somebody that you worked with
who
started to get a glimpse of that
i i don't know where
where that really goes mo i mean
um i just want people yeah
i could give you i could give you i
can't i could give you several examples
but but but it but it
you know
i can't provide an explanation as to how
those things happen
so it really becomes a fragment
fragmentary conversation because
um
you know people have you know found
you know
an enormous sense of peace and
uh they begin their behavior begins to
drastically change and
they
you know but
these things
i hesitate greatly in mentioning
these things because
i don't want to sound like a brochure
you know what i mean
because
i never tell anybody when i begin
working with them
this is this is what's this is what's
going to happen this is what i'm going
to promise you
i i'm i'm just as surprised as anybody
else how these things happen that they
happen at all all i know for one thing
which is the absolute
fact
is that
when there is an uncompromising
pursuit
and exploration
of the truth about a given issue
in a given person's life
there are fundamental
physiologic
universal biologic psychological
changes that begin
to happen
the
it's
it's
it's mystical almost i have no idea how
it happens
um
but something within the human organism
responds
to uncompromising and direct truth
so perhaps because it is so foreign
in our world
to talk about anything that is direct
truth everything is superficial and
cosmetic and prescriptive
that
it is it is so
foreign
to delve into that
sort of rarified
um
arena
that maybe that's why things begin to
happen
but they just do and i can't predict
what's going to happen
but
that's what i've seen time and time
again so do you find that there's
something missing
in you know in that quest
because the next big question i get is
what exactly is this truth that he's
talking about
so
take you know
it's it's crucial to begin with those
things that are most acute in someone's
life
so
wherever
wherever one wants to go um he or she
can only go there from where they
currently are
so the most practical things that are
happening in one's life be it a you know
conflict with others or be anxiety or
depression or um
whatever it is
um that's where we must begin
and so
the
the exploration
is not about how do we lessen your
anxiety
the exploration station is not about
these are the things that you can do to
make yourself feel better i have no
interest in making anybody feel better
i couldn't care less if you felt better
that is not what i'm here to do
because i know for a fact that whenever
you feel better
sooner or later you're going to feel
worse again that's all part of the same
game
that isn't a game i'm interested in
playing so the real the exploration of
the truth comes in
when you begin to dive deep into the
very source and the very root
the unimaginable root
of where those anxieties really come
from
without any expressed intent
of trying to lessen their anxiety
and that is fundamentally
wildly different
from what anyone is used to that isn't
the world that we live in
can you give me example of somebody's
truth
that you worked with
you know for instance
you know this is an example i give in
the book and it's a common example that
happens with many many people and it's
um
if someone if someone is angry at you
they
slander you
the natural
human reaction is to get upset
and
the natural prescription is
don't get upset
um it's not what they say it's how you
react it's not personal it's not about
it that's right
that's right take five deep breaths and
take you know this just dribble i mean
it's almost it's almost shameful that
people would you know say these things
okay
um
it really is you know the question isn't
well how do i not get upset that isn't
the question
the question is why did the
upsetness
happen
why
from where did it arise
and where that arises from is that when
someone
is
slandered a part of them begins to
entertain the fact
that
they are in fact
what the other person called them
so someone calls someone an idiot
something inside the person begins to
entertain the fact seriously that maybe
you are an idiot
and yeah and then and then
that creates
self-conflict
because the other part of that person
says well no i don't no i'm not
and how can you mean himself
which is really a conversation against
the mind it's mine talking to mind
says well well no i'm not and the other
part of the person says well maybe you
are and that creates internal conflict
and then that internal conflict
manifests itself as anger
now a in order to prove that
if someone called you
uh a
an element yes
no same thing genius would cause
self-conflict too because the part of
you would say you're not a genius
okay so
if someone called if someone called you
an elephant someone called you a horse
right that you're a horse
well you wouldn't really get angry
because there would be no part of you
that would seriously entertain that you
were a horse
and therefore there would be no
self-conflict and all conflict
is self-conflict
so that is a fundamentally different
approach
because it gets down to the truth it
gets down to the source of where the
upsetness so to speak arises
as opposed to
playing the superficial and cosmetic
game
which
essentially perpetuates the problem
no one ever gets over anything by you
saying it isn't about them it isn't
about you it's about them uh don't take
it personally no one ever gets over
no one ever gets that doesn't cure
anybody
okay
um so this does
okay it can a constant revisiting of the
source of one's problems
eventually begins to create an
understanding within a person
which begins to free him from the
problems he's imprisoned to
well if there's something that i have
imprinted uh
in my head from just all of the
conversations we had is something that
you said there is that all conflict is
self-conflict and i want to get to that
in a minute but something was triggered
in my mind
how come most of us
need the approval of other people
because we are not whole
and therefore
we look to
any and all arenas
in order to fill the holes within
ourselves
professional athletes taste this all the
time
they need to win
and winning just to win is one thing
but
no professional athlete wins just to win
everyone looks to the game
looks to the field looks to the court
in order to fill a hole within
themselves
and that is why the only one who can
really play
and the only one who can really live
is the one who arrives arrives whole
when there is no need
there's freedom
is that part of the game so the game
doesn't become
how do i garner and accumulate enough
validation
in order to patch up these holes
the
the real pursuit becomes
how do i become whole
so that i no longer need
to fill up any holes
and what where do i start with that
because one of the things obviously the
great majority of your work starts and
ends with the mind right assuming that
this audience
understands that each of us
at some point or another maybe not all
the time but at some point or another
get in our own way of our own progress
why do we get stuck there why do we get
stuck with our minds
because we believe the mind to be
ourselves
that sounds so damn easy
um
you know everything is easy
it just depends
upon
one's level
of desire
see there is no difficult the difficult
is
what is difficult the difficulty is
making yourself do something that you
don't really want to do
that's difficult
easy is the congruence
of what you're doing with what you
really want to do
this is why everyone says this is
so hard and
well you know
of course it's hard because it's all
penance
everyone subscribes because you know
from religion to education to parents
society's all been taught society has
been teaching human beings for millennia
all that that you have to pay
that you have to
uh
you have to you have to give penance
that you must suffer
that you must work hard and bleed and
sweat in order to get somewhere
and
even if that were true
what has happened is
that man has fallen in love with the
sweat and the blood and the struggle
and he's forgotten all about
why he was struggling in the first place
well the struggle becomes the mantra of
our life
well struggle becomes the goal and
that's exactly what we get back to your
earlier question about prescriptions
the prescription becomes a new goal that
becomes a new god
am i doing it correctly am i doing it
long enough how long must i do it before
it comes
what does it take to change course
desire
sincerity
seriousness
without trying to be
and what the hell does that look like
it looks like the thing that you've
already attained in your life
and the reason that you have them is
because you couldn't live without them
and the reason that you couldn't live
without them
is because you have them
do you think people are afraid of
this wholeness and freedom that you're
talking about do you do you think that
the great majority of us
are
force ourselves to be happy with this
struggle that this is kind of the way
we're supposed to live you know you're
supposed to work really hard in the
world you're supposed nothing is easy
the path to the top this you know paved
with really hard work
is that just
the world that we're creating for
ourselves or is it in our heads
um it's conditioning
um
and
there's no opposing view to the
condition
so i don't know what it is that i do but
some
it's interesting
some have mentioned to me
that what i provide for them and they're
in a much better position to judge what
i do than i am but
um what it is i do for them is give them
an opposing view a sort of sanctuary
uh which is the only place that
in their life they can go
that
is not full of the cultural conditioning
when you when you only hear one
loudspeaker
um
you you
you can't really overcome that
when that's all you hear when that's in
the water well that's the food
when that's in your ear when that's in
front of your eyes day and night for
decades upon decades how can any
reasonable human being be expected
to to say you know that's
everything is wrong
how can
you have to be almost insane
to
seriously entertain that prospect
that everything that you've heard
is false
it's all based upon prescriptions
and lore
and cultural conditioning
once again
you don't
please don't believe anybody especially
not me look at the evidence
so if you just if all these things
worked go ahead have you just taken a
stand that
regardless of what it is you're gonna
just question the oh i i haven't taken a
stand for me to take a stand would be
to
to believe in what i believe i don't
believe in what i believe
i only believe in the evidence
i don't need to take a stand
you don't need to take a stand that the
moon arises in the sky not on the ground
you don't need to take a stand or you
can go outside look
this is this is years of of observing
and seeing
and and witnessing the same patterns
again and again and again and i'm not
the only one
the people who the people who arrive at
the pinnacle of their craft in any field
in any field
they have an inkling of this too
because they tend not to do what others
do
they tend to be contrarian
they tend to be loners
they tend to be against the grain
they tend to be part of the fringe
element
that isn't by accident
you know the the common socializing
um groupie
is not the individual who becomes elite
he gets what everybody else gets
so this is this is in
to a to a small segment segment of the
population
this is not news
but if you walk into any discipline any
arena
and you know nothing about the arena
whether it's engineering or medicine or
sports
or business or finance whatever it is
you can walk into any arena knowing
nothing about it and saying whatever are
your prevailing dogmas and i have no
idea what they are they're wrong
because the majority view is always
wrong
the majority opinion is always wrong
the people that you work with that get
this and the people that you work with
that
share with you that the great
contribution that you make is to be that
opposing view
what does that do to their thinking
you know you ask me too much about what
the the people on the receiving end
think
um i i have to
i don't know i
i don't know things happen you know i
don't
i don't know i mean i i
hear them say things and do things but
you know
once again if i go into that it sounds
it sounds too
um
promotional you know what i mean uh and
and i i don't want to promote really
anything
it
it's it just
happens well you're not promoting
anything because
you're only going to work with the
people that you want to work with anyway
right so it doesn't well interestingly
the people who are here the people who
end up coming people who end up coming
i mean everything seems to self-select
right i mean so when people go to the
website and they read my discourses or
they or they you know subscribe to my
private discourses
when they read the books and they listen
to the podcast
it tends to self-select for a particular
sort of dna of individual
and it it sort of
it sort of
shuns a more
worldly
common thinking individual
so it very much self selects so it isn't
so the people who come tend to come
already
being relatively well vested
in
in what um in being in alignment
with the things that um
that i subscribed to
by virtue of having you know read all of
these things before they came
well speaking of that
your latest discourse or maybe was a
couple weeks ago
really
speaks to that and and it really spoke
to me because you've shared it in some
context here where you talk about this
whole idea of the superhuman
and that all of us
are created equal by way of flesh and
blood but it's the heart within us that
differs greatly
go into that a little bit if you
remember what the hell you wrote
i have no idea what this course we're
talking about um
but the
i'm
the statement that you just mentioned
i'm hearing it for the first time i
might have written it i don't remember
um but but it's true it's it's i guess i
must agree with myself
if i wrote that um
it
it really comes down to the dna of a
particular individual
um you know
what i do in some ways is for everyone
and in some ways really isn't for
everyone and when what i mean by that is
um
we are all human beings and therefore
um these are all
uh
these are the truth about things
uh really arriving somewhere in one's
life is really what we all seek
but we have to first arrive at the place
in which we are desirous of arriving
there
and so that is an evolutionary process
within ourselves and i don't know why
some people
um
truly are are ready for such things and
others
are not
um so in that sense it isn't for
everyone because
um
many are gonna read these things and be
and consider it uh
extraordinarily almost mystical and uh
you know 180 degrees opposite of
of of the world that they're used to
living in and therefore it's just too
much
um so it really comes down to so yeah we
are all flesh and blood we are all
trying to go to the same place by
different names
but it really comes down to the dna of a
particular individual
that determines
whether or not he is ready to
pursue such a journey
but as the old saying goes
i assume you agree with the point of hey
if you find yourself at the side of the
majority if you find yourself following
the crowd you're probably heading the
wrong place true
yes
talk to me about how we deal with
attachment at some point we all face it
we all deal with it
we're all dealing with it right now
it's human
yeah
i mean
that's i mean that's a wonderful
question and it really
um
no you have really raised a
a fundamental seat
of
um
of
human misery
and
human strife i like that human human
misery i like that
absolutely um you know the buddhist the
buddhists say uh you know do not be
attached and
and the gurus say do not be attached and
uh
and
and all it's it's absolutely true
but
it's kind of like saying be present
or just be
and those are
those are really more cosmetic
you know
silly comments
um
it isn't about not being attached
because you can't not be something
because if you try to not be something
you will drift into prescription land
and you will get nowhere
it is about seeing the belly of the
beast
it is about seeing the eyes and the
teeth in the glare
you do not need to fix anything
you need to see
everything
so when one truly sees
only then does a journey towards
non-attachment even become possible
a person who was trying to become
unattached by prescriptive means
it is not possible for him to even enter
the journey
to becoming unattached
because he will never escape the vortex
of the prescription
it is not about what do i do
it is about seeing the devastation it is
about seeing the shrapnel
it is about seeing
the chaos
that ensues on account of attachment
not listening to anybody not hearing
some book say that you should not be
attached
those things will not do anything for
you because we as human beings do not
act unless our backs are against a wall
and the only way that our backs become
against a wall
is if we truly see
knowledge is not powerful enough
to make one change
neither is the empty idea of health
health isn't enough
there has to be something in it for me
for the human
and that something better be deep
only then will he commit without trying
to commit
he will commit when he has no choice
not because good for him
well i bring that up because as we at as
we tape this
you know there's a an incredible
catastrophe going on here in southern
california that we're living through
right now you know people's homes are
devastated these fires are going crazy
uh lives you know every day that the
number of lives that are being lost is
going up and i was having a conversation
this morning with somebody who actually
lost their home here in malibu
and
i was very impressed with
the
i don't want to say the lack of
attachment but
that it took a few days that but he came
to grips with the fact
that everything i had is gone
i'm not happy about it
but
at least i'm still here and i have the
capability to replace it
and when you talk about this issue with
a lot of people
it's a tough one it's a really tough one
when they're going through what they're
going through
and that's why i wanted to get your
perspective on it what message would you
have
for
people that are going through that here
right now where one day you're sleeping
in your bed and a couple of hours later
everything that you own is gone
there's no message i can give
there's no there's no
message i can give to suit someone or to
make them feel better or to make them
feel comfortable comforted or
to make the pain any less there's
nothing i can say
but is there something that you can say
about this whole idea of attachment
would be would you
look as upset
or maybe upset is not the right word
uh would we be as impacted
if we weren't as attached
well no but but that's
but the only reason that you're asking
that question is because
a person's house burned down
right exactly what i'm going to what i
what i what i want what i want to hear
you ask is
okay let's say no one's house burned
down
you wouldn't be asking me that question
because it's easier to talk about okay
at that point because it just well
well well because well because i would
argue i would argue
that it's no small thing for someone's
house to burn down and lose everything
of course that's devastating it's no
small thing it shouldn't be taken
lightly i'm all with that
but i will say i will argue this
it is far more devastating
to live every day of one's life
under the weight of attachment without
even knowing it
and i would say most of them feeling
living
absolutely so the question arises there
you don't need to wait for someone's
house to burn down the house has already
burned down a thousand times over
it is the recognition of what attachment
has done to us as human beings on a
fundamental
day-to-day level
that is the real catastrophe
what are we starting not not according
to not according to a particular event
no matter how devastating it is which it
is
but
it is far more devastating
to live
70 years
under the weight of attachment
no doubt it ruins it ruins it ruins the
quality of one's life
because one lives under fear anxiety
pain misery strife hope disappointment
failure
that
that becomes
part and parcel of one's life
that becomes the only thing he knows
what's the alternative
the alternative is freedom
from the mind
freedom
from attachment
freedom
from seeking
freedom from hope
freedom
from wishing that tomorrow will be
better than today
and therefore never really arriving at
tomorrow
well we've definitely experienced that
here for some people for a lot of people
who hasn't
everyone experiences that everyone lives
there
the real tragedy isn't death
the real tragedy is life
what are some things that we can do to
start to
live
a life
of freedom i'm not gonna say get there
because
i don't think we're there yet but what
are what are some steps that we can
start to take
so we can start to lose that
well i don't think that there's a we
anything there's no we
there's probably
there might be three people there might
be three people who are listening to
this podcast
who might become ready at some point in
their life
okay so there's no we anything it really
comes down to not doing anything at all
it is
it is understanding
that your problems will never go away
no matter how elaborate the fix
the technique
or the methodology may be
you cannot escape your problems
and because you cannot escape your
problems
you will live a life of torment and
anxiety interspersed by a few joyful
moments
that will be your life
the only way out of
that is for what i just said
to absolutely not be okay
all right so let me end with this what
are you most optimistic about
nothing i don't believe in optimism
what are you looking forward to
nothing
i'm not looking forward to anything
i do not want
i do not want tomorrow to bring me
something
because if i want that i'm going to keep
looking over there
so
if i have a journey
if i have a devotion
it is to become 100
totally and completely free
of all imprisonments of my mind
and on a scale of one to five where are
you
no i know an impossible question to
answer
i i
i am five
with regard to my level of devotion
and is that all that counts right now
that's the only thing that really works
all right well i'm going to cheat and
ask you one more question people want to
know do you set goals
no
do you believe in setting goals if
you're running a company and you're
running a public company i have to have
some
something for people to look forward to
i think that relates to
why you started it in the first place
what is the thing that you truly want
to achieve
a vision
what is your arrival
and that is a
that is not as easy as a question as if
they sound of course because
the arrival has far more to do
with the deepest sense
of unmitigated
satisfaction
than it does with achieving
a sense of pleasure
that is
i think that
gets to the essence
of the matter
well that's pretty appropriate um
obviously we can sit here for hours but
i think most importantly
what i hope that we did with this
segment is address some of the key
questions that people have
and you know i will continue to
encourage anyone
that
listens to our work or subscribes to our
work to
do yourself a favor and
dig a little bit deeper into kapil's
work
not only his books and his discourses
but take some time to reflect to journal
to really try to capture
the messages that he's trying to tell
because
for me personally i mean one thing that
sticks to me is this whole idea that you
said all problems are
problems of the mind
there is no conflict everything is
self-conflict i've tried to come to
grips with that but you know i'm about
as candid as anybody it's really
difficult
and maybe i'm over complicating it but
uh you know when i see the work that you
do i'm inspired
to
try to get to that level of desire that
that you talk about so for people that
are listening do you have any parting
words
no how come i knew that was going to
happen
but i thought it might be fun for us to
start about to talk a little bit about
the michael jordan docu-series that the
world's talking about have you been uh
keeping up with that
uh i've seen it
does it speak to you at all
um
i mean the the
you know jordan himself of what he
achieved and those kind of things i
think is very
highly impressive and whenever you see
so that kind of mania that kind of
obsession you know to become the best in
the world
there's always great things that come
come from that and obviously you know
michael's done some really inspirational
things
when you're watching it
i guess it's been eight eight episodes
now like what do you look for in
something like that i mean obviously
everybody has an idea of of
the greatness that this guy has but are
you are you paying attention to certain
things about maybe the manner in which
he does what he does
you know
it's a good question because if you look
at the exposition of
people who have done great things in
their life um
it's just like anywhere else it's very
difficult to find truth and the reason
for that is it's very there really is no
market for truth in that regard
everyone's interested in sensationalism
and
so unfortunately human humans being
humans they tend to draw out the worst
in people and
so as a result all whenever you have
books written or media done or all these
things it really never is about
the meaty things it's always about the
sensationalism and
you know the lowest common denominator
type type of type of stuff what what is
what would be really intriguing is if
people went into you know
if documentaries and books
about people really went into not how
many records and how many wins i mean
everyone knows that you can
you can google that and find that out in
five minutes there's no reason to do a
documentary about that i mean it really
is about
um
you know the the
the genesis of the obsession the nature
of the training the
um
what is it that drives a particular
human being
from a very very uh honest perspective
as opposed to trying to give a lesson or
trying
to sensationalize and trying to put on a
pedestal and trying to do all of these
things
just to sell newspapers so to speak and
uh unfortunately that really doesn't
exist in today's today's world and
that's because
uh the both the supply and the demand
are
chasing each other in other words the
you know the
the audience craves
one type of sensationalism and then the
media is a slave to that
in order to sell more papers and so um
no one's really interested in in the
things that could really benefit human
human beings um as to what the truth
actually was right
no one tells you the truth right they
always tell you they
they always tell you the sensationalized
uh aversion
so that it becomes more dramatic and so
that more people will buy the paper
yeah the media is awful
well but yeah but i can't blame the
media
the media doesn't provide what human
beings don't want so
there's no way that i'll i'll blame
the the media for that
um
the the
the one
you know the one who was willing to tell
the truth is the one who's willing to go
out of business
and
that actually is worth watching
and
so
i can i can actually
come along with the idea of
media responsibility but it really isn't
responsibility but let's say that you
had a media
you can't say outlet because
anything more than one person there's no
truth i mean groups are nonsense
so
let's say that you had a rare individual
who was interested who was obsessed with
getting the truth out not sensationalism
but the actual truth
about
a particular figure or an event or
whatever it is knowing that
he may not sell a lot of newspapers and
hot dogs and that wasn't his driving
force that would actually be very
nourishing to human beings because
number one finally we have a truth right
uh number two we have someone who knows
how to tell us sell us something on an
idea not you know
there's no nothing wrong with selling
something in fact it's worth ten times
more if it's truthful
um
uh but and if that happened
then you would actually create an
audience
um who was
enamored by that
and you would actually teach people in a
way
to
seek more of the truth
as opposed to more sensationalism
well obviously i can't help but think
about you when i watch it just knowing
how you think and knowing the the
conversations that we've had and
obviously kapil no one would argue that
michael has an incredibly rare dna but
as everybody's talking i'm thinking
about how you might be able to look at
it from no you know his greatness is his
greatness but i'm curious as to what
someone like him is able to access
to achieve that level of greatness that
maybe the rest of us aren't willing to
go there or perhaps it seems elusive to
us
nothing is really elusive
the only
elusive implies that you really want it
and that you can't get it
and that's just not true
no one really wants it and no
and no one should want it and once again
the audience that's listening to this
shouldn't be listening it's not for them
right i have nothing to say to them
right i'm not i once again we go through
this theme
i don't want to give any lessons right i
don't want any take-home messages that
they should do
um because the fact of the matter is is
rare people are rare
and to try to be like them as a waste of
time um
emulation is a waste of time
if if someone is really interested in
something they will find themselves
doing it
they don't need a podcast to motivate
them
and if they do
then that'll be gone that motivation
will be gone by 5 p.m
well it's a little bit after 5 so
hopefully it hasn't gone yet
well it'll be five tomorrow so it
doesn't matter it will be five tomorrow
yeah so but it really isn't about
lessons it's it's it's if you
you know if if something that you
if it's something that speaks to you it
speaks to you if it doesn't it doesn't
but there's no you should do this
so so here's here's something that
somebody once wanted me to ask you if
life has granted you a beautiful gift or
talent
what is your obligation to use it
nothing nothing
no one has any obligation
responsibility i knew you were going to
say that about that yes absolutely
yeah the question makes me angry
there's no obligation
okay so let's talk a little bit about
that you've been doing a lot of writing
and you've been doing a lot of uh a lot
of podcasts
that uh you know really do speak
directly to the truth and one of the
areas that you talk about is confidence
and you take a look at the world today
and there's a lot of people in the world
who've been impacted that their
confidence has been shaken over the past
few months
what has to happen
for someone who's had these confidence
shaken or who's had these bad defeats in
life
what do they have to go through to be
able to restore that
well everyone views things through the
events of the world
no i i don't
once again
there's nothing they can there's nothing
they can do to get the confidence
there's nothing they can do nothing
there's nothing they can do to get
uh
you know what michael achieved
nothing there's nothing they can do
and the reason there's nothing they can
do is because nothing can be sprinkled
upon anybody
so once again you you did it again and
that's why i asked you if you heard me
you don't
you tend
once again we're talking openly mo i'm
not i'm not bashing you i'm loving it
okay okay okay so we're talking openly
and
you tend to ask questions then i answer
the question then you go on to the next
question
and it's almost like you're in the
middle of the next question before you
even heard the response to the first one
and it isn't that my words are so
important that you need to listen to
them
but
when you ask the next question
it's asked as if you never heard the
response to the first one
and therefore the framework hasn't
changed
it's still you're still asking to help
people
and i i know and i'm not at that and i'm
i don't want you to get better and i
don't even want you to stop all i'm
saying is i'm not interested
i'm not interested in helping anyone so
how do you look at confidence
what is it what does that even mean to
you
i don't think it's about where to get
confidence from
i think i think it's about
where one's desire what direction one's
desire is in and if it even exists
not that it should
so at a point when you're at the lowest
point in your life yeah you're at the
lowest point of your life always
you're not your lowest point of your
life too because of corona
you're always at the lowest point of
your life just a detail
you're always suffering
show me a human being who wasn't
suffering
it's just more details of suffering so
this pick-me-up
you know this boost thing
this live in my mood
it's it's an insult it's a waste
i i agree i yeah no i don't think
if you were tired of it then i would say
that you wouldn't have asked me the
question if you were really tired of it
you wouldn't have asked me for for the
pick-me-up well it's not a pick-me-up
the quote it
it is if someone's at the lowest point
in their life how can how you know what
can i say that will give them more
confidence who cares
whatever whatever if
whatever
someone needs in the lowest point
and then they need it only then
then whenever
the so-called economy comes back and
everything they'll be back to where
their default state
everyone's always falling
the people who really get somewhere are
the ones who are trying to get there
even when they're not following
not when they have fallen then they look
up to for for a helping hand
but would you still would you agree that
there's
you know at some point somebody will use
whatever crisis they are in their life
to shake them enough to be able to
pursue maybe a different yeah a crisis a
crisis absolutely for the for
for some people a christ a crisis can
absolutely shake you and it can change
you there's no question about it but
that doesn't come from a pick-me-up
the crisis the crisis itself will do
that
that doesn't come from that doesn't come
from crisis plus prescription
no there's only crisis if the crisis is
going to do something it's going to be
crisis equals change it's not going to
be crisis plus prescription equals
change
i agree
but it but at some point do you think
that
you know when somebody's dealing
and i've got some people who are very
good friends who've lost very
significant businesses
it's very difficult not to assume that
they're shaken that their confidence are
shaken that their minds playing mind
games with themselves and at some point
they have to pick themselves up it's
it's their own responsibility
all of that is all of that is true
why why wouldn't
of course they would be shaken anyone
would
but
that's that's a that's a statement of
fact
but what becomes non-fact
is when you say what can you say to help
them
that that's that's that's a farce
that's what everything
you know that's when everything falls
apart
so let's not talk about helping them
let's talk about the last time maybe you
faced a crisis
was there a turning point that enabled
you to cross over to the other side and
just become a different version of
yourself
i don't think it's about turning points
i don't think it's about these
supernova
type of
you know um
events that happen and then things
change
that's a that's a very that's a
very uh that's a media myth that
everyone likes to ask you know at what
point in your life did you that's all
just for cameras it's not true nothing
ever happens in one point
um
it
the
how crisis
really can
um make a huge impact on someone's life
is
when they examine the crisis
when the crisis makes them look inward
as opposed to when the crisis makes them
try to do something to feel better
or to or to get out of the crisis
so
when someone and everyone is having
crisis after crisis after crisis
and the more that one becomes acutely
aware of the fact
that he is having one crisis after
another
that
is the person whom it will have
a
the possibility of a more lasting impact
on as opposed to the person who says
this is my latest crisis how can i get
out of it
so there there it's an internal
examination
yeah but it's but it's not a do not but
it's not a doing
i don't want no it's not about internal
exam everything that you say
drips with the blood of doing
right
it's an internal so now go internally
examine i mean it's no i'm saying the
person who does
is the person who can um
who
has the possibility of achieving a
lasting benefit
from a crisis
the person who does not the person who
was told to do not the person who was
suggested that they should do
the person who already does
not because they were told to but
because something in them just did
but don't you think that
at some point if somebody's listening to
something or reading something that you
did and that ignites that flame if it if
it ignites if it ignites the flame
that's only because they were at a ready
certain degree of of
internal evolution to where it ignites
you are correct
um there are things that can get someone
over the hill
and over the hump that is correct that
does absolutely does happen
but but but that never comes but that'll
come through the hearing of the words
not through the hearing of any advice
yeah well let's assume we're not giving
anybody advice we're having a
conversation right and and but but all
but all of your questions are centered i
can't help it advice
right but no i don't know no no no i
don't want you to help it
i i just have to answer with silence
then because it i i'm not interested no
well i i appreciate that right i i
really do appreciate it and and the
reason that i can't help it is because i
immediately
start to picture people who are dealing
with if there's anything we could
do to to at least offer some insight for
good advice it would help so okay let me
ask you let me ask you something about
the questions that you're asking
yourself
when you're when you're getting closer
to that sense of freedom or the truth
give me an example of some of the
questions that you're asking yourself
let's
let's let's let's talk the truth okay
let's let's let's talk the truth
okay
the vast majority
nine point
eight percent okay so now maybe
maybe it's maybe it's 99.9 it doesn't
matter
of the people listening
and of the people all the people in the
world
are going to die
never having arrived at truth
are going to die never having arrived at
wholeness or realization or whatever the
word is and whatever the word is in
their own words whatever that thing is
and they may call it happiness they may
call it peace whatever the word is
th everyone virtually everyone is going
to die
um
not having
got that thing in any
consistent or sustainable fashion okay
so if that is the case
then
it really is only about speaking the
truth
and not trying
to help
because if you try to help you are
sprinkling it upon
the unhelpable
and that's why
this advice and what do you recommend
and how can we help so and so
it's it's just it's just not true
it's not true and if it isn't true why
waste time doing it
right so i would say that the
the most impactful thing about this
podcast for instance
would not be about the people
it would be about you
not that you need help not that you
should change not nothing
no you're not
because every single question is about
the people
that's just not true that's just not
true and i'm not saying that you should
i'm just saying that's just that is not
to say that's why you're doing it
the the the your behavior
speaks otherwise
yeah it's it i'm trying to speak for
myself but at the same time not uh not
think of others
yeah there is no thinking of others that
sounds very nice but it's not
and no one thinks of others so that
thinking of others is just
more advice sprinkling everyone's in
everyone's interested in themselves
that's why everyone's wired there's no
thing no thing is selfish or unselfish
everyone is wired
um to view and to seek
and to biologically crave their own
sense of well-being so when you're when
you're recording your solo podcasts
what are you talking about the latest
ones you know the latest direct are you
the director of itself yeah or what what
is
you there's there's some wonderful
topics there are these are you having
conversations with yourself and just
sharing no others
well what i'm doing i'm not really
sharing
i'm
i enjoy
taking a topic
and then
um
basically
getting a dart and throwing it directly
into the heart of that topic
i enjoy i enjoy
that
discovery
i enjoy that
no fluff
no intro music
right no nonsense
uh in fact
at some point
those direct truth podcasts probably
will be 30 seconds long
because there will be so
there won't be a single wasted letter
because there's no time to waste
um
just just what it says direct truth no
fluff no no time waste
no
intro no talk about obvious
nonsense that everyone already knows get
to the point
in and out this is what it is not that
you should do it not that you shouldn't
do it couldn't care less
if you change don't bother me one bit
if you don't change doesn't bother me
one bit
but i like the communion
i enjoy the communion
between the topic and the absolute
raw direct truth of that topic
so ignoring anyone who might be
listening and theoretically you're just
basically having a conversation with
yourself and if somebody likes it or or
listens great if they don't they don't i
don't know who i'm having a conversation
with all i'm saying is that
i am just uh i just enjoy the the
throwing of that arrow
into the heart of that
topic and and do you do any preparation
no so you show up in the top and then
you just go
yeah i just i don't it isn't so much
that i go
it comes
so can you give me a glimpse of what
somebody could expect when and i've got
several of them here that that i've put
up in in front of me the first
understanding to become world class that
topic just emerges in your head and you
hit record and you just absolutely it's
all there
it's all there i'm not
like i'm not reciting it
it's just coming from somewhere else
through me
so what does what does that first
understanding look like for somebody who
wants to be world class
i don't even remember what i said i know
that that's why i'm asking yeah um
i don't know i can't answer that
question i wouldn't
i wouldn't i don't even know what i said
it
you know everything i think that if you
if someone is truly serious they'll
they'll get away from the house and the
how-to's and they'll naturally be more
inclined and more attracted to finding
out what it is that they truly want
first
let me ask you about something that a
lot of people are dealing with but i
think more importantly that i'm
interested and curious and how you i
know that your preferred method of work
is isolation and how you write in when
you do these podcasts when you do these
interviews but if you have to work with
the team
how do you handle yourself you're making
me you're making me cringe
um what what do you mean by you have to
work with a team let's assume you get
this amazing opportunity to work with a
world-class team of athletes that are
five of them in a room right and they
you know they're in a quest to win some
amazing championship and you know they'd
like to to have you kind of observe what
they do and and maybe see what they
can't see
you know i don't think that you can look
at a group of people
look there's not five if you have five
people all in chicago bulls there's not
five michael jordans
there's only one sure yeah okay so
so there's no way that i would talk to
the other four
the same way i talked to him
that's why there's no there's no team
i mean they're they're they're
technically there technically is a team
in the most mechanical sense
but it is the
allegiance to each person's
own
role
that and that individuality of that role
which then by inference allows the quote
team to work
and i think so everybody sees that but
if you were their coach i don't think so
i don't think everybody sees that
i don't think so well not for
so you don't think that at least this
docu-series has revealed that uh he was
at a different stratosphere than
everybody else
no but that's not what i said i'm
talking about
viewing the idea of team through
individuality as opposed to through team
but if you're their coach wouldn't i
mean how do you handle that
what what's what what's there to handle
you're gonna be you have to be specific
like
you can't just say how do you handle
what like it isn't you don't just open
the door and say
what do i do i mean how do you handle
the team meeting like let's say you guys
had a shitty night before and you're
talking but that but but that's more
specific like
there's no handling of anything so
so if there was a
if if there was a lack of performance
then it would come down to first of all
the lack of performance really doesn't
have anything to do with the players
asking them
it is
the coach who's insightful and incisive
he will see the issues himself he won't
need
he will need their input only on a very
specific basis
and
there's this team meeting stuff
i just this board meeting stuff
i know that it's just not not it's it's
i don't think you you say that you know
those but you don't because you ask
those very questions that you say you
know about because how do you you can't
escape it that's that's the way the
world is wired
no if i would if i was the head of the
bulls i would i probably i may i may
have a team meeting i may not
i don't i don't know but i but there's
no way that i would walk in there with
the idea that that's just the way the
world i couldn't give a crap about the
world
if i was told if i was told that
that
you have to by the gm
that you have to have a team meeting
i i wouldn't i would i would leave
like i don't
it depends upon what you cannot force
things upon creativity upon art
right so what that that's the way it's
done in fact if it's the way it's done
that's totally wrong
just by virtue of the fact it's done
that way everything is wrong the way
it's done
so if anything you do the exact complete
opposite
first without even looking into it first
do opposite
so
the way that you think is the way that
everybody thinks you're just supposed to
have a team meeting why just because
you're supposed to why because you're
supposed to why but you're supposed to
i don't walk in with any supposed to's i
know you you know i i might i might make
them hang upside down from the you know
from the ceiling
i don't know what i would do
i would but
i don't have any preconceived things
because i don't do things in
conventional ways
i believe i believe i believe in
extracting art
from the human
and in order to extract art from a human
you cannot approach him in traditional
ways
because the mind will eat tradition up
so nothing would be traditional
we might so-called practice
in a river i don't know
whatever it requires the situation would
dictate to me and whatever arose within
me
organically that's what would happen
when i when i
when i go see a
pro athlete this happened happens on a
regular basis i know it does i have no
idea what i'm going to say
i have no briefcase i have no powerpoint
i have no clue
i won't know if i'm if i go on a stage
or if i do a podcast or if i i have no
idea ever what i'm going to say but i
never go in with this idea that
team meeting is a must why it's supposed
to
so i i reject the entire notion like
out of the gate i can't even answer the
question
because the assumptions upon which it is
based
i don't consider as valid
i think that i think the most team
meetings i think
that businesses waste billions
on these stupid board meetings
they're just a waste of time
now i know what you're going to ask
because everyone's going to ask the same
thing but it's not going to do you any
good to hear anything because you're
still locked into well that's the way
it's supposed to be
and since we have to have a board
meeting then you'll ask well if you
don't have a board meeting then how can
you ever get anything done
well my point is
if you have a board meeting how could
you ever get anything done
no one gets anything done
the the inefficiencies
the time waste
is so
catastrophic
that the only reason that people aren't
jumping off of buildings because of it
is because they're all in the same boat
everyone does it
so it is a
it is a group psychosis
well there's some people some people are
jumping off buildings but we don't well
not enough
no one sees that
not enough
so so i want to get at how do you handle
perform repeated poor performance issues
with an athlete by finding the cause
and is are you sitting there asking
questions or are you observing
um
or both
usually if i observe i can usually tell
even if it's a sport that you you you
know routinely oh it doesn't have
nothing that's commonly hence the
swimming coach right yeah yeah nothing
yeah i don't
the technicality of the sport is
irrelevant it's totally irrelevant
it's very easy to see
it's very it's not difficult to see
what's going on
at least to get to a fairly specific
area and then from there when you need
input from the individual then you
then you really painstakingly go into
his mind and you ask questions that turn
his mind inside out
and he begins to
almost in a trance-like state give to
you
the the truth about what's really going
on and as he gives it to you he hears it
himself
now what are you gonna do with that
right what are you gonna put that on the
on the bulletin board
that's not gonna that isn't how people
think
so
mostly things that i say are like way
out there
because if there's because they're so
wildly divorced from convention
they're not even the same zip code
and that's why
when you ask me conventional questions
and you ask them in order to provide
help to people it is not going to help
them because both the assumptions that
the questions are based upon are flawed
and the thing that i'm going to say is
not going to be in their experience
so the only person who can learn the
truth is the one who has no preconceived
notions
he doesn't walk in saying since i know
there has to be a team meeting okay
that's a given that that's i'm not
getting rid of that
now
holding that firmly in place
tell me what you would say in a team
meeting
i would say no without no team meeting
forget the assumptions
i'm not saying i wouldn't have a team
meeting i'm not saying i would have a
team meeting
what i am rejecting is the assumptions
that you have to
yeah and hey man i totally get it i mean
the overwhelming majority of them not
only are a waste of time but a waste of
energy
well
if that was true then why do you have
group meetings
i don't have them as often as you think
but yeah okay so you're right you don't
right so you're no no no no no no no but
but here's what
here's what i'm trying to get across
you're not wrong for doing so
i'm saying i am saying
that
i am i am putting your words back on you
right so if you say
that they're most of them are a waste of
time and yet you still have them that
doesn't mean that you're a hypocrite not
at all
it's not about the doing it's not about
the action it is that if you really
believed that they were a waste of time
then you wouldn't be having them
so the point is not that you're wrong
for doing it
or that you're not following your own
advice all that nonsense
it is
the very fact that you do
means that you believe that they're
worthy
at times yeah and as i'm hearing you
talk i'm thinking you know perhaps it's
a talent issue perhaps that you know i
don't have the world-class team that's
able to be self-sustaining and to be
you know to to pursue their own
greatness
you know that's well yeah i mean and i i
don't think there's no world-class team
first of all there's a world-class
people there's no world-class team
um
the good point
so
but
it is that the individual has to be not
has to be if the individual is
completely outside the box and does
things in a completely unconventional
way
then he has to be before those who are
also
uh given to unconventional things right
and so the the
the the the relationship the
between the two
parties so to speak
has to be on the same page dna wise
right so if the so-called team is wholly
conventional
and then you come in with total
unconventionalness
then you have one of two choices either
you cower
or you do things the way you want to do
in which case you probably leave
so
so yeah that that marriage
has to be there right in one way or the
other
if your boys weren't your boys
and
their parents came to you and said hey
we've got two kids who've got we feel
have the opportunity to do amazing
things in golf and we'd like for you to
coach them would you
well the honest answer is i don't know
but
what i will say is that
there is in many ways
a
um
it is
it is on
to some degree it is unfortunate
that they have me for a father
yeah
of course
yeah
you're always going to be speaking in
their ear
well
i think distance
is i think distance and um
unfamiliar
is has a definite place
and
so
if you
happen to have come
or
some discoveries have found you
let's say
uh some truths have found you
that you've been you know they you've
become privy to
then it's actually helpful to have more
distance
um than to have more
familiarity
because
the flow of that information is more
effective
so if they weren't family
and you saw this in north you know the
next version of tiger woods
and their parents you were close to
their parents and they wanted you to in
whatever capacity
to coach them
would something like that appeal to you
probably not
number one
they're kids
um i don't i don't really coach kids
number two
uh the the things that i
the places that i go
one has to be ready
to go
and
um very few are willing to to go there
and
if i have a parent to deal with
then i'm going to have to explain some
things and i don't want to explain first
of all they won't get it
and i don't i don't i don't i don't want
to have any any middlemen
i don't deal with middlemen right so
so the best people and they're very very
rare
the individuals who truly
for whatever reason
are interested in learning
and not just intellectually but they
either because they've reached a certain
point in their life by way of age
or they've reached a certain point in
their life by way
of circumstance where they have
everything but then don't have anything
so to speak um
or they're just their dna
you know it leads them in that direction
to really want to know before they die
to not have to not waste a life
to use every opportunity of whatever
life you have left
to not waste
the remainder of it
is something that has that for some
people
really grabs them by the throat and for
which they're willing to do
anything for that not to happen because
they really value
that
i only have x number of years left
and
i really want my life to have gone
somewhere i really want to have
experienced i really want to have
arrived somewhere in my life
so that it wasn't a total struggle the
entire way with nothing to show for it
so you don't think an 18 or 20 year
old's ready for that mindset it depends
upon
the 18 or 20 year old but it's very rare
um
it's it's very rare
and
particularly in today's environment i
mean we've talked about this before
today's you know alcohol guzzling
environment
of just
just a very
uh degraded human existence
you know the worst i think the worst
conditions
that um
any generation has ever seen the level
of degradation
it's
you got to be a pretty rare person to
overcome that
yeah that that that sort of influence
so do you ever think about success
not really
it's a pretty open question
like how about wealth or money is that
that ever
you don't really do anything about that
right you don't talk much about it does
that mean anything to you
it does i mean
what's the truth the truth is that
if you wish to live in society you need
money
and money provides definitely
a lot of benefits um
it allows you to do what you want to do
but aside from that
one truth
it money doesn't really
inspire me it's never it doesn't for you
no i mean it
it is from you know money is there like
it's a it's a
you know it's a ghost in the corner
right that everyone needs some
right to live in the world
um but just
from just from that basic necessity
standpoint
like there's nothing that i do that i'm
driven by money to do absolutely not i
mean that
that in fact i'm driven by
you know if someone wants
you know
to read what i have or to whatever it is
that
that they should have skin in the game
that means yeah that means something to
me absolutely
don't come to me asking stuff for free
um
but
from the standpoint of
you know me cashing a check
i i
i can't think of anything more
uninspiring to me
it just doesn't do it for me i'm not i'm
not saying that's good or bad right the
person who's driven by money that's not
bad
i'm just saying that's just not
that i'm it just isn't there
well i think it's it's pretty clear in
just for people who at least follow you
and and have gotten to know you through
your writing and so forth and when
somebody does write a check to to you
know whether it's to hear the podcast or
whether to be a pr part of your private
discourses i think what that means more
than anything for you is that at least
you have somebody who's willing to who's
at least a little bit more serious than
everybody else sure yes that's right
couple things that i read that i want
you to comment on
every person in your life is hindering
you in ways that you will never know
absolutely that's absolutely true
in every way in every way
you do you you'll
do you trust and and i guess
do i trust
it depends what you mean by trust
trust the integrity of some people
around you
i mean if everybody's hindering you last
time we talked a little bit about it
from the standpoint of attachment right
well well they're everyone everyone is
hindering you
not because they're trying to physically
block you
they're hindering you because
they're not of the dna that's going to
accelerate you
that's how that's how they're they're
hindering you
not by what they do but by who they are
so do you just not have any friends
unless they fall into that 0.001
who me
yeah
or do you mean like do you mean you like
in general or do you mean are you asking
me i'm asking you
no i don't have any friends
well there's and they're 0.001
right
yeah
relationships i'm i i'm a total loner
hermit
i mean the only difference is that i i
literally i
i don't live in a in a cave but you
won't but but but i do live in a cave
figuratively
right but you work with people people
come to i do but very little i do i do
but you know
i think eventually that's going to go
away too
i'm sure
yeah i don't i don't really have a lot
of interest in talking to people
um
i i it
for me it's it's it's very much like my
time
is so
taken
um by
the
devotion to
ultimate truth and everything
it's not a good thing like i'm not
saying it's a good thing i really mean
that it's not a good thing it just
it wasn't my choice
um but everything goes so deeply into
that
i really don't
i don't really have an interest in
anything else
if i were to ask the boys how would they
describe
their dad
how do you think they'd respond
i think it's a very good question
and i don't think that i'm
fit to answer that question i don't know
you don't really know what people would
say
you don't know
you only know how you you only know how
you think in your own totally completely
biased way right as as a human being
you never really know
what got across
what did not get across
um
what in what
impression was
created
and not that it matters
right because the truth of the matter is
you're a huge part of their life
yeah yeah but i i can't i'm not going
down that road
because
these are like good housekeeping type
articles it just doesn't go anywhere
you know every parent does for their
kids
okay every parent provides for their
children every parent wants the best for
their children there's no there's no
specialness here it's just a biological
drive i mean it you know um
so there's nothing there's nothing
special that i did i mean
it's very it's very easy to sort of fall
into that idea of
um
what a parent has done for the children
no matter how much time and so forth and
how much of their life they've
devoted and
you know even if they devote their
entire life
but that was all done because the parent
wanted to right it's not a it can't be a
view to the lens of good and bad and um
and altruism versus selfishness
um
so i don't
yeah
this is one of those topics once again
that it's it's um it's considered sacred
but nothing is sacred i mean because
it's
sacred means that you put a wall around
it and you don't really examine the real
truth of it no matter how much
it may be you know it may make you feel
uncomfortable
um but
this idea
that
the parent is a huge part of the child's
life i think that's much more the case
when they're small
um
but
i don't
i think the person who asks that
question perhaps hasn't really seen life
for what it is mo
i don't i don't
i don't think people see
i think people really have rose-colored
glasses on
life is not what you think
your your life and not just you i mean
just a human being's life
it's not
it's not this one plus one equals two
and i know you're gonna agree with that
but don't agree so quickly like
it's
it's not this like
you do all this good stuff and then they
do all good for you and because you did
good you
it's not like that
life is like this jagged edge
that is uh the t's don't get crossed
necessarily and the eyes don't get
dotted and
you can give everything and get nothing
so people won't like to look at it that
way because they like closure and they
like to
write textbooks in which the bold type
says that you know x leads to y
that just isn't reality
capillary certain skills that you think
best serves you in life
what do you mean just so there's certain
skills like when you think about
you know the skills that we acquire and
and i look at your kids and i look at my
kids at their stage in life
and you think about the skills that they
need to have to best serve them in the
future
do you ever think about that do you feel
like there's certain skills that are
going to be that are going to equip them
to to have a better future than others
well the the question started off
really nicely
but then it became a teaching again
pretending because then you then you use
the word equip
right right pretend you didn't hear that
so the um no don't edit it out because
it's important for everyone to hear that
um
yeah absolutely there is a skill
and
but that skill isn't really a
a physical skill it's an understanding
and that is
that
all your friends are stupid
and that you really don't have any
friends
and that all those who call you their
friend
are not
and that all those that you associate
with are acquaintances
and any reliance upon anyone is only
going to lead you to absolute pain i
don't care how much of a optimist you
are and how much of your life you spend
in the self-help section under positive
thinking
um
that's just camouflage
that's just damage control
but
even having said all that it won't do
anything for anybody
because
even if someone
canceled all their friends after hearing
that i wouldn't do anything
because they'd be doing it
prescriptively secondly no one's ever
gonna do that thirdly it is only the
person
who has had that experience
to whom it could actually reach
hey read to me
okay
yeah that's just the absolute truth this
idea of
friendship and you know associations and
i go to
meet so-and-so and talk to so-and-so
every one of those people will
disappoint you on a regular basis
throughout your entire life and when you
meet a new friend he's going to be the
exact same way
and what must be understood
and i'm not saying this to be nice
god forbid
what what must be understood
is that
it is not their fault it is no one's
fault
no one is trying to be
to disappoint you
it is just that
you have to view the human creature as
the human creature
if you see a human creature as someone
who is
under the the category of friend
then you will ascribe to him
characteristics
for which he is not capable
therefore
that can only result
in disappointment
so if it's anyone's fault
it's the persons
for ascribing that upon someone now it
isn't even his fault
it's not a fault
it's just a lack of understanding
well i mean so if so if a young person
understands that let's say by some you
know cosmic flash that the point zero
zero two one percent no zero percent
okay
zero percent okay
of the people that they call friend of
the people that they lean upon that they
depend upon
that they hope to have a good time with
and waste their lives
they are dragging
them down
they will lead only to disappointment
net net result net result
um
if that was like
by way of syringe
being you know able to be implanted in
someone
there's your so-called skill
you have no idea
of the plutonium bomb magnitude of that
skill
well that disappointment a lot of times
leads to anger that anger i mean leads
to bad yeah it's all it's all in
the same it's all under the same
umbrella yeah all that pain strife
anxiety and then that leads to conflict
and then absolutely yeah that whole
that whole thing
um
being around other people
is
an incredible liability
and and no one should listen to that
it's not going to help you to listen to
that
i'm just thinking speaking the way
things are
but what it could do is help somebody
start to examine their own life sure it
could it could like that yeah it could
absolutely it's the one who's had that
experience especially
so he doesn't have to take it on faith
yeah i've had it yeah it's not faith
right it's truth right right it is right
it's just that everyone has experienced
that it's just that they believe well
around the core those were just bad apps
right exactly and around the corner is
the one
and what they fail to see is that they
see
humans as being different
and they're not humans are all the same
they're incredibly flawed
and there's
and once once again
that's why it's very difficult to listen
to these things unless you're looking
through the lens of truth because if you
look through good and bad you're you're
just an outraged individual you'll never
get anywhere it i'm not saying anything
bad about anyone
it's not bad
it's just the way it is
you know
dirt is dirty that's not bad
you know
let me just ask a couple more things and
we'll wrap this one up we talk about you
talk a lot you talk a lot about arrival
right we ditched the journey a long time
ago two years ago when we started this
thing you talk a lot about arrival so
knowing that how do you think about the
future as part of that arrival do you do
you think about the next two three four
ten years of your life in that manner or
d
every day is just you're just in the
present
well that in the present it's really
prescriptive
um it's it
no no i don't view a rival as this
chronological thing
um it's a it's a qualitative
uh
arrival now at something yeah like the
impatience
yeah it isn't if i do this for x number
of years
yeah that's not
that's that's empty
so you don't think about the future you
don't ever no no no no no
the only the future really is just
is death
that's the future
that's everyone's future
there's no nostradamus right there
right
that's your future
so the only feature that you're talking
about is you're talking about like
future for x number of years which
really isn't that yeah that's future
compared to now
but that isn't your future right people
talk about future as if it's like their
permanent future right
the permanent future is death
that's where everyone's headed
yeah but there's a lot of avoidance and
even having that conversation you know
very few people i mean there you go
again with the point one percent you
know how many people do you want do you
have a conversation with they want to
talk about that it's the ultimate
reality well you can't talk to anyone
about anything
human beings are people that you talk to
they're not ready to talk about anything
except for
you know what they did last night
right or how good that restaurant is or
how this
stupid wine tastes i mean it just
it's not even worth oxygen
that's nonsense right
i mean
the the bulk of humanity
is filler
it's an insult to waste humanity upon
them
i mean just
think about it
you go to these social events you talk
nonsense to nonsense people
you drink alcoholic substances
to numb your mind
so you don't even can't even see
straight you slur your speech
then you go to some stupid job and talk
about
gossip over the water cooler right
then you go and talk about you know well
you made this and this investment and
someone else only someone else made this
it's
it's beneath
insect behavior
that is not
that to say that a human being is the
most evolved creature yeah perhaps by
way of potential
but not by way of reality
just look look all over social media
right look in the newspapers look at
just look at
look at everything
human beings are not evolved creatures
they
the creation that he that the creation
that created them is evolved
but not them
everyone's just an idiot
living in adjacent skin right
it's
it with the potential to become grand
but
complete sellouts
to that which created them just a slap
in the face of nature
it's disgusting
you can't talk to anybody
they're either full of outraged
or or
just yap their mouth as soon as you say
anything don't even want to hear
anything they got these preconceived
notions about everything
you know they wave party flags they
uh these are not
evolved creatures
a slug is more evolved
oh you you you laugh but you you laugh
but because you're you you're telling me
the truth i get it man i get it i really
do get it and that's that's why i
appreciate you so much because i don't i
don't ever have these types of
conversations with anyone else is that
why
as human beings we're just always
judging other people all the time you
know
well judging others is just one little
detail in the
in the ant hood
um
it
a human doesn't really want
to get anywhere
he just wants to accumulate
he just wants to self adorn
a human doesn't want really want truth
he doesn't
he doesn't want
to arrive
at
um the glory
of what he was made to be
he wishes to
um
slide in the filth and the froth
that is his life
that is his mind
he spends his life in nightclubs and
bars and social events
and meetings i mean in meetings and
nature and schools and all these places
nature nature
looks at that and it says i wasted my
resources on that
yeah you wouldn't be caught dead
speaking at a conference right
well
i have no idea what i would do or not do
um
but like i would not say that i would do
this and i wouldn't do that
but i'd have to kidnap you but but
um
i i don't really do anything for like
like people
right i mean
so
i might do anything that would seem out
of character
but it would be done from an internal
place because there was some exploration
happening um that you know was
satisfying on the inside
not because i was trying to
you know do something on the outside you
know
you know
in any kind of
you know showmanship or or to reach
someone
or anything like that or anything ego
based
yeah have you met anyone in your life
who's reached the level of truth
that you are well i've it's i don't
you see it's not about accomplishment mo
um
it's about the sincerity of the desire
so i would say that perhaps a more
relevant uh and truthful question would
be
not have you met someone else who has
reached that but have you met someone
else who wanted that to that level
that's the real question because when
you because when no
but that doesn't mean that they don't
exist
um but
but because when you say have you met
someone who reached that
it implies that that can't be reached
and
um
i think that's that's not a truthful
message and i'm sure
i'm 100 certain there are people
somewhere in the world who are
wait way quote beyond whatever your
you know hierarchy is um beyond what
i've what i've done there's no reason to
look at me in any kind of
shining light or anything
would you like to work with somebody
like michael jordan
um i've never met michael
um it's not too far from you
yeah
um
[Music]
no it really isn't about what i would
like to work with someone if he wanted
to you know what i mean
it really is about the communion
it really is about
um me being inspired by
the
um
the
inspiration of the individual as to
where he or she wants to go or how what
their dna is or how deeply they really
want to go into something
um and how deeply they want to arrive
and how you know it's being it's really
being taken by that as opposed to
i would like to work with x no i you
don't have any you know i don't there's
no one in the world that i would like to
work with no one and just just real
quick because i said i'd wrap up 10
minutes ago but if somebody came to you
how do you determine whether or not
somebody came to you that has a level of
sincerity a level of seriousness
certainly maybe not up to that jordan
level or tiger level how do you
determine whether or not
you'll you'll
agree to work with somebody like that
well you feel it you'll feel it you feel
you'll feel the inspiration you'll feel
the communion you feel the
the connection
of
