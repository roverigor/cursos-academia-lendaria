## Cross-Prompt Consistency Analysis

### Voice Consistency: ✅ EXCELLENT

**Test:** Do all three prompts sound like Sam?

**Result:** YES - Strong consistency across all three prompts

**Evidence:**
- Signature phrases appear in all prompts naturally
- "Days are long but decades are short" used appropriately in crisis contexts
- "Compounding" language pervasive
- "Truth-seeking" vs "self-delusion" dichotomy maintained
- Direct, practical tone consistent

**Differences (Appropriate):**
- Generalista: Broadest scope, all 8 layers

**Generalista:**
- Use case: General conversation, philosophy, life advice
- Depth: All 8 layers integrated
- Breadth: Covers everything

**AGI Strategist:**
- Use case: AGI development, safety, timelines, governance
- Depth: Layers 6 (Obsessions), 3 (Frameworks), 8 (Integration)
- Focus: Mission-driven, technical AGI strategy

**Startup Advisor:**
- Use case: Founder mentoring, startup strategy, YC-style advice
- Depth: Layers 3 (Frameworks), 5 (Decision Playbooks), 7 (Algorithm)

## Token Budget Analysis

| Prompt | Tokens | % of Budget | Headroom | Status |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Generalista | 7,843 | 98.0% | 157 | ⚠️ Tight |
| AGI Strategist | 7,892 | 98.7% | 108 | ⚠️ Tight |
| Startup Advisor | 7,968 | 99.6% | 32 | ⚠️ Very Tight |

**Assessment:**
- All prompts at 98%+ utilization (excellent value)
- Minimal headroom for expansion
- Any updates will require careful editing

**Recommendation:** Current token allocation is optimal. Future versions may need to trim lower-confidence content to maintain budget.

## Real-World Test Scenarios (Recommended)

### Scenario 1: Long-Term Career Decision
**Query:** "Should I leave my stable job to start an AI company?"

**Expected Generalista Response:**
- Temporal zoom: "Will this matter in 10 years?"
- Exponential check: "Is this linear or exponential opportunity?"
- Truth-seeking: "Are you self-believing or self-deluding?"
- Signature: "Days are long but decades are short"

**Expected Startup Advisor Response:**
- Principle #5: "Make it easy to take risks"
- Exponential vs linear assessment
- Internal drive probe: "Are you internally driven?"
- Direct advice: Clear yes/no with reasoning

**Validation:** Both should give consistent advice through different lenses

---

### Scenario 2: AGI Timeline Question
**Query:** "When will we have AGI?"

**Expected AGI Strategist Response:**
- Epistemic humility: "I have uncertainty about specifics"
- Exponential progress: "Deep learning got predictably better with scale"
- Timeline: "End of this decade, possibly sooner"
- Stakes: "Possible superintelligence in a few thousand days"

**Expected Generalista Response:**
- Similar content but broader context
- Links to other implications (economic, societal)
- Less technical depth

**Validation:** AGI Strategist should be MORE detailed and technical

---

### Scenario 3: Hiring Decision
**Query:** "Should I hire this person with 10 years experience but plateau?"

**Expected Startup Advisor Response:**
- Framework: "Slope > Y-intercept for most roles"
- Red flag: "Plateau = declining slope"
- Question: "What's their rate of improvement?"
- Decision: Likely PASS unless force-of-nature

**Expected Generalista Response:**
- Same framework, less detailed application
- Broader context about team building

**Validation:** Startup Advisor should be MORE practical and decisive

---

## Known Limitations (Documented)

### Limitation 1: Temporal Coverage
**Issue:** Sources primarily 2015-2024; no post-2024 updates

**Mitigation:** Prompts acknowledge knowledge cutoff appropriately

**Impact:** LOW - Sam's core patterns are stable over this period

---

### Limitation 2: Private Decision-Making
**Issue:** Limited visibility into internal OpenAI deliberations

**Mitigation:** Prompts focus on publicly documented patterns and principles

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Some strategic nuance may be missing

---

### Limitation 3: Personal Life
**Issue:** Minimal personal life information in sources

**Mitigation:** Prompts redirect personal questions appropriately

**Impact:** LOW - Not relevant for primary use cases

---

### Limitation 4: Technical Implementation Details
**Issue:** Sam focuses on high-level strategy, not implementation

**Mitigation:** Prompts acknowledge this and redirect technical details appropriately

**Impact:** LOW - Consistent with Sam's actual expertise
