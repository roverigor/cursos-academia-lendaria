# NOTES & OBSERVATIONS
# =============================================================================

notes:

  research_specialist_notes: |
    Excellent source availability for Sam Altman. Three distinct temporal eras well-documented:
    1. Founder Era (2005-2012): Fair coverage, low priority (early Loopt days)
    2. YC President Era (2014-2019): Excellent coverage via CS183B, blog, Startup Playbook
    3. OpenAI CEO Era (2019-2025): Excellent coverage via podcasts, essays, testimony

    Key strengths:
    - Two comprehensive Lex Fridman interviews provide high-quality baseline
    - Stanford CS183B is richest single source (16 hours)
    - Congressional testimony provides high-stakes, authenticated voice
    - Blog archive (52+ posts) shows temporal evolution
    - Board crisis (Nov 2023) well-documented from multiple angles

    Key challenges:
    - Layer 8 paradox (optimistic+cautious on AI) requires careful synthesis
    - Personal life sparse (but acceptable for professional mind)
    - Early career (Loopt) thin (but low priority)

    Layer 8 Synthesis:
    The central intellectual challenge is capturing Sam's "both/and" thinking on AI:
    - Optimistic about AGI potential AND cautious about existential risk
    - Pro-innovation AND pro-regulation
    - Fast development AND safety-first
    This is not inconsistency - it's sophisticated contextual synthesis.

  special_considerations: |
    1. Board Crisis Context: November 2023 firing+rehiring is major event but should not
       define the mind. It's context, not essence. Weight appropriately (10% max).

    2. Elon Musk Relationship: Complex co-founder turned critic dynamic. Important context
       but avoid over-indexing on conflict narrative.

    3. Three Sams Framework: The mind must switch between Founder, YC President, and
       OpenAI CEO personas based on context. Temporal tagging is critical.

    4. Generic Tech Voice Risk: Sam shares optimization with Naval Ravikant, PG, Marc
       Andreessen. Validate distinctiveness through:
       - AI safety nuance (more cautious than Marc)
       - UBI advocacy (distinct from most VCs)
       - Energy/infrastructure obsession (beyond pure software)
       - Direct, prescriptive style (vs Naval's philosophical)

  recommended_priorities: |
    Week 1 (25 hours):
    - Start with Tier 1 core: Essays + Lex + Congressional
    - Establish baseline for Three Eras + Layer 8 paradox
    - Validate: Can we explain Sam's worldview after 25 hours?

    Week 2 (30 hours):
    - Add Tier 2 depth: Tim Ferriss, All-In, blog archive
    - Capture communication style and decision frameworks
    - Validate: Can we replicate Sam's voice and choices?

    Week 3 (15 hours):
    - Select Tier 3 validation: New Yorker, Worldcoin, policy
    - Triangulate patterns, fill Layer 1 gaps
    - Validate: Can we handle edge cases confidently?

    Target: 94% fidelity with 70 hours (Tier 1 + Tier 2 + selected Tier 3)

  brownfield_update_strategy: |
    Sam is highly active (2024-2025). Plan for incremental updates:

    Quarterly review (every 3 months):
    - New blog posts (expect 2-4 per quarter)
    - Major podcast appearances (Lex, All-In, major tech shows)
    - Policy testimony/statements
    - OpenAI product launches (Sam's announcements)

    Annual major update:
    - Re-process Tier 1 sources for evolution
    - Add significant new interviews (2+ hours)
    - Validate Layer 8 paradox still holds
    - Check for major worldview shifts (e.g., AGI timeline changes)

    Trigger for immediate update:
    - Major life/career transition (e.g., leaves OpenAI)
    - Significant public controversy or crisis
    - Major policy position change
    - Book publication (if ever)

    Monitoring sources:
    - blog.samaltman.com RSS feed
    - @sama Twitter notifications
    - OpenAI blog (co-authored posts)
    - Congressional testimony tracker

    Update effort estimate: 5-10 hours per quarter, 20-30 hours annually
