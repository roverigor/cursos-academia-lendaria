    - ICP: 100/100 (perfect match)
    - Unique combination: OpenAI CEO + Y Combinator background
    - High temporal relevance: AI boom timing

  time_investment_days: 3-5
  potential_annual_value_usd: 50000-100000

strategic_rationale:
  strengths:

    - Perfect ICP match (AI startup founders)
    - Unique value proposition (only OpenAI CEO + YC combo)
    - High temporal relevance (AI revolution timing)
    - Clear monetization path (premium tier justified)

  risks:
    - OpenAI information may be sensitive/confidential (mitigate: public sources only)
    - Rapidly evolving field (mitigate: brownfield updates)
    - High profile may attract scrutiny (mitigate: quality + transparency)

  opportunities:
    - First-mover advantage in AI advisor space
    - OpenAI playbook insights = competitive moat
    - Y Combinator network alignment
    - Enterprise licensing potential (accelerators)

next_steps:
  immediate:
    - Proceed to Research Phase
    - Source discovery (prioritize OpenAI-era content + YC essays)
    - Generate PRD using prd_template.md
    - Initialize TODO.md with 6-phase pipeline

  research_priorities:
    - Congressional testimonies (AI safety insights)
    - Recent podcasts (2023-2025 for OpenAI perspective)
    - Y Combinator essays (startup philosophy)
    - Twitter threads (real-time thinking on AI)

  layer_8_hypothesis:
    paradox: "AI Safety Advocate vs AI Acceleration Leader"
    description: "Sam pushes OpenAI forward rapidly while simultaneously advocating for AI regulation and safety - this productive paradox is his cognitive signature"
    evidence_needed: 3+ independent sources documenting this tension
