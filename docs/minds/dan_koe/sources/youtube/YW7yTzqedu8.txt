people don't believe me when I tell them
I work less than four hours a day
especially at this point in my life
where I'm working about one to two hours
a day and now I want to make very clear
here that like nothing is permanent
right just the principle of impermanence
where even the people that work 12 to 14
hours a day don't always work 12 to 14
hours a day every single day 365 for the
rest of their life it varies and so I'm
setting the scene here where I don't
work less than four hours every single
day sometimes it's four sometimes it's
six sometimes it's eight sometimes it's
ten sometimes it's more sometimes it's
less sometimes it's one sometimes it's
zero okay so setting the scene there but
the point here is the majority of my
time I would say 90 of my days when I am
not focused on a project or have
procrastinated to the point of having to
work 10 hours a day I work one to two
hours a day right now and for ninety
percent of my days I work less than four
hours a day there's a lot of meaning
behind this if you are new to this whole
four hour work day thing that I promote
go and watched the video the four hour
work day that will give you so much more
context when you come into this video so
how do I work only four hours a day
first is that I've always focused on
eliminating the things that I don't like
in my life I didn't like client work or
hosting podcasts when I took those
things on because it was the smart thing
to do at that point in my business right
now this is assuming that you are a
creative entrepreneur a Creator a
freelancer an agency owner or a
one-person business or just have a small
team because client work and getting on
calls all the time and hosting podcasts
and having that in my day that added two
to three hours of work to my day every
single day and I just noticed the
futility in them very quick they didn't
make sense to do when I knew that I
could just I could create something
different provide the same exact amount
of value and make more money because it
didn't demand that much time for me and
as the same thing with like getting
locked into a religious Paradigm or a
nutrition Paradigm like the carnivore
diet the same thing happens for getting
getting locked in a business Paradigm
like freelancing and client working
thinking that you can't pivot and change
what you do on a daily basis simply
because that's what you're supposed to
do that's what you were taught and you
didn't seek to question or actually
create a new way of business for
yourself nobody knows what they're doing
people are just giving away methods here
and there so that you can try them adopt
them see if they work for you but at the
end of the day the Fulfillment comes
from building your own way of doing it
by creating a lifestyle that is of your
own design by actually being creative
and that is the problem that we're going
to dive into about how hustle culture
and working 12 to 14 hours a day and
being in that consistent state of stress
stress being the antagonist to
open-mindedness so when you're
close-minded the entire time and you
don't have the ability to even zoom out
and have any form of creativity then how
are you going to change your work so
that you can work less and make more so
the second thing is that I've always
focused on the highest leverage
activities possible so freelance and
Consulting and agency work that's a
great starting point for most beginners
it has to be done in many cases not all
it's a good way to start making money
first you can of course put that off
build an audience and then fuel products
or Services over time and kind of delay
when you actually start making money but
at the end of the day you need a product
that is able to sell and maintain itself
while you sleep if you actually want to
be able to do this without hiring an
immense amount of employees which I
don't want to do the time to money ratio
has to decrease as you grow or get
better at business and so I realized
very quickly that client work manual
Outreach all this stuff was just taking
up so much time and I was so closed off
to the thought of being a Creator or
building a personal brand or actually
building leverage along the way not just
shooting blanks of thousands upon
thousands of cold emails and having no
leverage or readership built to show for
it and so I realized that writing is the
foundation of all of that writing goes
into my tweets those get repurposed to
every single platform Instagram reels
YouTube shorts whatever newsletter gets
repurposed into YouTube videos and so
all of this is just based around writing
so I know that with the momentum that
I've built I can write for one to two
hours every single morning just on my
content which is traffic generation to
fuel the products that sell when I sleep
that's literally all I have to do and if
I want to push further by say writing a
book and distributing that or building a
software like I am then that's going to
add a bit more time to the amount of
time that I spend working but it's still
manageable because I'm still focusing on
the levers and not letting all of these
unnecessary time suckers take my time
and attention and so this is where most
people fail right is they take courses
which are extremely valuable because
schools don't teach them and knowledge
not found in schools equals money not
found in employment so people take
courses or they read online Internet
content and they completely Miss what
the actual lever moving tasks are even
though they are made very clear people
go through the course and then just
forget all of it and try to go about
what they were going to do anyways by
not listening to anything in the course
they use that as motivation to act and
then they wonder why they're not getting
results people will come to me and
they'll say Dan I'm not getting results
on this anymore and then I ask okay what
are you doing every single day at any
given moment of your day like that first
morning block when you're actually
working on building your business what
are the exact steps that you were taking
and then they either list out one thing
or they aren't able to list out anything
tangible that they're actually doing to
grow they're procrastinating for three
hours while working on things that don't
 matter for the other eight so
the third thing is that people still
don't realize the compounding nature of
readership growth business online and
offline requires people and a product or
traffic and an offer and P people come
from ads or geographic location like
having a physical small business manual
Outreach like cold calls or cold emails
or creating content to grow a readership
in the new Digital Society or Creator
economy so most businesses are still
locked in the old Paradigm that they
have to just consistently focus on
getting customers every single day they
neglect or completely glance over the
thought and power of social media as a
necessary part of life and as the
foundation of modern business every
business has to be and will be demanded
to be on social media so I wrote this
tweet this is my Creator philosophy go
large and Broad so you can talk about
whatever you want your newsletter
products and services create beginner to
Advanced Niche sub audiences a map that
guides people through the hierarchy of
needs as you self-actualize I've always
been a fan of growing as large as I can
on top of funnel socials like Twitter
and whatever and then other things
because everyone's like Niche down Niche
down be super specific so you can sell a
product or service it's not like your
newsletter products and services and
Lead magnets that all lead into each
other are your Niche audiences that you
are building your top of funnel should
be Broad and large so that you can
actually be you which is the most
profitable Niche and so my point is this
if a brand with 50 000 followers can
make fifty thousand dollars a month yes
this is the low end if you know what
you're doing I can make that much with
one tenth of the effort if I have 500
000 followers now imagine if I have 2
million which I do I can make that much
in an hour a week in other words I can
make 10 times the amount as other people
because of the focus that I've invested
over the years and I don't care to work
longer for the sake of playing the
status game that every single other
entrepreneur is playing of oh who can
work longer hours oh hustle grind this
oh I work so long I deserve more than
you me writing one tweet is the same as
a beginner writing ten thousand simply
because I've iterated so many times and
have had I understand what a high
performing idea is I have so much more
knowledge and experience that goes into
one tweet versus a beginner who has to
build that up so here's a tweet from tej
Dosa I highly recommend following him on
Twitter I know an entrepreneur who works
14 hours a day and is stuck living in
the basement I know an entrepreneur who
works five hours a day and is built and
sold three companies for 100 million
dollars plus each the value isn't in how
many hours you work but where you focus
your attention awareness and
Consciousness that last part is so so so
crucial and another caveat that has to
be made here is that you have to
understand that most people right the
people that like challenge me working
four hours a day are usually the kids
who don't know what they're doing or are
just getting started and are have been
brainwashed by this business ideology
that come in and since they have so much
time on their hands they think they have
to fill it with work when they don't
realize that most people that are
actually going to see some success are
going to be forced to focus on the
levers in the high value activities it's
going to people be people at the nine to
five job that have the pressure to get
out because they hate that situation and
they're going to have to dedicate one
hour one hour that's it every single
morning two actually making the business
work and they're gonna make it work
faster than the little kid who is
working 14 hour days simply because they
just procrastinate the entire time and
think they're making progress when
they're not and so what's that if nine
to five people can build a side income
with one hour a day and scale that up as
they build leverage as they build an
audience because that compounds what is
so crazy about working one hour a day
there's nothing crazy about it it's
crazy to work longer than that most
people aren't increasing their skill
level they are increasing the amount of
time that they spend at their current
skill level for absolutely no reason and
so Shameless plug I share all of this in
my digital economics masterclass for
productizing yourself or turning
yourself into the business there's the
four hour workday philosophy and there's
the leverage that you have to focus on
because people just don't understand
what to do and no you don't need to buy
a course that's not what I'm getting at
here I'm just saying if you want all of
the systems that I use and the things
that are valuable enough to put into a
course which I talk about here and there
of course but if you want to invest in
some form of Education that is 1 40th
the cost of a college degree that can
make you 10 times more go ahead and
check it out so now why do I only work
four hours a day because there's a
glaring problem with the overworkers 14
hour a day lifestyle overwork is the
antagonist of holistic development and
holism is the Catalyst to exponential
growth towards self-transcendence people
wonder why I work three to four hours a
day on average and I wonder why they
don't if they value self-actualization
and actually making it to the next level
of their life for me to illustrate this
think of a talent tree or skill tree in
a video game so here's a graphic where
you have Mind Body Spirit and business
and you have levels going up the left
side and now you have to understand that
it's not just linear Development Across
all of these domains of life they're
interconnected it's a web of problems
that are dependent on each other to be
solved so in order to get to let's say
level four of business then you're going
to have to get to level four plus of
Mind Body or Spirit or if you want to
reach true self-actualization and the
spiritual people that think business
isn't a necessary way to reach that
point are going to fail right and
they're not going to realize it because
they're neglecting the development of a
huge domain of their life which is
financial development and the
development of their life's work which
is the vessel for creation creation Your
Divine gift and business is the vessel
for contributing to humanity which is
something greater than you that is
bridged by Spirit it is fulfillment and
so the whole there's like common advice
to focus on one thing and it's good
advice but that it completely ignores
the fact that in order to focus on one
thing you have to focus on the things
the multitude of things that allow you
to focus on that one thing like if you
can't start a business yet because you
don't have the time or you don't have
the money or you don't have whatever
then what is the problem standing in the
way that you have to bring your focus on
so you can bring your focus back to that
main thing that you want so now that we
have that base we need to talk about the
psychology and futility of nine to five
jobs so let's open this can of worms by
making a hard distinction between work
and rest we will classify work as
productivity mode and rest as creativity
mode so here's another graphic that I've
created before on the focus Matrix so
there are four corners of focus that you
can be kind of tapped into at any given
time these are states of Mind these
aren't permanent they all kind of mix
into each other but you can kind of get
the point of what I'm saying here where
there's unconscious narrow Focus there's
unconscious open Focus there's conscious
narrow focus and there's conscious open
focus and so with productivity mode this
is a state of narrow focused attention
you are fixated on solving a problem
that a specific task presents and it's
almost always accompanied by a specific
pressure or stress to perform form right
like the I feel like this is human
nature and more people need to accept it
that we move better when we have
pressure and that procrastination is
kind of a good thing but mindful
procrastination where you shouldn't
really care about your work until it's
coming closer to that actual time where
then you're consciously and narrowly
focused on the task at hand and you
knock it out in a 10 times better
fashion than if you were to spread that
work out at least that's how it's always
worked for me and the people that I've
talked to and so another thing is that
you like this state isn't necessarily
bad right being stressed and all this
stuff isn't bad it's a mode of being and
you have to contrast the two you have to
balance out the creativity and
productivity and so in Psychology the
productivity mode is best illustrated by
the task positive Network in the brain
that is active during a tension
demanding task and includes our
conscious attention toward the external
environment so creativity mode is an
open focused state of attention you do
not fixate on a stress-related task but
you can still be focused on a task or
goal but you're not really actively
paying attention into it you're not
thinking about work and so you can note
this phenomenon when you are like at the
gym or in the shower or going on a hike
or going on a walk or any other form of
rest I'm not talking about sitting
around drinking wine and shoveling ice
cream down your throat I'm talking about
actual rest not laziness so in
Psychology this state is best
illustrated by the default mode Network
that activates when we shift from
outward to inward focused cognition and
a beautiful thing here is that the
default mode Network so when you are not
working your brain is more active do you
know what that means that means that you
are going to solve more problems have
more ideas have more insights to
actually channel into your work when you
take more rest so the problem is that
overworkers don't realize that habits
are not only what you do but who you are
so a state of mind like productivity
mode can be conditioned into your mind
you can be brainwashed into working 14
hours a day and you can live in that
narrow state of stress and away and for
too long to the point where it starts to
wreak havoc on your health which is
going to even further decrease the
effects or impact of your business and
that's just the thing is that you don't
care why because you don't know you
don't realize it because it's a slow
drag into this lower state of being that
you just see as normal because the
change isn't immediate and your current
level of awareness or Consciousness
doesn't allow you to grasp at the higher
rung of the latter because it's clouded
by fog your life is so mechanical and
known that it never crosses your mind
that there is an unknown that can
benefit you your identity feels
threatened at the thought that you could
be making more progress by working three
to four hours a day and you're afraid of
the unknown lifestyle that you could be
thrown into right you're it's natural
for you to be working 12 to 14 hours
right now and if you were to just
drastically shift to three to four hours
a day you would hate it and I don't
blame you that's just human nature
that's how all change is in your life so
in this case the ego o constricts its
grips on your way of living and you keep
doing what you have always been doing so
I'm not saying that productivity mode is
bad it's actually one of the most
enjoyable States you can be in right the
Flow State but of course Flow State also
transfers into open state of focus like
being in nature having some form of
challenge etc etc but it's it's so
enjoyable because it's so secure certain
and focused so that negative thoughts
don't replicate in your mind and most
hard-working entrepreneurs would scoff
at the fact that they are the exact same
as a nine-to-five worker but they are
and the best way to explain this is with
the skill challenge match which I
learned from mihai chick sent me high so
you can see here there's a challenge
level going up the left skill level uh
across the bottom there's anxiety and
boredom on either side of the flow
Channel and when your skill level
matches the challenge level of any given
situation that is when you are in flow
but what people don't realize is that
this has to continue evolving right
eventually a challenge becomes normal to
you so that it's easy and then you get
bored with it or if you aim too high and
your skill doesn't match then you get
anxious and so these things have to
continue evolving and both working 12 to
14 hours a day as an entrepreneur or
working the same mechanical nine-to-five
job every single day it prevents your
personal Evolution and it is dangerous
for your psyche there is no higher
Ladder rung you may be making more
progress in business and taking in the
money but what about the things that
actually matter in life that that money
contributes to and if you have an a
reaction to that of like oh the like
money doesn't matter I'm not saying that
money doesn't matter I'm saying that it
matters a lot I'm saying there are other
things in your life that actually need
cultivation and appreciation and
attention and so I talk about that
phenomenon in the video the life is a
video game but challenge Narrows the
mind on a problem that is standing in
the way of a goal which is the driver of
evolution we all feel the pull towards
something greater than ourselves right
and then as we are pulled towards that
and our desire to reach that higher
state of existence happens we meet
problems that must be solved and if we
are ignoring problems aside from just
the money problems because we're working
12 to 14 hours a day then we're not
going to be able to reach that point
we're not going to fulfill our purpose
of being on this Earth and so as I said
all of this has to evolve your the
challenges you take on in life have to
evolve your skill has to continue
increasing to match stagnation equals
Death and in order to reach new levels
of challenge to focus your attention you
must never stop learning to stack new
skills and perspectives increase the
complexity of your character to be able
to even perceive the challenge solve
deeper problems in your life so you
don't get trapped in The Superficial
this is my gripe with most nine to five
they inevitably come with a cap on both
your income and your development I see
nine to five jobs as a stepping stone
they breed complacency and are dangerous
for your psyche challenge is what makes
life fun and interesting if you halt
your personal evolution by never
pursuing something more you lose purpose
and fulfillment now of course most
people have their own goals and people
can achieve a sustained level of
happiness at a nine to five job but I am
not speaking to those people right I'm
supposed to be a Creator I'm supposed to
be myself I'm supposed to get across my
beliefs I'm supposed to have some form
of a niche audience you're supposed to
disagree with me on some things and this
may be one of them but again I'm not
speaking to those people I'm speaking to
you or else you wouldn't be watching
this you wouldn't even be curious about
this you wouldn't have that desire for
more if the work doesn't require
creativity delegate it automate it or
leave it that's a classic quote from
Naval creativity is the balance to
productivity because a constant need to
be productive leads to a constant state
of stress and stress just closes your
mind off and clouds your actual critical
critical thinking skills and leads to
you living in overly superficial life
and this impacts every other area of
your life like your relationship with
your friends and loved ones your ability
to recover from health related
activities your mental capacity and
development which dictates your future
level of true wealth four hour work days
singular focus and meaningful work is
becoming the norm on small pockets of
the internet and I wouldn't have it any
other way ancient Romans and Greeks
Steve Jobs Charles Darwin and an
ever-growing list of visionary
strategists and innovators attribute
their success to surprisingly low work
times accompanied by an abundance of
restful activities like long walks when
we see someone with a respectable body
of creative work we assume that they
just work long hours and that they
obsess into the night over the details
of their next piece and they may but
obsessing and thinking and contemplating
that's not work that's rest that's the
default mode Network going off and you
having inward focused cognition to
actually bring better more impactful
ideas to your focused output and so when
we look at reality we see the opposite
like Charles Darwin arriving at his
study at eight o'clock after his morning
walk and breakfast he would work for an
hour and a half take a break to read the
mail and write letters then return to
more serious work where he conducted his
experiments by noon Darwin would stop
his work day and head out on long walk
after reading and answering a few more
letters he would take a nap take another
walk and return to his study for another
work block three to five hours of
focused work paired with active rest
seems to be the sweet spot for most
impactful creatives and so if they can
change culture and business in society
at large why can't corporate Workaholics
do the same they can it's impossible and
so if you're wondering how to do this or
how to do Focus work I've talked about
this before in both the four hour
workday video and it's called like how
to change your life in six months my
deep work routine both are good videos
but now we need to talk about the new
currency like why is creativity so
important creativity and leverage are
obviously very important here but why
because first how do you make money
first you need attention and second you
need a product or service to direct that
attention and third you need to
understand the process of guiding
attention throughout that Journey from
your brand to your newsletter to your
lead magnet to your product to other
social media platforms inside of a long
form let's say YouTube video how are you
going to hold attention it all comes
from a ideas and so if you aren't
creative and you don't have ideas then
everything about your brand suffers and
you are going to automatically go and
learn direct response marketing so you
have all of these Frameworks Frameworks
and templates for manipulating people's
attention and holding it with something
that isn't by your own design it's not
creative it doesn't help further the
understanding in the niche that you were
trying to advance understanding in it
becomes so shallow so fast I've been in
that position and so my funnel is simple
I write a big idea Centric newsletter
every week I write three Punchy and
memorable tweets every day I repurpose
them to all platforms my new my
newsletters my YouTube script I teach
you how I write my newsletters in my
course to our writer which is very like
idea generation Centric and talks about
productivity and creativity mode in a
more practical fashion you must capture
hold and nurture their attention with
ideas ideas are the new currency modern
success is mental Warfare creativity
rest and short work hours are or the
Catalyst this is something that I
realized late in my journey is that if
you don't prioritize depth you won't be
remembered because think about it I was
on a podcast with Matt Gray
um not sure when that's going to be
released but maybe you can find it after
this video is that I made the
realization that my tweets maybe hold
five seconds worth of attention right
and so if I write tweets over time
that's just a bunch of like scattered
attention it's not held for a long
amount of time but then when I read a
book like when I see an idea on Twitter
after holding that five seconds of
attention I see the tweet and then I
automatically relate it to a book that
I've already read and I attribute that
idea to that author right if I read
anything about spirituality it goes
straight to Eckhart Tolle because I read
the book and I invested six seven eight
hours of my attention into that book
right power in this modern world is
determined by how much attention you
hold over time and frankly the short
form tweets reels shorts Tech talks Etc
that's not going to do it that's not
going to build your Authority that's not
going to make you memorable and frankly
that's not going to make you meaningful
money it's going to make you superficial
shallow short-term money and so this is
why I'm so big on long-form newsletter
YouTube podcast book writing and fueling
that with the top of funnel socials that
are easier to grow on by writing short
form content and the other thing is that
like this yeah it's a difficult game
it's going to be difficult right
you the newsletter is going to take a
long time to write and actually get good
at the YouTube videos are going to take
even longer that's because you have to
increase your skill to match the
challenge of actually being an impactful
Creator if this is your life's work
which it is going to be for I believe 80
percent of the population over the
coming 50 years then what else is there
to do spend your time on it so let's end
this off on a practical note by going
over what we previously gone over but I
call it my fill mtus framework fill your
brain in the afternoons with books
learning and socialization empty your
brain before bed with journaling
planning and meditation use your brain
in the morning with creation output and
Folk that is the overly simplistic tweet
that I had at some point and it went
viral so I started creating more
lifestyle and productivity content but
let's break it down a bit more in the
afternoons fill your mind through
curiosity pursuit to collect kernels of
Truth to integrate into your worldview
skill acquisition to increase your value
in the marketplace that continues to
change if you stop learning you die
intellectual conversation so you don't
get trapped in a narrow perspective you
need to test your ideas with an open
mind avoid debate and argument all of
which can be used as the fuel for your
creative work in the evenings empty your
mind through self-reflection to note
mistakes lessons and directions that you
would have missed otherwise reality
mapping or documenting what you learn
for the day and how it connects to other
ideas so you can create something of
value spiritual connection so you don't
get trapped in doing mode Embrace being
to balance out the stress in the morning
use your mind through focused work to
channel your discoveries and practice
your craft priority projects to have
direction for your work this is the only
way to produce something that you can
pass off to other people and get paid
for doing so and bursts of intensity so
you feel a sense of accomplishment first
thing in the morning you can be at ease
during your rest knowing that you
knocked out what needs to be done ending
it here like subscribe courses in the
description other free guides like a
planner seven days to genius idea
Challenge and other things just check
out the description and yeah enjoy the
rest of your day see you
