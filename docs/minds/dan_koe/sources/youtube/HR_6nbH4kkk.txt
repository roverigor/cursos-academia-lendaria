complex sales funnels upsells with
countdown timers absurd guarantees and
flexing big numbers rented Lamborghinis
and beautiful women on a yacht for a
paid photo shoot to market the product
that was the state of internet marketing
10 years ago and you still see some of
it now and I don't believe it's all bad
most of the things that I talk about in
my videos I don't actually believe are
all bad I'm just using them to help
frame a discussion like I am here but
over the past 10 years it seems like
most of the big names or the things that
we are exposed to on the internet people
are people seem like they're walking on
eggshells and bending the truth to make
an income start an agency you can make a
hundred thousand dollars fast so you can
learn one skill that you hate to work
with people that you hate start a Drop
Shipping Store you can ship straight
from China so you can sell useless
products and contribute to the cheap
dopamine Extravaganza going on online
Target this Niche and never break out of
it never evolve never incorporate your
interest into your work always squeeze
the most money you can out of your
customers okay nobody actually said that
but it was implied in their teachings I
don't really care if you go out and do
these things I feel like they can be a
decent stepping stone and I made a tweet
the other day about how uh the most
successful people they use unethical
strategies and spin them in an ethical
way that is how you start to integrate
Your Shadow right it is much better than
repressing your emotions and having and
starting to unconsciously manipulate
people because everyone has a dark side
everyone has a shadow to think you are
absolutely pure is just idiotic and even
more egoic than you think because you're
thinking it's not egoic you need a a
modality or a vessel to integrate Your
Shadow and so sales marketing persuasion
influence and practicing these things in
business in order to sell a beneficial
product is a very useful thing to do
with your life so these things aren't
bad and there's a better way of going
about it and that's why you watch these
videos right you're subscribed to my
channel because you want to create a
better life and maybe you've experienced
these business models before and have
tried them out for three to six months
or however long it takes to start seeing
some results and you're just not content
with your results you're not sad with
your work you don't see it becoming
fulfilling to you and that's the entire
reason you got into this so if you've
watched my videos you know that I am
here to tell you that there is a way to
do what you want or do what you enjoy
and pull in an income doing so and this
entire video uh came about because I was
on a zoom call with a guy named Michael
in the modern Mastery Community one of
the members and we hit it off and we
were talking about the future of the
crater economy and we noticed some
patterns because he's deep in the
business game I'm deep in the business
game and we've noticed certain things in
the first two just kind of frame this
discussion is that the level of markets
sophistication across the board is
increasing as a whole and so Marcus
sophistication in this sense is the
awareness of the products and services
available on the market right so the
market right now is pretty dang flooded
with all of this shallow cheap advice
like how to get laid 101 how to pick up
girls how to start this agency business
whatever whatever all of these Quick Fix
products that neglect the big picture of
business right and without a big picture
without being able to see into the
future and have that sense of
fulfillment or sense of Mastery behind
what you're doing over a long enough
time period you're going to burn out and
you are not going to enjoy your life
when the entire reason you are doing
this is to enjoy your life more and so
with that raising of the level of Market
sophistication it's just like the school
system how most of us especially if
you're watching this video have lost
trust in the school system right but now
people are losing trust in and have not
had that much trust for the Shady
marketing tactics that have been
presented over the last decade of
internet marketing as a whole so to
start this off this is this week's
visual right so on this is the future of
Education in my eyes where a student
instead of going through the school
system which prefers Conformity
memorization standardized tests
convergent thinking and just becoming a
cog in the machine and then being
trained into the societal system or the
social fabric as an employee a student
will go through the Creator economy and
be able to pursue their Curiosities find
a community learn relevant skills that
you can actually make money with start a
real world Project without having or
needing any credentials there's no
Gatekeepers on the internet and then
acquiring the specific knowledge
necessary along the way to become an
entrepreneur and so
um a lot of You Know My Philosophy about
how everyone is an entrepreneur some
just decide to get paid for the value
they have to provide I also talk about
how entrepreneurship is modern day
survival our ancestors were
entrepreneurs and they served their
communities right in the past you had a
little niche community that in this case
it was like a physical Community rather
than in unlimited digital Community
where you had a specific thing that you
could provide inside of that physical
Community whether you were a cook or the
the naturopath right you helped people
heal or you were the doctor or you went
out and hunted for food you created
fires you were taking care of the kids
whatever it may be things have subtly
shifted right in terms of like tangible
things but our psyche Remains the Same
right and so we have to fulfill the same
needs through entrepreneurship and so my
first point with this to illustrate
communities is that uh reality is not
compartmentalized right when people go
to school they usually start somewhat
broad with like General Studies and then
they Niche down and into a specific
compartment right they go to for a
biology degree or a certain doctor
degree right they get very specific and
what that does is that neglects the
holistic nature of life and so the same
holds true for online business where
they tell you to Niche down as far as
 possible so you can like Target
a specific problem within that but like
building an audience and a personal
brand is somewhat new right more people
are talking about it now and to be quite
honest in my experience in the past
three years of me doing this previously
freelancing so I understand both sides
of the argument the strategies for
making an income are vastly different
right if you want to Niche down and stay
very focused on one little niche you are
limiting your audience growth and your
future potential to Pivot so an example
just to paint the picture zubi is
someone on Twitter and other platforms
now who's grown quite a bit where his
main topic that he talks about is like
political stuff self-improvement but he
sells
um a fitness program and he makes music
right you're just a personal brand
you're attracting people that like you
and then you are niching down on a
specific problem or goal that people
relate with and then you're positioning
a product to be perceived from the lens
of that problem or goal and then you are
selling it to the people that resonate
with that in your audience you're not
like not every single person in your
audience is a customer right away right
when they follow you and so with this
the essence of marketing is getting
people from point A to point B via a
transformation right and what's in the
middle there from point A to point B
Isn't So compartmentalized to something
like biology right in my case modern
Mastery the community I help people work
less earn more enjoy life I can create
like a better point B and illustrate
that point but it's to live a good life
right that is a niche goal most people
don't want that so some do and even less
want it from me as a teacher right
people resonate with me that's Niche
enough and so with that what is my
process from going to point A to point B
it's not limited to one thing like
building a business it's health wealth
relationships is everything that
it takes to create a good life and if
you limit yourself to one specific thing
then you are limiting the value that you
can give your audience right and this is
what I'm trying to paint with this
entire video so that was the first point
to start to frame this conversation the
second point is that we need more
Holistic Solutions for a community with
a shared purpose so Napoleon Hill has a
concept called a mastermind and in
essence what that is it is a group of
one or more people or two or more people
so a group of people with a shared
purpose and by working together they can
actualize that purpose 10 times faster
than they would be able to alone right
so you are building a community of
people with a same purpose that's what
you're attracting people to is your
vision or your purpose for the future
and then by combining Minds you are able
to help other people hit that much much
much faster your audience in this case
is your community that you are serving
and each of them in this Creator economy
are going to have their own Community as
well if they decide to lean into their
entrepreneurial nature and so what
you're doing is you're attracting this
community and then you're distilling
what you know your knowledge expertise
experience skill set to them in order to
reach the goals that you set for them
right you are becoming an educator and
so the purpose that you are helping
people achieve
is Venetian itself but the way you help
people achieve that goal is not Niche
down it's holistic right what is
everything it takes to reach that goal
is it starting a business is it
beginning self-improvement is it
nurturing your relationships right we'll
talk about this more so we need fewer
shallow promises and more solutions to
reach meaningful goals and that means
that the foundation of the information
you give out as a Creator needs to have
people set meaningful goals for
themselves it needs the foundation of
every single teaching needs to be
critical thinking but modern business
models don't do that right they pay no
regard to that Drop Shipping a fancy
little flashlight has no soul and then
creating like a basic journal with a
print-on-demand strategy just so you can
sell something like to get in on
whatever little game there is that's
fine go ahead and do that but you're
here because you want to do more right
you want to not be that person you
actually want to contribute to people's
lives and and so the same holds true for
starting an agency with a skill that you
don't give a about to sell to
people that you don't give a about
in order to pull in cash that is just
like there's no there's nothing there so
the third point is Clarity above all
because the past decade of internet
marketing has banked on complexity
products and services would have the
same Simple Solutions just repackaged in
a new way because that is marketing
right you go and look at any self-help
book on habits and they're all saying
the same thing but they're different in
the form of how they're told which is
actually a good thing I'm not blaming
books here because books are usually
more holistic than not because it
involves the author's personal
experience or you're tying in different
anecdotes but when it comes to courses
or even internet content in general is
just step step step step here's how you
do it and there's nothing unique about
this you just need to go and do it and
I'm gonna the next person is going to
repackage it into something else and
then everyone's gonna get stuck in this
surface level bubble and never seek out
the depth behind things or the root
cause right so now people want a clear
simple and practical solution from the
lens that they learn best from or from
the teacher that they learn best from
right so I am a very philosophical
person and people follow me because I'm
philosophical and some people are very
practical and they enjoy the the
practicality zero fluff stuff I love
fluff like the tweets or the social
media posts where it's like I only like
to read books that don't have fluff or
cut through the fluff and give me the
straight value and this is uh with me
specifically because like I just like
fluff it helps me frame certain things
it gives me the Nuance or the Big Ideas
that the the same old actionable advice
won't give right there's only so many
principles in all of this stuff like if
you want to go and learn how to start a
billion dollar company you can do that
in like 10 steps and then everything
else is really like there's steps to do
things and most people don't do that
because they don't have the fluff that
resonated with them they don't have the
why that made them actually go and act
on something right people are so stuck
in this little surface level trap of I
want I want to know exactly how to do
this this this this and this without the
the vision or the why or even the
clarity to get there because of that
path it's just
it's all out of whack and so as a
Creator by leaning into the voice that
you learn best from or using that to
help others or just following the people
that you learn best from the student
teacher relationship gets a lot better
there in the Creator economy because you
attract people with your shared goals
and the ones that learn best from you
and this starts to illustrate the depth
behind my saying you are the niche and I
have a video on this as well in the one
person business playlist so now we're
going to talk about the emergence and
demand for the holistic synthesizer so
under this philosophy that I'm painting
The Creator economy cannot get saturated
because one your community evolves so
when you don't subscribe to a specific
label compartment or niche of reality
that limits what you are capable of the
only option is to evolve beyond that
humans and communities or collectives do
not only stick to one goal right it
evolves with time you you achieve a goal
and then you set a new one and then you
you achieve it and you set a new one and
you achieve it and you set a new one and
so as a Creator you evolve and that
means that your products evolve right so
I started out as a web designer and I
sold a web design product because only
thing you can do is teach what you know
from personal experience and so my
products or Services revolved around web
design I sold a web design product I
freelance with web design I sold a
freelancing product as well and over
time as I created new products as those
didn't fulfill me as much and I wanted
more and I wanted to grow I stopped
selling those and I desaturated the
market so a new web designer can come in
right so if creators or this is just
creators in general if they actually
keep improving themselves and don't get
stagnant and continue building then your
products evolve and you desaturate the
market underneath you so the third Point
here is that you have a unique web of
Interest right it's a web of Interest as
an example I've talked about this many
times before go watch the other videos
but a person that is interested in
Fitness business and spirituality is
vastly different from a person that
talks about Fitness business and Tech
right just because of the infinite
combinations those hold and the the
topics that spring from those and how
you articulate those over 50 000 tweets
or 1 000 Instagram posts or even 1 000
YouTube videos and then the fourth point
of why the Creator economy cannot get
saturated is that large creators have
ample resources it's not rarer to see
large accounts decrease output on all
fronts I see this all the time uh on
Twitter like with people over 300 000
followers they tweet like once a day
maybe once every three days they have
resources they don't need more right
they have all the money they could have
and you this isn't rare on YouTube
either if you go and look at someone
with a million subscribers I'd say 50 of
the time they've either stopped posting
altogether or they're posting like once
a month once every three months or
something like that just to pop in and
say what's up and so this gives new
creators the ability to flood the market
generate attention for themselves and
show that they are an authority in the
space and then continue evolving of all
the evolving until they reach a point
where they also have ample resources
mostly in the form of money and then
they can go on to start another business
like right now I'm starting a software
business I'm also writing a book I'm
doing other high level activities so
that I can eventually move on I don't
ever want to leave social media per se
but I don't want it to it doesn't
consume my life but it did previously I
I want to
the entire goal behind my efforts is to
be in full control of my days and so
over 10 years of attempting to solve
that problem that's what you need to do
you need to evolve so the holistic
synthesizer which is the solution to
this all and what I would encourage you
to become or aim to become so let's
define what this holistic synthesizer is
it is someone who pursues their own
Vision forges their path with the unique
skills and interests they acquire they
do not view those skills or interests as
individual Parts but as an
interconnected whole that are necessary
aspects of their life not temporary
pieces for a quick cash grab their
life's work is to distill educate and
distribute their personal experience on
the path in short a holistic synthesizer
is someone who documents their Journey
to the good life in an educational and
persuasive manner that's what everyone's
trying to do right why not be honest
about it every single person's Niche is
how to achieve the good life I saw a
tweet somewhere this sounds apps this
sounds extremely cringe but it's so true
and I saw this like two years ago but it
was a tweet and it was like everyone's
at the end of everyone's Journey they
are a life coach okay so why not lean
into that now you don't have to label
yourself as a life coach be get creative
with it like call yourself the the
modern conqueror or something same thing
but that's what a brand is right don't
call yourself a life coach create
 good brand your brand is your
story where you are now regardless of
experience your content is your school
what helped you get there pass it down
your product is the map a holistic
system that helps people get to where
you are with less trial and error the
internet has given you the power to
self-educate faster than ever has been
possible to just educate yourself and
learn new skills take it upon yourself
to improve your life pursue your
Curiosities and share your discoveries
that's all this is when more people
Master their personal lives they can put
the creative ability of their minds
together to work on global Problems by
the point you do this you'll know what
to do by the point you master your
survival or improve yourself to the
point of self-actualization you'll know
what to do you have to build your own
thing entrepreneurship is modern day
survival your psyche is wired to hunt
you are neurobiologically rewarded for
hunting for your survival not for being
a monkey in a cubicle hunt for money to
ease survival-induced stress and open
room for creativity the Creator
philosophy is not a business model but a
way of life and in essence it's improve
yourself and then improve others that
want to be helped from the lens that you
were distilling in for information from
or from your personal experience so here
are the steps to doing this so you can
start acting today step number one is of
course to master your survival and this
is Mastery is a process right you don't
have to wait until you hit the point
where you've mastered your survival
because frankly I don't think you'll
ever like actually register as you
mastering your survival it's an Ever
it's a never-ending process what I'm
saying here is that you need to master
your survival for life because you can't
sustain authenticity when you need
something from someone else for survival
right if you can't if you aren't
self-reliant and able to generate an
independent income source and have a
sense of self-confidence that does not
require you you don't need anything from
others right so you can act
authentically every single individual on
this Earth has to self-actualize in
order to contribute to humanity in the
best way they can
self-actualization is to fulfill the
desire to become everything one can be
to actualize your potential while this
can be done with the perfect career path
that you find or create for yourself I I
can't help you there I haven't done that
right I'm here to help you with business
and self-improvement and everything that
I've done because that's what we're
talking about here you can go find
someone else if you don't resonate with
this message that's the point another
thing is that I I didn't choose that
route because I saw that you will never
have full control over your days or the
way that you make money or anything so
my recommendation is still the same I've
talked about this before many times but
you have to solve the biological
problems in your life improve your
health finances and socialization
discover your interests through
Improvement
and this takes time but it does not
limit you from making an independent
income
right now which we'll talk about in the
next video where I discuss the minimum
viable offer right so you can actually
just learn a skill and start selling it
and the other thing you have to
understand is that 95 of people's
problems revolves around survival based
problems right health wealth
relationships and happiness so if you
can solve that for yourself and then
create a system to help you do that like
a system in this case let's say it's
like a gym program that you create for
yourself that you don't copy from
someone else that's the key here you
have to figure it out for yourself so
that you actually have something that
you can bring to the market if you just
copy it what everyone else is doing and
never zoom out and create something of
your own then you aren't going to
succeed in this game you have to test
experiment fail and create a system that
resonates with you because you're
attracting people that resonate with you
another thing there is that people don't
learn best from someone that's 10 steps
ahead of them they learn best from
someone that is two steps ahead of them
right someone who is freshly solved the
problem and that's why I recommend
creating a course right because I
usually create my courses when I'm two
to three steps ahead of who I once was
right after I start seeing results and
of course I can iterate on the product
but then I'm able to position that
product to someone who was two steps
behind me then so it's Evergreen right
I'm not teaching from the extremely high
level that I'm at now so step number two
after mastering your survival is to
create your own philosophy there's
enough shallow advice on how to make
money how to get laid and various
methods for putting a Band-Aid over your
mental health we need more individuals
that are truth Seekers the individuals
that understand that step-by-step
shallow advice looks good on the outside
but is hollow on the inside we need more
people that can attack the root of
problems which is often metaphysical
spiritual or existential it's rarely
shallow self-help advice because that's
what the self-help advice came from was
from the philosophical stuff the world
is desperate for depth and that it you
can only create depth by forging your
own path philosophy is based on
experience and you have to self-reflect
to notice patterns in your life and you
need to study the greats and align those
and and find the patterns in their life
that aligns with your life you have to
set your mind on an Ideal future and
then you need to start and view the lent
view your problems and your day-to-day
actions from the lens of your ideal self
so that you have a compass for your
decision making because we aren't here
to get the same results that everyone
else has gotten for the past decade and
so as an example my ideal future is kind
of what I'm living right now because
that's what you do you just live your
ideal future and eventually the amount
of time you get to spend on that ideal
future becomes like fully actualized so
my ideal future is four hour work days
writing every single morning for like
two hours hitting the gym building
businesses or not even businesses but
side projects like I want to build uh
the Mastery facility which would be like
a co-working space a sick gym
and other things and expand modern
Mastery and build my software and just
do fun things and be able to eliminate
the things that I don't want to do and
that philosophy alone is much much
different from many others and so what I
do is I study the greats and I build
things and make mistakes and then I
align My Philosophy with certain aspects
of theirs I take the best from the
greats from multiple different ones and
make it my own that's how you forge a
unique philosophy and you have to be
open to change that philosophy along the
way when you encounter new information
or new ways of doing things better ways
of doing things so step number three is
to turn this philosophy along the way
into a public school that's what social
media is I'm convinced that the future
of schooling will be done online with
creators as teachers and each student
can join the school that aligns the most
with their interests values and
preferred method of learning one school
system would dominate 12 plus years of
their life so student would evolve
Beyond one creator-based school after a
few years of course and then they would
go on to the next and eventually they
would go on to start their own because
that's what you do that's the cyclical
nature of life that's what we're doing
throughout all of this stuff is we're
just passing on what we learn right in
in everyday life too that's why you
communicate with people you're just
passing on what you know your beliefs
what you're learning and everything else
in accordance with the conscious
subconscious or unconscious goal that
you were trying to achieve at that point
everything you do physically is goal
directed and not just physically but
mentally if you were not being if you
are not absolutely at one with the
present moment then it is goal directed
so you want to make it your life's work
to create a library of knowledge a
holistic library of knowledge for
everything that you are doing in life
you continue evolving your goals
continue evolving you continue moving
forward and you pass down the lessons
you learn along the way your idea ideas
beliefs opinions actionable advice
everything and you can notice this in
the Creator economy right I guarantee
that a lot of your favorite creators are
doing this exact thing even though they
may not be conscious of what they're
doing but they are doing a great thing
and they are going to stand out for
years to come and your public school is
digital real estate so I recommend uh at
least starting with top of funnel social
media to grow a broader audience like
Twitter LinkedIn Instagram sure
sometimes Tick Tock and then along the
way you can start things like YouTube
podcast newsletter or just a Blog to
start nurturing that audience and start
fleshing out your own ideas more because
the long-form stuff takes practice but
eventually you get very good at it and
then you can start to fuel that with
your top of funnel socials that you've
been growing this whole time and then
what your product will be is
implementation so you'll sell a variety
of low ticket products and then for the
people that want more for you or who who
have committed to you you will have high
ticket products like freelancing
coaching consulting or tutoring ring
which we'll talk about in the next video
and so this is what I've dedicated
myself to teaching because I see the
opportunity in this space so I offer the
two-hour writer course to help people
get their ideas out in a persuasive
impactful Manner and are able to distill
their philosophy and create this public
school through writing and then I offer
a higher ticket a bit more expensive
digital economics Master Class to
productize yourself for people that are
serious about making it work because
some aren't so they dabble in modern
Mastery or to our writer and then the
people that are serious and are
committed to my philosophy in order to
go and create their own they sign up for
digital economics and So eventually
after doing this and creating content
creating products and letting them
evolve and treating this as your life's
work and Distilling and distributing
your philosophy eventually you'll be
able to do whatever the you want
right it's like zubi where he can create
music he can go and sell a fitness
program if he likes I'm eventually going
to do some Fitness stuff because I want
to start that Mastery facility gym and
you have to think long term for this I'm
thinking like 10 20 years with all of
this so step number four is after
creating your own school is to create a
holistic solution as a product and so
I've worked with like 5 000 plus
creators and that's not exaggerating
that's under exaggerating and the
biggest problem that they face is that
they don't know what to sell or they
don't know how to make what they sell
unique and so of course I'm going to
talk about this in the next video but
I'll give you a basic run down here to
just provide some value so until then
here's what you do step one is to
identify a desirable goal so what is one
big goal in your life that you are
they're trying to achieve have achieved
or just achieved like very far in the
past right are you fit have you acquired
a certain skill like don't limit
yourself to like oh this only this thing
makes money so I can only sell that if
you've even acquired a skill right if
you know how to edit in a Adobe
Photoshop then sell a Photoshop
course right or just put a product on
the market if you know how to create a
website create a product called how to
create a website and improve from there
it doesn't have to be perfect because
until you actually get a product out you
have nothing to improve you have nothing
to iterate on and it just you're gonna
be
all of these lessons of life and
business lessons are going to be passing
you by because you don't have anywhere
to apply it so you have to start selling
something and so the key with this is
not to focus on the goal itself like oh
I learned how to create a website it's
the focus on the lifestyle it creates
for you right so why am I selling a
writing course not because like oh I
want to become a writer that's a part of
it but it's because of you should read
my landing page where I talk about how
cathartic it is to write it's helped my
thinking skills it's helped me think
clear it's helped me build an audience
that's helped me build a business where
I can really do
most of what I want or at least I have
like I know for 100 certainty that I can
create that life and so step number two
after creating a goal is to identify a
starting point right because marketing
is getting people people from point A to
point B with a unique solution so where
were you at in the past why didn't you
like being there right paint a picture
of the lifestyle you were living and
make the contrast between the lifestyle
that you have now what's different
what's beneficial what was painful about
the past what's beneficial about now
what's the why and so now you want to
outline a unique path so think of a book
right they have point a where there's a
problem that opens a curiosity Loop to
hook people into the book and then
there's a point B so the goal is
achieved the lifestyle is created the
dream happens and then along the way
there's chapters so what do people want
to know and this is where the holistic
solution comes into play because if I'm
creating a self-improvement product and
it's like the warrior program where
point B you're you have the you live the
life of a warrior right now what is
necessary there is it only Fitness no is
it only mindset no is it only business
no you tell me what is the synthesis
that you are going to use to create that
unique solution right it's it could be a
culmination of business principles
mindset advice a fitness program it
could be everything what is your way
have fun get creative what is your way
of getting them to point B so step
number five is of course to Branch into
new opportunity so this is a bit further
down the road but as you go about this
as you create products as you sell
products as you build your audience as
you uh create your community and
distribute your philosophy to your
community in the Creator economy that
cannot be saturated eventually you'll
have enough resources to pursue bigger
and better goals for yourself and
desaturate the market while still being
like on social media right and having a
good time and being like the Legacy
there or leaving your legacy and just
checking in and having a good time I
know Hamza did this recently even though
I think he's starting to do some like
YouTube stuff and sell something related
to that it's a good pivot but uh
yeah it's this just be conscious of
what's going on on social media and you
can create some good stuff so with that
I appreciate you like subscribe uh join
