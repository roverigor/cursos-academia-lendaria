people want to follow humans they don't
want to follow a search engine with a
face on it and with the rise of chat GPT
and future iterations of language AI
authenticity is more important than ever
now I have kind of a lot of views or
predictions for chat GPT I don't think
we've reached a point where we can draw
conclusions about who or what
specifically it's going to replace but
Replacements are on the horizon and I
talk about writing a good amount and so
I clearly get questions like hey what
are writers gonna do are writers out
going to be replaced by AI
and in short my beliefs fall along the
lines of if you think you're going to
get replaced by AI you're going to get
replaced by AI so you need to upskill
yourself or become more authentic you
see everyone is desperate for human
connection and frankly social media is
not delivering on that right I teach
social media in a sense I was a brand
advisor in my past I was a marketing
consultant at one point they're all kind
of the same thing it's just dependent on
who I'm targeting and how I position the
actual offer so I've consulted with a
bunch of different creators and
influencers and coaches and all these
other people that use social media as
their primary method for generating
traffic it seems kind of weird because
like that's kind of what I do is I use
social media as a modality for
attracting traffic because it's so
 big right there isn't really any
other choice I love working with
creators and so that's what I do but you
have to understand that most people
aren't being authentic you go to
someone's profile and it's either all
promotions or it's all just like
actionable advice which is good and
people tell you to post but it's the
same you could find online and by
online I mean like you can type into
Google and get the same answer right
that's not gonna separate you from the
crowd or make you any more authoritative
than the next person with their writing
or just content on social media so
authenticity from my predictions will be
the differentiating factor between those
that get replaced and those that make
the most money possible money isn't the
only reason to do this of course but
that's a driving factor for a lot of
people and that's what gets people
interested in this and then once they
develop that philosophical sense of
Mastery behind the writing itself then
it becomes much more meaningful it's
like when you get into the gym because
you want to just get jacked in big
muscles but if you do not back that with
a solid why an intrinsic reason to
continue doing that then it's just a
superficial shallow Pursuit and you're
gonna wake up one day with the body of a
60 year year old but with the mind of a
15 year old and so this is a reason
authenticity is one but just
diversification of interests in general
is why I talk about business content
writing uh philosophy spirituality some
different mixture of things here and
there and I like to think of it as like
diversifying your stock portfolio right
because then if one goes to you're
not absolutely and so it's the
same thing with interest in building
your personal brand if like one doesn't
get much engagement you aren't stuck to
that and just in this cycle like if your
main money making interest doesn't get a
lot of Engagement or you're just not
good about writing about it then your
brand is kind of stuck in this terrible
place and it's going to screw with your
head and make you want to quit make you
want to call everything a scam and just
pack it up and go sell a product for
someone else because you hate selling
you hate people selling products and you
don't realize that the way to get out is
to sell a product so I'm rambling a bit
I'll start to keep it focused from here
but I've worked directly and indirectly
with over 5000 creators some one-on-one
some uh not one-on-one with courses Etc
I've just worked with a lot of people
and this seems to be the most pressing
problem for them aside from the last
problem we talked about which is uh
creating your niche of one or choosing a
niche that's a huge problem the other
huge problem is being able to
incorporate your interests in a way that
is interesting but still maintains all
of your brand pillars right you need to
make an income from it or else you can't
do it full-time you have to stand out or
else chat GPT is going to replace you
maybe and this makes people quit before
things start getting good and so for
some Authority and just some backstory
because it's weird as I said a Creator
telling creators what to do I started as
a freelance web designer pivoted into
funnels understood marketing a lot more
started to position marketing Consulting
switching out of done for you work for
service businesses and then when I got
online and more immersed in the crater
economy and saw that it was the future
and that it is the new economy that's
for another video but then I
repositioned that same offer for
creators right and that's where it kind
of gets weird because I'm a Creator at
that point I'm a personal brand and so I
started as a Creator three years ago and
I did things kind of like I love testing
things right I love going against the
grain so I launched a product
immediately because I had experience and
I had Clarity on what to do I made a
good amount of money with a low
following by freelancing and not relying
on my following for my clients at that
point and leveraging other people's
audiences via affiliate or just
networking with them which we'll talk
about in the next video for actually
selling my product right because it
doesn't make sense to try to sell like a
50 product directly in the DMS that's
just not sustainable you're not going to
make a lot of money doing that but with
a freelance service where you're
charging one to three thousand dollars
then yeah you get two or three clients a
month and you're good to go so the other
thing that I did was I wrote about
whatever I wanted to right I wasn't in
that scarcity mindset of oh I need to
make money from my audience immediately
so I'm like I'm going to talk about
self-improvement I'm going to talk about
my fitness journey sometimes I'm going
to talk about emotional management oh
I'm reading this book that sounds cool I
like this idea I'm sure my audience
would like it as well I'm gonna share it
with them and then when it came to
actually promoting my services I would
include web design here and there like
actionable tips but I'd approach it from
a broad lens where it's like why you
should learn web design right
because not only does that attract
beginners you have to understand that if
I'm selling web design to someone that
means that they're a beginner whether
I'm doing it for them or not whether I'm
charging high prices or not they don't
know much about web design so not only
I'm attracting two types of people there
I'm attracting people that just want to
learn web design and I'm attracting
people that potentially need web design
done for them so not only can I sell a
product that teaches people how to do
web design but I can also sell a service
that allows me to do web design for them
and when I build this audience from this
multi-directional approach then I have
so much more room for leverage where if
I ever want to Pivot out of client work
which I did then I have a base audience
there that allows me to still use that
same skill set and help them with it and
so let me make this very simple for
those that don't know how to incorporate
their interests into their content
write about whatever you want in a way
that's interesting to practice your
writing and persuasion and when you plan
to promote create a promotion schedule
you aren't just promoting randomly I
hope where it's like yeah I'm gonna
promote under this post I'm gonna
promote under this post and then when I
don't promote I'm gonna get mad about
why I'm not making sales and it's
because I lack structure of my
promotions pull out your calendar and
just create a system start writing down
I'm going to promote on this day this
day this day and make it so it's
balanced right so you aren't promoting
all the time and then when it's time to
promote just incorporate more content
related to what you're promoting around
the promotions and then with time you
review that promotion strategy or
schedule every single month see what
went right see what went wrong
self-reflect and improve your system
over time until you have something that
is maintainable experience will teach
you much more than I can with this so
before we dive in I know that these
mid-roll promotions can get annoying but
solopreneur Sprints starts on February
7th we will bill the base of your
one-person business by creating your
niche of one writing 20 plus
foundational pieces of content I write
it with you on the screen and learning
how to network DM meet friends grow and
just have a strategy for actually
sustaining brand growth and this is the
last promotion so you don't have to
worry about another one in the next
video but if you're interested links in
the description check it out so if you
have no idea what to write about you
need to check out the last video which
is called the most profitable Niche is
you in that video we mapped out your
story right we created a book for you
that you fill in with chapters and then
you write those chapters with
newsletters content break it down into
short form posts reels tweets Instagram
posts Etc because you have to understand
like a lot of people don't know what to
write about or if they should write
about specific interests paint it like
this you need a goal you need a goal for
your ideal future what are you working
towards right think about that now what
interests help you get there and if you
have interest that you want to talk
about filter it through that right if I
want to talk about spirituality but I'm
I have a product that I base my brand
around around let's say marketing then
how are those two connected right
marketing
connects to psychology psychology
spirituality is like a philosophical
psychology in a sense and if if my end
goal is to just live autonomous
autonomously and be Sovereign
spirituality is going to play a huge
role in that so it makes sense to
incorporate it in your content so the
first step is to just choose two to
three interests that you want to write
about the second thing we're going to do
now is to broaden and break down because
most people start when I say write down
your interest most people start by
writing down like hyper specific
interests like biomechanical movement
for holistic health people and then they
get stressed out when so many when there
aren't many people interested in that
even further they get stressed out even
more which impacts their ability to
write good content because they think if
they don't talk about that main specific
interest that nobody is going to buy
from them that's not how it works my
friend zoom out so let's say that my
interests are web design spirituality
and weightlifting from those I want to
broaden them into the overarching Market
that they fit in web design would equal
online business or business in general
weightlifting would equal bodybuilding
or health in general spirituality would
equal self-actualization or Improvement
and all of those could really be
umbrella under self-improvement or
self-actualization even web design skill
acquisition is it plays a major role in
self-actualization so now that we have
three broad markets we want to
deconstruct and break them down into
sub-markets or subtopics that we can
write about over a long-term time span
with our content this isn't like one
week of content and your brand just
takes off and explodes this is like six
months of content so you can introduce
people to everything that you talk about
and everything that you know this is a
long-term game this isn't like a quick
direct response Facebook ad that is
trying to get you bought get you to buy
immediately Facebook ads and personal
branding are a lot different so the
beauty in this method that we're going
over right now is that if I want to sell
something related to like biomechanical
movement therapy then I can just start
talking about health as a whole and then
if you understand the customer levels of
awareness I would go research them but
in short it's like uh stage one is not
aware
stage two is problem aware stage three
is aware of the problem stage four is
aware that there's a solution stage five
is that they're aware of your product
right all of your audience is going to
fall within five of these levels of
awareness and your job is to hit all of
these with your content right your
promotions only hit that one of the
people that are aware and ready to pull
the trigger on your product well they
can kind of hit uh product I mean
solution aware as well but the other
three where the majority of your
audience lies you have to educate and
introduce them to the problems
associated with health and then slowly
guide them into how your specific Niche
interest that you plan to have a product
or service around can help them you are
not supposed to just attract people that
only know about your interest right this
is as I said this is personal branding
not advertising so with those three
broad interests that you have we're
going to you're going to take out a note
book but I've already broken them down
right so we're going to look at this
graphic I call this the topic tree I've
called it many things in the past the
content pyramid I like topic tree so at
the top is you right this is your niche
of one from the last video then you
break down you into three different
interests so let's say health
Improvement and business and then under
that you break those down into uh topics
let's just say topics and then beyond
that or sub topics right so Health
breaks down into nutrition bodybuilding
lifestyle and then under that there's
best exercises recipe ideas training
programs intermittent fasting daily
routine sleep tips these are all just
made up right so your job is to cover
all of these things that you write down
over the six to 12 months that you are
writing content I prefer to do it from
the top down so like a newsletter long
newsletter that can turn into a YouTube
video like this and then those can be
broken down into medium form content
like an Instagram caption long LinkedIn
post uh Twitter thread and then those
can be broken down even further or the
original newsletter can be used as idea
generation for tweets Instagram posts
Instagram reels tick tocks YouTube
shorts uh YouTube Community posts etc
etc so I talk about this like breaking
them down in writing format into our
writer
something you can check out as well but
this is how your brand perception is
formed right if someone only sees one
tweet from you that's all they know
about you right but if they see multiple
and the the expertise that you have in
certain areas then over the six to 12
months you're going to allow people to
understand who you are what you do and
why you do it so the next thing during
this is to remember the three pillars of
social leverage so the three pillars are
growth authenticity and authority and
when you strike a balance of all of
these which we've talked about in
previous one-person business series
videos I have a playlist for that but
you just want to approach from the angle
of okay I need to be building uh all of
these pillars up right I need to be
growing I need to be making sales and I
need to be authentic so I can stand out
from the crowd so with these top of mind
if you aren't growing pivot if you
aren't making sales pivot if you aren't
gaining loyal fans pivot iterate as you
get more real world feedback and you
don't have enough data or feedback after
two weeks of doing this you have to
post even if it sucks because even bad
posts they're data points good posts
they're data points you take both and
you dance between the two until all of
your content reaches new levels or
stages or baselines of development if
you want to go like an evolutionary
psychology lens approach to business so
now let's go I'm gonna I want to write
some content with you I've already
written them of course but we're going
to go over them and break them down and
we're going to do this in writing format
so it would fit in a tweet and I posted
these previously they did well but why
tweets why because they're the perfect
length for fitting a 280 character
persuasive heavy hitting message and
keeping concise and to the point it
really helps with your writing to try
and articulate your ideas within 280
characters and that's the perfect shape
for an Instagram post that copy paste
over to LinkedIn they're perfect for
short real scripts these are what I use
and then the good ones can be turned
into newsletter topics and then you just
start to create this endless content
flywheel of having a post do well
turning into a newsletter breaking that
down having new ideas do better turning
that into a post breaking it down etc
etc so we're going to be using marketing
as the topic here so the first style of
post that I want you to write is
actionable principles and that's simple
it's just a list of principles or
actionable steps that a beginner can
take to start to understand or use
marketing as our topic of choice and
this helps you build Authority in one
interest and for all of these things
that we go over please keep in mind that
you cannot like take take away the
principles of content writing you need a
hook you need a body and you need a
conclusion and these can overlap if you
are writing in like 280 character tweet
but in something like a newsletter these
need to be more fleshed out so let's
dive into the post your content sucks
because you don't hook in the reader
agitate their problem relate to their
problem give them a valuable solution
human psychology will always beat what
you think will work clear not clever so
at the top you see I have a hook in the
middle I have a body with actionable
steps or actionable principles relating
to marketing and then I wrap it up with
a conclusion right I just pretty much
give the big idea that I'm trying to put
across here and so I'm writing these on
the spot or I did so they won't be
perfect none of my content is it just
slowly gets better with time so try it
out write one of those tweets on your
own pick a topic from the topic tree
that you wrote out and practice it and
if you'd like it actually if you like it
or not post it so the next style that
we're going to talk about is the
importance of of a topic which is
similar to actionable principles but it
illustrates the why right it gives
people a reason to get interested in a
topic this is where most people suffer
because they don't know how to make
their interests interesting to other
people it's just importance continually
illustrating the importance or the why
of something because that's what really
changes human behavior right like if I I
didn't used to go on walks outside even
though I knew how beneficial it was or
how many people told me it was but once
I came across the right why where it's
like I don't need to do like 20 minutes
of intense cardio I could just go on a
30 minute walk twice a day and I'd be
good when I was trying to cut down uh
for the summer and then I continued
going on a walk learn that it's kind of
a game really started to enjoy it
develop that philosophical sense of
Mastery behind it and now it's just it's
a part of my day marketing is the
greatest skill you can learn why it
pairs with any other skill it teaches
you human psychology it helps you
monetize is a niche interest only a fool
expects to make an income without
learning the skill that turns scrollers
into customers so at the top again hook
lead into the body where it has three
lines of importance and then a
conclusion that wraps it up and here's
another great example from Taylin
Simmons on Twitter I came across this
and was like this actually fits
perfectly well but it says few habits
will make you feel as good as Daily Yoga
so yoga is the interest here that some
people may not think is interesting to
other people so he's introducing people
to the importance of it right so a daily
practice will calm your mind increase
your flexibility teach you to be present
give you kinky sex positions to try
right that interests a lot of people
whether you like it or not so throwing
in like a curveball not only makes them
rethink oh maybe I should try yoga but
it at least puts it on their radar right
remember the five stages of customer
awareness that's going to put it on the
radar and as more content comes from
Taylin in specific then they're slowly
going to get more introduced to yoga and
they may potentially buy a yoga tutorial
or a product or a yoga routine from him
try it within 30 days you'll feel 10
years younger so he does a really great
job there with the benefits as well
right A lot of people want to feel 10
years younger so he leverages that so
the next example and the last example
that we're going to go over is calling
out common mistakes or problems this
helps you establish Authority in your
interest right it shows like okay hey
this guy is helping people solve
problems in the thing that I am
interested in and I'm going to listen to
him because it sounds like he knows what
he's talking about stop writing
hyper-specific content as a beginner you
should be focused on growth make your
writing relatable focus on a common
problem talk about the topic from a high
level don't expect to grow if only a few
people would share your content so can
you see how I'm kind of writing these
tweets to like introduce you to this
stuff but you can try that out right
tackle a common problem within whatever
interest you have if it's bodybuilding
then maybe it's it's uh lifting the
weight too fast right and you could
easily write a tweet about that where
it's like most people lift weight too
fast it's killing your gains do this do
this do this instead it will make all
the difference I just wrote a tweet on
the spot that would probably for a
fitness audience with blah blah it's
relative it would get a lot of
Engagement now let's talk about getting
the most out of your content because
most beginners they struggle with seeing
the big picture of content creation
right it's just too overwhelming there's
too many moving pieces and it makes
sense I didn't actually get started with
creating content until I had gone
through all of these other business
failures and then when I got to actually
creating the content I'm like okay yeah
all of this makes sense this is what I'm
gonna do for the rest of my life so one
thing here to note is when you look like
self-awareness is the biggest business
hack I've said that a few times but it's
so true just observation and awareness
where if you were to read your content
right this is like becoming a mind
reader where if you're to read your
content from the lens of your audience
would they share it would you share it
if you were reading it do you even like
your own content and if you don't why
are you posting it and now I don't like
I don't want to make that seem like
you're you're not gonna like some of
your content but that's room for
improvement and so if if you come to the
conclusion that no someone wouldn't
share like or comment on my post and you
don't have a strategy for getting more
eyes on it which we'll talk about in the
next video but how do you expect to grow
right you can't just keep posting into
the void if your content wouldn't get
like shared and then potentially lead
someone to follow think about that as
well would if you're reading the content
would you click on the profile read the
bio and then follow if not where's the
Gap identify the Gap and then close it
so from the tweets that I wrote above
are they authoritative yes will they
attract a potential customer assuming
that I actually have a product or
service and that I occasionally talk
about the thing things revolving around
those products or Services yes are they
so specific that they won't get shared
no and this is the balance that you have
to strike with top of funnel social
media I'm talking Twitter Instagram
LinkedIn or YouTube and podcast if you
are trying to grow on those platforms
right at the beginning I traded my
podcast and YouTube kind of as like this
is what I want to talk about so I'm
going to talk about it but if it's
heavily influenced by the algorithm then
you're gonna have to go a bit more Broad
in some cases on a newsletter that's
really where you can talk about whatever
the you want but with the
newsletter you want to get a bit more
specific because that's usually where
you're nurturing an audience towards a
more advanced level so in the upper
three to five range of the customer
levels of awareness same thing with a
lead magnet right this is what some
people forget if I talk about let's say
emotional management and I'm selling web
design and I offer a lead magnet on web
design and I lead into that and it's
like hey do you want to learn a new
skill or do you have a business and you
want more customers there's a little bit
of a disconnect there but people are
still going to click on it become
educated on it without any of your doing
right once you write a lead magnet that
content is there and it's going to be
educating as many people that go through
it and then you can either pitch people
on your service there or they're on your
email list so they'll eventually buy
once you talk more about web design and
hit the right pain point so the next
thing to do to make the most of your
content let's say like the three pieces
of content that we wrote is to study the
best content structures you do this by
using something like tweet hunter or
twemx on Twitter or you can do this
without Timex or Twitter so you can try
this right so type into the Twitter
search bar
from colon V danco Space Min underscore
faves colon 1000 and so what that does
is it only shows tweets from me that
have a minimum likes of 1000 you can do
more uh crazy stuff with Twitter
advanced search but that is what I would
recommend recommend you do is look at
your favorite people your tribe of
mentors the people you aspire to write
like and just study all of their top
tweets and see how they're structured
and then from those structures you can
use similar topics and plug them into
that and rewrite them right so one of my
top tweets I have off the top of my head
where it's like the greatest skill is
decreasing the gap between idea and
execution so if I wanted to plug
marketing into that I could say the
greatest skill of the 21st century is
learning to capture attention right it
can be better than that but that's just
an idea right where the structure sorry
is already laid out there
and so me plugging in a new topic and
testing it out May do well and then if
that does well that leads into the next
thing of how to make the most of your
content which is repurpose the content
so we wrote multiple lists above right
and by list I mean like bullet point
tweets and from those you can turn those
into threads or Instagram captions or
Instagram carousels right if you go and
look at my stuff this is what I do all
the time where if I had that bullet
point list of the importance of learning
marketing then the hook of the thread or
the newsletter or the Instagram Carousel
is marketing is the greatest skill you
can learn and then I would use the last
line of that one tweet where it's like
Only Fools expect to make an income
without learning the skill that turns
viewers into customers here are the
three things you need to know and then I
can go over the three points of it pairs
with any other skill it teaches you
human psychology or it helps you
monetize a niche interest so to recap
everything we've talked about you can
and should incorporate your interest to
make your brand authentic create a topic
tree that you can master in 6 to 12
months through writing because teaching
and writing are like they go hand in
hand right you have to teach what you
learn in order to in order to identify
knowledge gaps in order to learn more
and truly become an expert I do believe
that teaching is a modality that the
internet has presented for individuals
to become experts in a field faster
write Multiple List style content pieces
to establish Authority in your main
interest broaden your writing if you
don't think it will be shared study the
best content structures use them as
training wheels and Branch off of what
you've already written this is all you
need to get started with content
creation if you pair it with the last
video the most profitable Niche is you
you are off to an absolutely incredible
start in terms of building leverage in
the next video we'll take that to the
next level so you can learn how to
network and grow and then after that
it's just about learning Marketing sales
advertising promotions how to create a
product and then you have a very
holistic brand and potentially your
life's work ahead of you so I hope you
enjoyed this one like subscribe comment

help you open your mind it's it's like a
Content ideation challenge but to me
it's brought more than that it's brought
articulation it's brought mental Clarity

and it's allowed me to create original
ideas from the ideas that I heavily
resonate with and allows me to spin them
in my own words so that is it uh again
hope you enjoyed see you in the next one
