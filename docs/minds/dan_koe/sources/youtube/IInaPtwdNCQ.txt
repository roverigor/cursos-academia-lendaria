I'm an introvert at heart and when I
went to college I was never the first to
engage in any type of social or
classroom situation and even my friend
group that I still have to this day we
kind of just stumbled upon each other in
the dorms like they approached me I
forget exactly how it was we were all
awkward at the beginning uh just getting
to school and we're like hey you guys
want to go walk to lunch or hang out and
then it's slowly built into this don't
even get me started about speaking in
front of the class or going to
networking meetups to meet new people
those just turned me off in every single
way I wanted nothing to do with them all
I wanted to do was sit in my dorm play
video games and work on the side
businesses that I was pursuing at the
time and this was before I realized that
being introverted isn't about being
anti-social being social is a skill not
a personality trait that can be improved
yet people hide behind their introverted
identity to avoid the inevitable discom
Comfort they are going to have to face
if they want to see success in any
domain of life like it doesn't make
sense to write off uh business or
something else that requires some form
of social interaction whether it be in
business or just relationships or
meeting new people like thinking of
yourself as an introvert in that way and
thinking that like 50 of the population
that is introverted just doesn't do
those things that is completely against
the point and so that was college but
now we're at the center of a new party
which is social media and I tried to
build a name for myself many times in
the past I started with a fitness
YouTube channel went on to create a
digital art page on Instagram even did
some photography a lot of Photography
actually if you go to the bottom like
scroll all the way to the bottom of my
Instagram page you can see what I'm
talking about here and then the next
thing was building multiple agencies or
just freelancing businesses and testing
out different tactics for growing and
selling on social media and then that's
when I stumbled across Twitter of all
places seriously nobody really uh
thought of Twitter back then and I would
argue that still
most people don't now because I thought
it was a place for like politics and
half-baked memes and the since the day I
downloaded it in like 2011 I just
remember vividly scrolling on Twitter
not seeing anything that I liked and
then I just deleted it deleted the app
from my phone for like 10 years but one
day when I decided to get back on
Twitter a tweet from Jose Rosado great
person go follow him on Twitter go
follow him everywhere a tweet of his
popped up on my timeline and it was some
form of like heavy hitting truth like a
harsh truth and I love that stuff that's
the kind of content that I really like
is like hey stop being a little
and go do this I'm pretty sure
that's that was Jose's thing at the time
is like stop being a little and so
that resonated really well with me and
so I followed him and I realized that he
wasn't just talking about
self-improvement he was talking about
online business which was what I was
interested in too so I was like oh this
is a steal this guy's talking about both
self-improvement and online business and
then by following him uh more accounts
got exposed to my feed either from
people that he retweeted or that I just
came across in the replies or you know
how you find people on social media it's
kind of just uh like the network effect
and before I knew it I was drowning in
high value Money Twitter advice and then
on Twitter I lurked without engaging or
doing anything that's the type of person
I am I just don't like engaging I don't
like commenting I'm an introvert right I
didn't want anything to do with it so I
just lurked for like six months until I
finally realized like it just hit me all
at once I'm like all of these people are
writing the same exact tweets that I
could be writing like I enjoy this
content because I could do the same
thing they're confirming my beliefs and
so why am I just sitting here consuming
when I could be doing the same exact
thing because they were clearly getting
leads followers sales they were growing
and actually making an income doing it
and all it took took was a little
mindset shift or shift in perception to
see from that lens of why am I not doing
the same exact thing I can do all of
this and so that alone it it sounds
cliche but that alone changed the
direction of my life so here is a
graphic to illustrate that the digital
world has no barriers we can see this is
the evolution of networking where 20
years ago you need college network
location profession status in order to
get opportunity today all you really
need is the internet because in the past
the only way to the top was your network
and your network was limited by your
physical location or the college the
prestigious college that you went to and
climbing your way up the ladder then
introverts didn't stand a chance
especially me at that time if I would
have gone to college in the past I would
have been I would have been out
of a job I wouldn't have been doing
anything because I wouldn't be social
enough to actually make that happen so
in the past you couldn't like we take
this for granted we don't actually sit
and think about it but you can DM a
celebrity and if your DM is good like if
you're a good persuasive writer which is
a skill right it's not like just nobody
gets access to these celebrities the the
people you want to DM there is a string
of words that you can say that will get
them to respond and even in a like a
freelancer or an agency owner uh their
case in the past you wouldn't be able to
just DM a client walk them through some
kind of like strategized messaging to
open them up to your service and then
get them to pay you twenty five hundred
five thousand ten thousand I know some
people are even charging sixty thousand
dollars for services through the DMS do
you not see how insane that is
like most people would kill for sixty
thousand dollars so if you can just up
skill yourself a little bit for three to
six months in order to be able to create
a freelancing Consulting coaching
service from the start start reaching
out to people because the digital world
has no barriers and then pull in an
income for yourself by charging low like
500 to a thousand getting results
improving your skill stack charging more
learning how how to create a system that
solves a specific problem within a
specific Niche and then charging even
more to get more results and then by
that time if you're growing an audience
and you productize like it's very clear
what people should be doing but this is
all modern in the past you had to go to
school you had to get good grades you
had to apply to a prestigious College
get accepted and then do all of this
fancy work to become like rise to the
top of the ladder and whatever
compartment or Department of that
education you wanted to go into and then
you had to be extroverted enough to
actually form real connections with
these people so that they would pass
opportunities off to you rather than the
next guy and so in the past people had
to work their ass off in order to get
the limited opportunities that were
available but now there's just an
overabundance of opportunities and
options that make people overwhelmed
uncertain and so they flock to the
secure career systems you could call
them that have been developed over time
that the schools are tightly closed with
and so think about it the the person
that you read just now in the comments
they need a website and you could
fulfill that service and the tweet that
you just scrolled by that guy needs a
video editor and the person on some
subreddit they want to learn how to be
happy they have a problem in their life
they're not sure how to solve it and
maybe you can come in and help them the
internet gives you indirect access to
the 4.9 billion people that are on it
and all it takes is one piece of content
right this is all media this is all
content where it takes one piece of
content for someone to like just it'll
just land somewhere right let's say it
was a good piece of content someone
retweeted it then a big account saw it
they retweeted it and then another huge
account saw it it got put on a meme page
maybe it got mentioned in the news this
is like way overly optimal case but this
can happen to anyone right it's just a
matter of learning how to write a good
piece of media and then having it spread
to whatever part of the internet you
could get to and then people know your
name people start to know what you do
and then if you attract them to your
audience and you have content going for
you then you nurture them they get to
know you more and then if you eventually
have a product or service that you can
offer them in order to pull in an income
so networking even though I don't like
that word networking just I like making
friends is a better way to put it but
networking is the pillar of My Success
Jose Rosado was the first person that I
reached out to from my memory I ended up
signing on to his coaching program which
was a great program this was like three
years ago and the cool thing is about
this is that both Jose and I were in
like slightly different niches kind of
we talk about some same things we talk
about some different things but that
just goes to show that like people can
be unique even if we're in very similar
domains and so another example is Joey
Justice if you're in modern Mastery you
know who Joey is if you're on Twitter
you probably know who Joey is but we hit
it off like way back when when we first
both started on Twitter and now I'm
flying out to see him in early March I'm
I've seen him multiple times he's a very
good friend of mine and it's just crazy
what happens when you start actually
putting yourself out there and we helped
each other with our services at the
start I helped him get his I like
offered my services to him for free in
order for him to get a testimonial from
me and to just make his better and he
offered coaching to me so it's like vice
versa that's kind of how it works in the
Creator economy is you just make friends
you help each other and then you use
those strategies to help others and even
last year I moved to Texas with Dakota
Robertson and JK Molina that I met on
Twitter and I've also met great people
like Justin Welsh sahil Bloom Dickie
Bush I had uh dinner with Dickie bush
like a few weeks ago I've talked with
others it's just genuinely insane what
kind of like-minded people that are
ambitious in life and achieving good
things you can find on the internet if
you actually look for them because most
people don't approach social media with
this mindset they approach social media
with the mindset of I want to be
educated and entertained it doesn't even
cross their mind that they could reach
out to this person and become friends
with them I'm talking about like people
that are within a similar follower range
as them and then grow together and offer
their value in front of potentially 4.9
billion people on the internet so if
you're in this Creator game or this one
person business game if you're not on
social media you've already lost this is
kind of a given I don't care if it's
like paid ads or building a personal
brand in general I recommend building a
personal brand but if you're not on
social media at all I don't know what
you're doing and then go and talk to any
Creator or one person business owner
that you know and ask them what the most
important part of their success is and
they're going to tell you it's
networking if they don't
I don't know what to tell you so when
you don't have an audience which
everyone does not have an audience at
the start DMS are how you get in front
of people and you start making
connections Freelancers understand this
well for landing clients but the average
person that is just trying to grow on
social media they don't see the
importance of it and so that's what this
video is for because I've seen I've seen
people land job offers right this isn't
only for people that are uh trying to
start a business this is for anyone that
is looking to advance their career I've
seen people with tweets that go viral
when they have very low followers simply
because they are friends with someone
that has a lot of followers and they
shared it and so people usually fall
into two camps here first is that they
don't understand the sheer power and
network effect of dming people on a
consistent basis the second is that they
don't understand that you can get large
accounts to share your post if you are
strategic enough so this is clearly
about how to send a good DM but most
people suck at sending DMS or they don't
know how to do it so I want to preface
with this like no shade on you if you've
done this before but from here on out
never ever ever ever ever
 ever send a DM that starts with
starts and ends with hi or hey how are
you can you follow me back a straight
sales pitch with no prior connection a
long block of text that takes too much
time to read especially if the sentences
aren't spaced out you have to approach
DMS tactically especially if you're
reaching out to Big accounts that get 10
plus DMS an hour I would say that I get
10 plus DMS on almost every single
platform every single hour and so you
have to understand that like I'm not one
I just do not have the physical
capability of replying to all of those
DMS especially because it's not just one
dm back it's usually a question and then
I answer and then the DMS compound so if
I start answering people the number goes
from 10 plus DMS to like 40 plus DMS
every single hour so you have to keep in
mind that people with a large following
that you're trying to get in front of
they're just skimming through DMs to see
if they're missing anything important to
the point where it's like an email
subject line or a hook for a piece of
content or a headline for an article you
have to capture attention with what they
can see and you have to be strategic
about what you're going to say so let's
dive into the seven steps to non-needy
networking this started out as a guide
in digital economics and then it got
repurposed into two-hour writer to help
people get eyes on their writing and
then I put in modern Mastery it's just a
very important process to understand
this is foundational for anyone trying
to grow business or just improve their
career or just get online and so the
main purpose of this really when we peel
it all back is to get your name in front
of people's eyes and in their mouths
because even Freelancers struggle with
thinking that they're just in this
constant cycle of I need to reach out to
this guy and then the conversation ends
if they never respond no if you reach
out to 100 people and you were kind and
you had value to offer and you walk
through the process that we're going to
go through then there even if they can't
like help you with anything they're
gonna have you top of mind for the next
person that comes to them and asks if
they know anyone that can help with web
design email marketing uh Fitness
whatever it may be so the first step is
to find somebody that you want to DM you
want to DM and this isn't exclusive to
just making connections this is crucial
for paid work as well so many
Freelancers choose niches that they
don't give a about and then their
entire they're just put themselves in
this like terrible place where
they hate reaching out to people because
they hate the people that they're
reaching out to they hate working with
the people so they hate the work that
they're doing for the people and then
they just build themselves into an
another miserable nine to five so this
is a crucial step is just to reach out
to people that you actually want to
connect with so reach out to people that
you are inspired by or you would want to
work with you would want to strategize
with or you see potential for Mutual
benefit and when you're just starting
out you kind of have to work your way up
the ladder right because there's so many
different moving pieces with all of this
it's impossible to explain in one video
but just one example if if I have zero
followers and I'm reaching out to
someone with a hundred thousand and by
chance they open my DM and then they
look at my profile there's like yes this
is a bit superficial but there's there's
not really anything you can offer me I
see Zero followers and I think okay
we're in the social media game this guy
hasn't put in any time at all how is he
gonna help me and of course there's a
lot more Nuance to that and so once you
have an audience and leverage you can
really reach out to anyone you want if
you have a hundred thousand to a million
followers you have a lot more social
proof because that shows that you've
been in the game for a while that you're
offering some form of value that it's
just like a badge saying that like hey
I've stuck this out for a bit and I've
actually proven myself and so when I
reach out to someone and I have like a
million followers I'll get a response
from almost anyone and so you're
probably asking where do I find people
to DM well I'm assuming that you follow
people that you either want to connect
with or can help you grow or that you
want to work with right you follow at
least one of those people so from that
one person go and look at their
following list right this is probably
zero to a thousand people that they
follow look through that list spend some
time going through the accounts find
like-minded accounts or just find people
that you'd want to connect with follow
them start replying to them engage with
them and then eventually walk through
this process of dming them so the first
thing that you send is an inspired
compliment this is step two so you can
find a piece of their content work or
just something that they've done that
truly inspires you or that you like or
it it gave you an Insight that you want
to share with them and then you send
that to them so let's say it's like a
tweet that I resonated with and I'm
going to send that person the tweet and
be like hey man explain what I liked
about it and then go from there and so
people love praise and there's this
thing called The Law of reciprocity
where if you give value to someone else
and praise is a form of value then they
feel obligated to give it in return so
let's let's pretend that I wrote a tweet
on managing emotions this is what I
would say what's up Dan this tweet Hit
me hard I've been going through it the
past couple of days and this instantly
gave me some relief thank you and then I
add the link to the post they liked
simple as that step number three is to
show genuine interest in them so if they
don't respond from this you can just
reach out again in the same manner send
them something that you liked and keep
doing that until they respond and so
showing interest is communication 101
showing interest makes you interesting
so ask them about their goals what
they're building what they do for work
this gives you the opportunity to give
value even if you don't have the value
to give right now so let's assume that
they just respond with the generic thank
you so much and that was to the last
message and now you can go to their
profile find what they're working on or
just a goal that they have and try to
assume it so if you find what they're
working on you can say something like
what are your next plans for modern math
history it's been crazy seeing it grow
I'm curious what you've got in store if
you can't find what they're working on
do you have anything that you're
building right now with that kind of
content you must have something bigger
in the works so step number four is to
lead with value this is the part that
trips most people up because most people
don't think they have value to give so
your first options are to see where you
can help send actionable tips if you
personally have them or you can send
resources videos articles or anything
that may help with them building what
they're building in accordance with
their goal and so if you have to ask
more questions in order to get more
specific on what they're building so
that you can actually help them with
that then do so ask more questions in
between these so if you have no value to
give you can send a resource that can
help them with their goals connect them
with someone else in your network just
continue having a good conversation and
showing interest show that you're
interested in helping them so step
number five is to get on a call to make
a deeper connection so this part is
optional but highly recommend did you
don't have to get on a call with someone
but I would practice it right especially
if you're an introvert it helps a lot to
be able to get on a zoom call and just
talk with someone because making that
face-to-face connection is priceless
right especially on the internet where
nobody really knows your mannerisms they
don't know how you talk outside of like
a scripted real or post and it just
helps to mesh on that personal level and
so when I was starting out I was getting
on Zoom calls left and right even if I
didn't feel like it I remember being so
anxious one time when I was dming
someone with like 50 000 followers I was
just like oh my God this guy like it's
crazy I can't believe I'm even getting
on a call with him and then you realize
that every single person behind a high
following count is human too they're
just like you and so people think that
getting on a zoom call is weird because
one they haven't done it and it's it's a
lot more normal than you think if you
just ask someone hey you want to get on
call and like I can help out with what
you're building or we can just talk shop
and have a good time and so it also
helps to just take the conversation to
somewhere like telegram or Whatsapp
where you can send them like a voice
message right you can make it more
personal and now I mentioned WhatsApp
there's people in the replies of these
YouTube videos I'm gonna get you one day
 but there's like these
scammers that have their name as like
WhatsApp and then a number and they have
my profile picture that's so weird like
it I'm sorry I'm sorry if you guys like
click on that you're an idiot don't
click on those things so step number six
is to follow up with value right you've
waited some time you've gotten on a call
with them maybe there's some space
between the messages the the
conversation fizzled out but it helps to
strengthen that or just like keep that
connection going
oh my God my tax guy's calling me hey
how are you man yeah sounds good man I
really appreciate it so when you're
following up with value you want to
remember their goals right you want to
have their goals top of mind so when you
come across something or you find
something interesting just as you're
consuming content or you're reading
books or you're watching YouTube videos
or you're building stuff out then you
can think to send it to them in order to
just continue providing value to them
I've done this before with like content
systems that I built out or like notion
templates that I've built out and if I
feel like it'll benefit one of my
friends and my network then I'm gonna
send it to them and just be like hey man
I built this out maybe it'll help with
XYZ and so if you want like a hard
script to practice I don't recommend
like copy pasting any of these just use
your own voice but if I were to give a
script it would just be I remember you
telling me about your plans for their
project or goal I found this today and
thought you'd find it helpful so it
could be a YouTube video or it could be
really anything that you just feel like
they would benefit from so the last step
step number seven is to follow up with
an Ask notice how we provided value
we've followed up with value all of of
this is variable right you don't have to
do it exactly in this order these are
kind of just the principles and if you
study influence or persuasion you'll
understand this a lot more so I'd
recommend like the book influenced by
Robert cialdini but by this point you've
built a pretty damn solid connection
without asking for anything yet and
understand this is a long game as well
right if you're here to just like get a
quick payment from them or get like a
quick retweet from someone or a Quick
Share like you may succeed but it's not
sustainable you're not building an
actual like good Network that you can
rely on and so at this point you can ask
them to join a mastermind group send
them one of your posts that you've put a
lot of time into because they may share
or retweet that right you don't even
have to ask them to retweet it they
could just share it and the third is ask
any specific questions you have for them
without paying for Consulting right so
this is like what a lot of people Miss
is they'll just shoot a message
immediately to someone and expect like a
thought out answer when there's no
relationship there and so if you have a
burning question that you want answered
then you should practice building a
relationship because a lot of the time I
mean
some people do this I haven't really
done it in the past but I know there's
some like big big people where someone
will send them a question
because they don't take into account how
much time like they're busy people and
so the person will send them like a link
and be like hey you can sign up for a
Consulting call here and it's like a
thousand bucks right and so no one's
going to pay that but if you actually
network with this person you show their
that you're a cool person and a real
person then you can usually ask
questions and get answers because they
like you and so if your plan is to
leverage these people for audience
growth then you need to write a tweet
that they would think about retweeting
right so you could write a tweet that
mentions a topic that you learn from
them you can write a post on Instagram
and tag them in it because you inspired
a part of that post and then when you
send that to them you just be like yo
just wrote this up and thought you'd
enjoy it it was inspired by our previous
conversation and if they're tagged in it
then there's Mutual benefit because if
they share it and that post gets
traction it just looks better for them
anyways and so for DMS you should be
reaching out to people every single day
right I'm assuming if you want to become
a Creator you're a solopreneur one
person business you are
in the space to not only learn and
produce and meet people
but that's exactly it is you're there to
meet people if you like someone's post
DM them and tell them you like it if you
like someone's reply like it engage with
it and just be like hey man I love that
reply on the post like it's so easy to
just send a DM to thank people for what
they're doing online and so there's a
bonus tip number eight because you might
be thinking Dan won't this take a lot of
time it's like yes obviously zoom out
and see the big picture if it's going to
take you four years to get a formal
education and a degree and then another
10 years to actually work your way up
the ladder to a reasonable salary that
you can live with then it's going to
take a few months years it's going to
take some time to build your own thing
and all of this is ironic because the
uncertain or the uncomfortable path or
doing your own thing is the only Quick
Fix out there and when I say quick I
just mean like an expanded time Horizon
it could take you two years to start
making ten twenty fifty thousand dollars
a month by building your own thing but
then people love the certainty of like
oh I go to college for four years I get
to take a break I get to go and work for
this cool big status based company and
then work my way up the ladder from
fifty thousand dollars a year to a
hundred thousand dollars a year and then
get capped there and then eventually
start my own thing and maybe spend a few
years doing that when you could have
just done it from the start that's why
the digital world has no barriers this
is such an important thing we do not
live in the world that we lived in 10
years ago you live right now and there's
ample opportunity to build whatever the
 you want and so another thing is
bringing your ideal future the actions
you're going to be taking then anyways
Into the Now is something that you
should be doing if you want to be a
writer and you're not writing for 10 20
minutes even an hour a day and then just
scaling it up as you are able to make
that more sustainable in your life
that's what you do if you're gonna have
to DM people anyways when it comes time
to start building your own thing you
should be doing it right now so start
with dming two people a day you like
their content DM them then bump it up to
5 bump it up to 10. I promise that alone
will just change everything
because the the thing with this is is
like oh you
like why why would I do these things if
I'm not being paid for it
do you do you see the dissonance there
there's a huge dissonance where it's
like you're not going to be able to get
paid for it until you have enough
practice from doing it without getting
paid in order to get paid and preferably
it's something you like doing like if
you're going to be writing every day in
the future and getting paid for it but
you're not writing every day right now
and working your way up in terms of
income then I I don't know what you're
doing like
I'm feeling feisty today so just
