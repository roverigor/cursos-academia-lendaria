these videos are always the hardest to
make there will be little practical
advice most of it will be abstract
big picture thinking in hopes that it
can help you gain perspective to see the
situation that you are in from a new
light because I love observing patterns
in my own life I love reflecting and
seeing the same phenomenon happen time
and time again but from a place of
Newfound experience from which I can
correct my actions to
see future situations that happen from a
better more holistic light in which I do
not have to be very reactionary about or
get super upset or emotional about and
there's been a meta pattern that I've
noticed in my life time and time again
which helps illustrate the story that is
life so you can identify which phase of
life you're in and be able to make
decisions according to that and so it
goes something like this there are four
phases and the first is the clarity
phase Insight strikes and a purpose
reveals itself a vision that I can start
to work towards I have the skills to
make it work all that's left is for me
to accept the challenge the next phase
is the intensity phase where pure
progress is being made flow state is
almost permanent the skill set I've
acquired is laying the foundation for my
business relationships level of mind and
quality of life the third phase is the
consistency phase I felt pressure to
sustain the progress that I had made
this required systemization
prioritization and sacrifice that felt
like a gradual decline into chaos
because massive progress was not being
made and then the fourth and Final Phase
is the most disastrous it is the Lost
phase I actualized the purpose I had set
out for in the clarity phase my mind
filled with doubts about the future a
highly mental and spiritual phase that a
majority of people get stuck in if they
don't learn how to navigate the dark
when I finished my book The Art of focus
that is going on pre-sale soon launching
soon I kind of just fell it felt like I
fell off a cliff right I'd been building
for three years I had something to focus
my attention on for so long a project to
pour my energy in and to base all of my
actions around right my my nutrition was
based around how do I
operate at my Peak mentally so I can
pour my creativity into this book what
lifestyle am I going to create that
favors idea generation and creativity uh
what are other decisions that had to be
made like waking up early to get
straight into writing the book so I
still have time to finish the other
tasks of my day my entire day was
structured around this project and
that's how it goes for many people in
multiple phases of life where they have
one purpose which is what we'll dig into
further and the thing is is that when
you get into this phase of feeling lost
you don't know where you're at when you
flip the page to a new chapter you're
lost there's no purpose you you haven't
even experienced the rising action yet
that gives Clarity to what that purpose
is it may be hinted at or or you're
curious about what it is and that's what
gets you interested in reading the book
or the chapter and so these phases of
feeling lost can be extremely dangerous
but I've slowly learned to be at peace
with them right I've been a lot less
reactionary and emotional than I would
have been let's say five years ago now
it's more so I observe it I'm aware of
what I'm going through I've experienced
this book before how do I how do I just
let go and give myself the space to
realize like what the next purpose is in
my life and so these phases all four of
them not just the loss phase encapsulate
a few principles that I want to make
known from the start the first is novel
emergence so after every battle or
conflict conflicts struggle at any plane
of existence physical mental Cosmic
animalistic whatever it may be when
there is conflict when that tension is
released something new emerges when a
star has tension and eventually explodes
it creates Atomic nuclei that goes and
creates it it becomes the resource for
creation in the cosmos and then after
let's say a world war or a war between
nations while many perceive that as bad
and there are obviously bad things about
it because it's destruction but on the
other side there is medical advancements
that have changed the path of human
evolution what about on the personal
level right on the personal level in our
minds the same thing happens where
there's conflict there's struggle and
we're in this deep emotional trench
where we fight with ourselves until the
tension finally resolves Itself by us
letting go and we let the vision emerge
we let the Insight crash into our psyche
and so the lesson there is that struggle
or suffering is a necessary part of life
every single [ __ ] person experiences
it and it is supposed to be there
because without it progress would not be
made we wouldn't evolve we wouldn't be
here we would have died off already
there's no problems to solve to move
forward there's nothing to focus our
attention on to build and create towards
and so the next principle is
impermanence and entropy in short this
this is both both a like Buddhist
teaching systems principle where things
just fall apart with time and that
nothing lasts forever and that nothing
is permanent no matter how permanent it
may seem and that means that this is
this goes beyond physical or material
this goes towards the phases of your
life that you can notice in patterns
with your mind if you choose to reflect
consistently on your life and so you
understand okay this phase of feeling
lost isn't going to last it's not
permanent this phase of absolute
progress where I'm on top of the world
is not going to last it's going to come
crashing down or this phase of where I'm
like in limbo maintaining consistency
that's not going to last either
Nothing's Gonna Last and you have to be
ready to observe and move within that
Universe one song that is what you are
smack in the middle of it's a quote from
my book The Art of focus I'm going to
start plugging that more life unfolds in
chapters and phases books songs stories
architecture bodybuilding life setup
really relationships mental health and
every other form of human creation
reflect this pattern being able to zoom
out and see what is happening beyond
your thoughts can save you from a world
of pain because it's helpful to know
what part of this Everlasting book you
are in or this Everlasting song right
and the harmony the the highs and lows
that are playing together at this moment
in your life and you choosing your ego
choosing to perceive one of those
usually a low a negative and block out
everything else that's happening around
you and when you do that all you see is
negativity because you're just so
narrowed in on it you're not open you're
not you haven't zoomed out and gained
the resources necessary to zoom back in
from a place of perspective and make
forward progress in the world without a
worry because for each chapter of a book
there is a purpose or goal that must be
actualized and at the beginning of the
chapter whatever chapter you're in you
have to acclimate to the environment
that you chose to be in like when you
move to a new city and you're just
thrown into this new chapter in one area
of your life right this is not not only
is this one book for your life as a
whole but subsequent sub books within
that big book each with their own
chapter and that goes down infinitely
forever into every facet of your life
this is divine because when you move to
a new city you haven't acclimated to the
environment your mind hasn't ordered
itself based on your conscious decisions
to form actions and routines around the
things you like to do what grocery store
are you going to which roads are you
going to take to get there do you
understand how to navigate the city
itself uh how good does it feel when you
are navigating the city and you discover
something new because you are open to
discovering in the unknown that is one
thing that most people don't take into
their everyday life is they are so
closed off to the lack of certainty that
they experience when they go into a new
phase of life and this goes for any
other domain of your life like Health
relationships business when you start
something new or you achieve a big goal
and subsequently drop down into this low
it it's uncomfortable at first but then
it starts to become normal just as you
acclimate to that environment over the
weeks and so then from that once you
begin to acclimate you can start to
perceive everything around you from a
state of decreased stress because things
have become normalized and that allows
your mind to be open to new potentials
and then in the middle of the chapter
once you gain that Clarity once you
understand what the purpose is once it
comes to you then you can start making
immense progress you kind of just go all
in on it and then Everything feels
smooth you reach the climax of the story
in that chapter and as the chapter nears
its end you've made significant progress
but your mind starts to decline into a
new low because you don't know what the
next chapter holds you know it's coming
you just feel off you know that you're
not making as much progress as you can
be and you now know that nothing is
permanent and you kind of just have to
flow with it and let it happen there is
wisdom and feeling lost it means that
there is potential to find your way but
for most people feeling lost becomes an
eternal struggle they get consumed by
their thoughts emotions and low level
responsibilities that prevent them from
seeing or creating the light at the end
of the tunnel this is dangerous very
dangerous because if you only have
access to a mental bubble of certain
thoughts and solutions then you may
never find your way out and
unfortunately this is a common
occurrence right because you get
launched into this or you just feel
uneasy you feel uncertain and that adds
stress to your life and stress can be
very good for pushing you towards
certain goals but when you're in this
state of not being able to think clearly
which is 99 of the population then you
you must understand that most people
adopt goals that they are told to adopt
that are assigned to them and then they
go and they get on this hamster wheel of
okay I'm gonna pursue this goal of let's
say getting a high paying job which
there's nothing wrong with that's not
what I'm saying I'm saying that most
that's not by most people's own
conscious reasoning as to why they're
actually pursuing it they go they pursue
it and then they realize okay what's
next and then they choose another goal
and none of these are self-generated
none of these are actually what they
want to do and they're slowly digging
them ourselves further into a hole
rather than being able to climb upwards
so they can see the past mistakes that
they've made and by their own conscious
Choice make better decisions with time
if you're consistently digging yourself
down and going lower levels into
unconsciousness then you can't it's very
it's much more difficult to look back up
and see okay these are the mistakes I
made instead you have to climb your way
up and then you can see from the top
down oh these are the mistakes I made
this is a massive [ __ ] problem is
that so many people are Mindless
autopilot living surface level living
digging themselves deeper and deeper and
deeper and it's so much harder to get
out because that's just the thing is
what's next when you reach that phase of
feeling lost what comes next right what
happens when you break up with someone
what happens when you leave school what
happens when you decide to change jobs
and that question of what's next can
either lead to despair or a chance to
discover new potentials for your life
depending on how how you perceive that
question what's next and the way to do
this is to zoom out or expand your focus
or just realize that struggle is a
universal principle and that everyone
experiences it it's not only happening
to you because humans have been around
for a long time we understand psychology
we understand that most people have a
very similar psychology and they
experience the same emotions that's how
we relate to each other and everyone is
going through a different phase a
different chapter a different book
different sub book at any given phase in
their life and once you can see that and
be conscious and have that higher
Consciousness like let's say Jesus
Christ not
bring religion into this but that's what
he was he was a high Consciousness
individual like Buddha and other
leaders and so once you have that level
and that empathy and you're able to see
that and try to sustain that throughout
your days then Things become much more
easier you're less stressed and from
this state you allow ideas to culminate
you allow inklings to kind of Stack up
into this Vision that you can go and
pursue and lead people towards and
create in alignment with you must
Embrace feeling lost let go surrender
don't fight with it flow with it be at
one with it not at war with it and make
a conscious effort to expose yourself to
experience read a new book buy a new
course meet new people have deeper
conversations watch new content Journal
more write more hit the gym go on a hike
swim in the environments and information
that allow ideas to collect in your
subconscious almost everybody gets
trapped in this phase that would explain
the state of society you do have to have
some form of paranoia sitting in the
back of your mind right that's what
pushes us to move towards our goals that
is a law of the Jungle so to say is that
everyone has that little thing in the
back of their mind where if I don't me
if I don't move right you can't stand
still if you don't move you will die so
when you're in the fog you must stay
cerebral you have to look for a Ladder
rung that or you have to be vigilant of
a Ladder rung swinging by and you have
to grab it so now once you've sat with
that emotional turmoil you're in that
state of feeling lost you felt it you've
acclimated to the environment you've
become aware of your own mind and how it
starts to interpret things from a more
like reactionary lens and judgmental
lens and you can start to overcome that
you have to begin to expose yourself to
those new potentials right you have to
grab the Ladder rung you have to try
those new things you have to expose
yourself to information that allows the
vision to culminate that allows the
purpose to make itself known to you it's
not just going to come to you if you're
[ __ ] sitting there doing nothing and
then once that self-generated goal comes
into play or that purpose you know what
at least what you think you want to do
right it's not an absolute I know this
is exactly what I do and it's going to
turn out this way this way this way it's
like no I have a soft idea
and I'm going to act towards it and I'm
going to educate myself in alignment
with it and I'm going to acquire the
skills necessary to make it work because
if you have the vision to start a
business then you obviously need the
skills to start a business right but
people make the crucial mistake of
learning and never starting right and
then they get stuck in the clarity phase
and then it just turns into another lost
phase you don't enter the intensity
phase and so what you have to do is you
have to actually move you have to use
your mind to create in the physical
world you have to apply what you learn
as you're building and my favorite way
to do this I've talked about this in the
previous video about how I learn new
skills fast or something related to that
where it's start build learn you start
the project you build you begin stacking
bricks with what you know because you've
gained Clarity to the point of actually
being able to act or else you wouldn't
have the clarity or knowledge you've
already consumed some of the information
and then once you hit a specific problem
you seek to solve that problem through
information whether it be from content
YouTube videos mentor coaches courses
Etc that can help you solve that
specific problem to burst through that
Gap reach the new level and then
perceive your previous level from a
state of that self-reflection and so you
can continue correcting until you see
some form of objective success in
something like business and so during
this as you're building momentum you
enter into what I call an intensity
phase and in this phase you have
complete Clarity on what you must do you
have a tangible aspect of life that you
are making progress in you don't want to
do anything aside from work because work
is the funnest thing you could be doing
this blur of pure progress usually lasts
one to three months more or less and if
you need something to channel your
attention into and something more big
picture holistic that actually gets
results in these times in the modern
times I have to our writer in digital
economics right so learning a high
income skill or a high value skill to be
able to channel your Creative Energy and
actually see tangible results that pay
10 times more to you and how to
productize yourself in digital economics
which allows you to discover your life's
work create your vision for the future
and have something to actually Focus
your attention on in the mornings or
whenever you dedicate that time to do so
and it brings so much order and Clarity
to your life knowing that you are doing
you are working towards doing what you
love in a way that actually makes sense
and isn't it doesn't feel wrong it's
it's what you're supposed to be doing I
feel like as if I've cracked that code
and I need to share it with you so once
you reach once you've gone up that
upward trend of making progress and
building momentum you eventually reach
the intensity threshold where you can't
make any more progress you've exhausted
that vessel that you've been
pulling from or having to fill with
resources from reality you've exhausted
that
or of reality and you have to move on to
something new but that new something is
the new purpose that you don't know of
yet and so you can try sustaining it but
it's just not going to be any more
fulfilling and so you eventually come
down
and go into what's called an a
consistency phase but you're slowly
declining into another loss phase and
you have to be vigilant of that when
that's happening so the way I like to
paint the picture of a consistency phase
is by understanding the three phases in
bodybuilding right there's a bulking
cutting and maintenance cycle we can
think of cutting as gaining Clarity
where you let go of the fat physical or
mental to reveal what you've built from
previous bulking cycles and we can think
of bulking as the intensity phase where
you're in an environment that is
conducive to muscle growth physical or
mental until you reach a point of
feeling groggy and demotivated and then
in between either of these phases is a
maintenance phase which you choose to go
into to maintain the progress that
you've made over time to maintain the
muscle that you've built in business you
maintain Baseline Revenue in
relationships you maintain a baseline of
fulfillment and spirituality you
maintain a baseline of happiness you do
all of the above by creating a system
and pulling levers right so when you
self-reflect you've made progress by
everything that you've done and you have
a lot of knowledge an experience with it
now now you can reflect back and see
okay what are the things that I actually
have to be doing to make sure that I
sustained some level that I've built
myself into right because once you reach
a new high monthly revenue and business
you're usually not going to sustain that
for long you're going to hit a new
Baseline and then you'll hit a new high
and then new Baseline Rises and then new
high Baseline Rises and that's how it
goes but you have to bake things into
your day so that's literally my process
and the two hour writers the things that
keep my business going is writing two
hours in the morning focusing on my
brand and my content and then filling
that or sending that to products or
services and so most days when I'm not
working on extra things it's usually I
work two to three hours really that's my
lever moving task to maintain my current
level of income and then once you
prioritize that and add it to your
routine mine is like in the morning then
it just becomes systemized habitual and
almost effortless because you're not
expending so much mental energy on
something new known and it it just
happens it's second nature so I want to
end this with reminding you of the
supreme law nothing is permanent feeling
lost isn't permanent intense progress
isn't permanent even happiness isn't
permanent these phases of life will come
and go but you can trust that if you
seek to understand them year after year
you will get holistic results with time
if you grasp at any phase of existence
and attempt to make it permanent you
will experience chaos don't fight with
reality flow with it that is it for this
video again to our writer if you want to
learn a high value skill especially in
this digital Renaissance that I like to
call it or the new Golden Ages or
digital economics which is just the
master class on everything you'll ever
need to learn that's kind of my life's
work as of right now until the book
launches
um they're both part of my ever-evolving
life's work so hopefully you benefit
from those if you would like to check
them out but links to all that cool
stuff in the description like subscribe
I'll see you in next one peace
