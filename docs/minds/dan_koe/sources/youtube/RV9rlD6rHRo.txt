the best periods of my life always came
after a phase of getting absolutely fed
up with the lack of progress that I was
making and I've begun to understand the
difference between a relief and a cure
relief feels good and it comes in the
form of cheap Pleasures mindless
entertainment and prescriptions and by
prescriptions I mean things like
confident how-to advice and other things
like that like go to school get a job
retire at 65 pretty much step-by-step
game plans that are subjective and work
for the individual and must be created
by the individual and perceived as
guidelines and not law humans fear
change and so we cling to the illusion
of security that is presented by the
external world the advice the porn
Beyond sex the promises of a better life
the persuasive marketing angles the
things that may provide a sense of
security but are not of your own
understanding a cure is is painful and
it comes in the form of getting sick of
being sick to the point where you come
full circle and not the normal full
circle that everyone thinks of but by
full circle I mean a complete and
radical flip and perception so I want
you to imagine a line and this line has
a black to white gradient black on one
side white on the other with Shades of
Gray in the middle and now if we take
that line and we connect the ends where
black and white meet that is what I mean
by full circle and we can see this
pattern of reality in our everyday life
a person so stupid that they become
insightful an outfit so unstylish it
becomes stylish a joke so unfunny that
it becomes funny a non-believer so
trapped that they become a Believer or a
person so fed up with who they are they
become an entirely new person and so on
that note we have to understand who we
are why we do the things that we do and
the character that we are playing in
this world and the the pivotal moment in
which we can change that character
identity restricts perspective your
identity provides a boundary so that
your thoughts don't fall into unknown
territory and threaten your entire
existence perspective influences
perception because any given situation
has a certain amount of information that
can be perceived by you right the
conscious mind can process around 50
bits of information per second and so
when you go into a situation and you are
perceiving something from the goals
ideas and beliefs that you hold in your
mind you are only you're cherry picking
the information that you perceive and
you don't play a conscious role in this
99 of the time so the Identity or
character that you have created or that
has been projected on you over time your
conditioning your programming your
automatic thought processes and
perceptions limit the information that
you process within a situation because
your perspective only allows you to
see what you want to see and from that
information you will perceive the
situation differently from everyone else
so to illustrate this I want you to
think of a bird and so if you think of a
bird an image pops into your mind what
image is that right some people will see
a cardinal some people will see a blue
jay some will see an eagle some will see
a vulture some will see maybe even a
duck the image that pops into your head
will be completely different from every
single other human being on this planet
especially from culture to culture and
the same is true for something like the
concept of God which is extremely touchy
but you can pick apart and understand
and zoom out and not allow your mind to
judge anything that I'm saying here from
your prior conditioning or
indoctrination to certain ideologies and
you can notice that everyone is saying
the exact same thing and simply because
the concept or the word isn't the same
as what you've believed it to be the
entire time you are holding an image in
your mind of what that thing is some
people believe it's a man in the sky
some people believe it's the underlying
fabric of reality that can't be seen and
it's the same thing with a bird where
everyone holds a different image but if
you strip away the concepts if you let
the lines blur a bit you can see the
essence of what a bird is and then with
that everyone can be on the same page of
what it is that is why
opening your mind or expanding your
perspective or even practicing empathy
for other people or transferring your
Consciousness into other people to see
from their perspective is so valuable
because then you can pull truths from
that perspective integrate it into your
own which is what I like to do but I'm
nowhere near perfect at this right but
this even reflects across business where
some people get so tied to all the best
business model or this is the best way
to make money this is the best skill to
learn and it's like you just have to
view what successful people are doing
from each perspective and note the
patterns in the middle and for from
there you can make much better decisions
in what you learn what you do and the
way that your business operates and So
speaking of something as touchy as God
we can tie in the example of Christ
Consciousness which is also a concept
but it points at how Jesus Christ had a
higher level of Consciousness if not in
extremely high level of Consciousness to
that of the universe or God because the
identity right we're tying in identity
here his identity was not attached to
anything right this is what the
spiritual Masters are getting at where
he was not attached to anything so his
perspective was not limited he was able
to expand his perspective to that of
everything and see situations for what
they are and I'm not here to lecture you
on religion ideology or Dogma because
that is the exact opposite of what I'm
pointing at here I'm pointing at first
order being not second order knowing
right being is the landscape of
everything knowing emerges from that and
with that you cannot
fold one under the other you can't fold
knowing under being it is impossible to
know because it can't be put into words
because it came from words or words came
from it and so since we're taught we're
talking about something so touchy I just
want to make it very clear or at least
challenge you to look inward if you
noticed or became aware of certain if
you felt threatened when I said
something relating to anything I've I
understand the mind of the atheist I
understand the mind I was raised the
Mormon I understand the mind of many
different perspectives because I've
sought to understand them I sought to
challenge my own beliefs I sought to
prove myself wrong even when I thought I
was the most right person in the world
and the meaningful dopamine that you
reap from this pattern recognition
across different perspectives is a sign
that you're moving in the right
direction it just feels good to expand
your mind in a non-pleasurable way
perception influences how you move
within the world people that are heavily
tied to a religious nutrition business
or political ideology will almost always
act in alignment with the goals that
were assigned to them by that
intellectual construct people that seek
truth or seek to open their mind to
awareness Consciousness and
understanding are able to make much more
conducive decisions towards their ideal
future because action is directed toward
a goal always even even the minor things
literally everything always action if
I'm moving my hand like this that is
still the goal of me trying to get
something across to you and your
identity has goals baked into it because
your identity is required to navigate
the world and move within the world it
determines what you actually do and so a
political ideologue will adopt the
beliefs of their parents without
question and will act towards the goals
that were assigned to them by that
political party you see this all the
time like during election season where
everyone's just they become new people
right they kind of join in on literally
anything that the political party that
they subscribe to is saying even if they
wouldn't usually believe that or you
present it from to them from a
non-political perspective and they agree
with you but when it becomes a political
perspective they get all up in arms and
threatened in their ego and identity is
at stake they feel like they're gonna
die because that's what death is it's
conceptual and the same thing goes for
like religion where I remember writing a
letter by a newsletter right about God
and so I try to get across a perspective
and
what's interesting is that I I talk
about it in every single video every
single every single newsletter and
simply because it is not framed under
that religious lens people start sending
me emails about oh you didn't provide
proof you didn't do this like it's just
the basic regurgitated things that they
see online and then start spitting off
because they're unconscious they're
mindless they're robots and so to paint
a better more tangible less offensive
for some reason perspective a
bodybuilder by Passion and self-study
will generate their own goals that allow
their nutrition training and lifestyle
to fall in alignment with those goals
that they generated or else if they if
their actions aren't in alignment with
that goal because their goal composes
their identity anything they do outside
of that goal will lead to suffering
which is not bad but it is a useful
Compass towards better so character
creates action and action reinforces
character so if you want to change who
you are you have to challenge your
beliefs adopt new goals self-generated
not assigned to you and self-reflect
with time and by time I don't mean a day
or a week or a month I mean a lifetime
that's it's this is life and by doing so
you create a life of less involuntary
pain so if we want a different
perspective of God or whatever I was
talking about earlier let's use the term
life or story because story is symbolic
of universe patterns and UNI verse one
song universe that's what we're in just
this harmony in the present moment of
happening and you can note these
patterns in architecture music all of
creation scripture systems environment
economics and your life this is how we
make sense of the world because the mind
interprets the world through Concepts
stories metaphors and symbols and to
understand one thing we must have an
understanding of everything that is
connected to it in the relative world to
make sense of
the distinguished nature of reality
because a cup wouldn't make sense
without a hand gravity wouldn't make
sense without force or mass your life
wouldn't make sense without the current
state of society and culture everything
you know is just a layer of stories
containing billions of bits of on off
information pieced together for your
current level of understanding stories
give meaning to life and your identity
is the story that you tell yourself and
you will live out that story on
autopilot if not made conscious what
word sentence paragraph section and
chapter is unfolding before you in the
book that is your life and so now we
have to bring in the topic of polarity
to deepen our understanding of just
meaning in general in short one thing
cannot exist without the other happiness
cannot exist without a sad reference
point nor a cup without a hand or life
without suffering and on that last point
the climax of a story is the most
interesting or the most memorable or the
most meaningful when the battle is at
its peak when you aren't sure what the
future holds when the symbol villain is
just about to win but the hero triumphs
if there were no low points in your life
it would lose all meaning it would
become flat dull linear lifeless
mechanical robotic mindless mediocre
life is a dance between Order and Chaos
yin and yang push and pull masculine and
feminine and this reflects across all
planes of existence from personal to
social to cultural to Cosmic to
Universal with a capital u you cannot
achieve New Heights perspectives or
levels of consciousness if you never
accept the battle lose your ground and
Propel in a New Direction so now we have
this big picture understanding of what's
going on why we act and what kind of
suffering that could lead to and in
general you can see this across the
state of the world that people are just
not happy and so when you reach this
climax of the inner mental battle which
is a low point in your life that is
supposed to be there it is a natural
part of life we can leverage that point
in time by understanding emotional
transmutation transmutation is the
action of changing or the state of being
changed into another form so I have a
tattoo on my right arm
it's in oroboros or a symbol for Alchemy
it's an image of a snake eating its own
tail in the shape of an infinity sign
and it's a reminder to me that creation
demands destruction and one cannot exist
without the other or that progress
demands sacrifice I like to think of it
as a hot air balloon floating up in the
air and it has a bunch of bags hanging
down from it on strings and you can
either you can either go down because
you have too many attachments or you can
go up by letting go of those attachments
right but that demand sacrifice that
demands change and so this points to the
Law of Equivalent Exchange which states
that for anything you receive something
must be given of equal or greater value
so many of you have heard of alchemy and
transmutation and other things and some
people may perceive it from a literal
sense of like the old times where
they're turning dirt into gold in some
kind of magic but it's the same thing
with the concept of God where these
people are interpreting it literally
when all understanding is is
metaphorical it's all symbolic right
turning dirt into gold clearly isn't a
real thing but metaphorically you can
turn dirt or a low point in your life
into gold something better right
understand these things metaphorically
stop being so narrow-minded and stressed
and trying to disprove how everything is
literal and wrong because it just
doesn't happen in reality we that's
obvious and so an example of this is
using something like anger or being mad
and channeling that towards something
good or a goal and the way I like to
think of it is when you're in this low
point it is so much easier to become
directly conscious of that which you
don't want in life your anti-vision the
things that you just do not want that's
more readily accessible than oh like
yeah I want this life of a billionaire
even though I haven't experienced it
you're directly experiencing everything
about that negative low point in your
life and that alone gives you direction
right it gives you Direction in the
opposite way and you're tapped into this
very potent negative emotional state
that you can take and use and leverage
towards your goals that you set from
that anti-vision in the opposite
direction and so this can become
dangerous very fast and I want to make
it clear that we want to use our
emotions we do not want to be used by
them we do not want to be unconscious
slaves to our state of mind we want to
catch feel and direct our negative
emotions like a mental Tai Chi Master we
want to use not be used to create a
better life for yourself emotional
energy is the fuel and intentional
effort is the vessel and intention means
goal directed action what are you
stretching towards that is greater than
you and so now it's like okay what do I
Channel it into a goal okay cool what
what goal right so we need to channel it
into building that's how you achieve a
goal is by building something and the
philosophy of building is like that of a
house right you don't just start
building a house well you can do this
and this is a great way to actually
learn right you just go into it you
start building a house and then it sucks
the first time it's like okay let's
build another house and then it gets
better and that's how you actually learn
how to build a house that you can pass
down to other and others and it gets
better and better over time until it's
strategic and then you don't have to go
through the trial and error yourself
that's what evolution is is by solving
certain problems so that they become
easier to solve and so if you want to
build a house now in whatever
metaphorical domain you want to go into
like building a business or getting into
a relationship there is plenty of good
advice that you can study and start to
practice by building something of your
own and so this is the thing about
becoming conscious of the low point that
you are in right because if you have if
you hit let's say a financial low Point
like that's the problem in your life
because it's not everyone's not in the
same low point it feels the same but
it's all a different situation so you
have to become aware of that situation
it's like oh I'm broke I never want to
be broke again in my life I absolutely
hate this and I know that there is
better and so you set a goal maybe it's
time to get a better job or acquire
skills so that you can get a higher
paying job or start to build a business
and test with those things and all of
this is going to get time maybe you go
back to college but throughout this
entire time you still have to remain
conscious because you're gonna hit new
low points and you have to be aware of
what's going on there so that you
register it actually as a problem it
doesn't just go under the rug and then
you can correct your actions over time
so that you aren't stuck let's say going
to college and getting fed into the
societal machine but at the same time
you're also not starting a business
model for the sake of freedom and then
building yourself into a new nine to
five right you can pivot along the way
throughout all of this because most
successful people that I know started
their Journey out of raw hatred for the
situation they were in whether it be
they hated their commute to work or they
hated wearing a monkey suit five days a
week or they hated that they let a
relationship carry on or that they
weren't good enough for the one that
that they wanted to keep right this is
why
like 80 of young people get in the gym
because it's like I wasn't good enough
in this relationship why did it break
off I'm gonna go get jacked and I've
talked about this before but I know
young dudes will resonate with that very
superficial problem but it's just a
phase of life that you go through and so
when these people felt into that low
point in their life and let go of their
attachment to it and realize that there
is a way out and that they were able to
find a light that they can work towards
that's it a new potential revealed
itself and action started to become
frictionless just because they had so
pent up emotion that they could go
towards it another thing here is that
most people think that hate or negative
emotions should just be repressed or
forgotten or that they shouldn't exist
but what they don't realize is polarity
hate is the opposing end of love and you
wouldn't understand love without hate
but at the same time hate is the
obstruction of love and by removing it
or letting go of it love starts to
reveal itself and this is the same for
multiple different emotions and just
things and life and so now we're getting
into my philosophy here this is not a
static philosophy this is not something
that you have to do this is just what I
know my personal experience and maybe
you'll benefit from it I believe that
holistic entrepreneurship is the meta
vessel for any man or woman balancing
the chaos in their life with the
masculine pursuit of self-generated
goal-oriented building and so if that
makes little sense because that's me
trying to encapsulate a book's worth of
information in one sentence let me
explain the entrepreneurial landscape to
you right now first everyone is an
entrepreneur centuries ago individuals
fulfilled a purpose within their triber
Community they acquired skills or
interests that fit the quote-unquote
marketplace that was their Community
number two is that social media is not
just an app it's a new Society people
still don't realize how revolutionary
social media was it's where we learn our
school it's where we hire for careers
it's where we teach for business it's
where we meet socially we live in the
virtual world right here and now it's
integrated into our lives and like
things like virtual reality people are
like oh we're going to be in this whole
virtual thing we're already in it and
neglecting social media for what it is
and becoming a Mindless consumer of it
is like the scene in the Wall E movie
where people are just in their armchairs
brainless like just watching like being
fed all this cheap pleasure and so once
you break out of that and you're like oh
like I can actually help and leverage
this to contribute to a better life and
help break people out of that in short
by neglecting social media you are
neglecting The evolutionary path to your
fullest potential because social media
actually becoming integrated into our
lives is a sign and it is obvious that
it is a stepping stone towards the next
phase of human evolution and higher
potential for us number three is that we
have problem solved our way into doing
what you love we talked about this but
evolution is the process of solving
problems from small to large so that
those problems become less stressful
full they don't require as much Manpower
and we can leverage our time to do the
things that we enjoy over time and we
don't notice this until we reflect on a
decade-long time scale to see what's
actually happened in innate human Drive
is to pursue your curiosity and embrace
being and you can't do that without
money to a point but a hard point in
this Society therefore it becomes one's
life's work to leverage modern
technology to make an income doing what
they enjoy and you do this by pairing
your personal interest the things that
you enjoy studying your Curiosities the
other things that are just innately
valuable to your life you pair those
with social media and the umbrella
skills under that that are also just
psychology based in general which is
writing speaking marketing and sales and
you Channel your personal interest
through those online and are able to
eventually create an income for yourself
I talk about that in the one million
dollar skill Stack video so number four
is that you are the most profitable
Niche what is the mean meaning of life
that that's an incredibly loaded
question but I believe the answer that
makes the most sense is to raise the
collective Consciousness to help others
solve their problems or help them heal
or whatever lens you want to frame that
under so that we can transcend The
Superficial and be and live in
accordance with what is and if you say
if you hear me say live in accordance
with what is or live in accordance with
nature or reality or God and you've read
the book meditations by Marcus Aurelius
you're kind of seeing what I'm getting
at here where this has been talked about
for Time and Time and Time and Time
forever it's an idea that's lived on
because it's important the problems in
your life and everyone else's life are
mental physical spiritual and financial
those are the problems that we must
individually solve for Collective growth
the individual has to take it on
themselves to actually act on the
information that is given to them and it
is your job to pass down the information
from your personal experience so that
everyone can do that better and perceive
it from the lens that they learn the
best from we as Humanity are only as
strong as our weakest link and that
weakest link is mediocre mindless and
destructive hence why you must learn
marketing and persuasion for the sake of
awareness you don't push your world view
you simply illustrate it and let it do
its thing marketing persuasion and the
other things that do cause some like
alarms to go off in some people's heads
usually the unethical people that say
it's unethical it's a reflection of who
they are because they would abuse
marketing and persuasion we have to
understand what marketing persuasion is
it's applied psychology to
value exchange or business and what it
helps you do is articulate your ideas in
the way that makes the most sense to
other people so it catches their
attention right if it doesn't make sense
if it's not a good idea then someone
doesn't read over it then it's a useless
idea right you have to learn to
articulate your ideas in a way that
illustrates them holistically and allows
people to be like oh okay this is
actually a real problem in my life I
need to change it now and then they do
that from an individual level and the
more people that do that then it
combines until Collective Evolution in
other words feed the hungry which is
from scripture and those that are full
will eventually grow hungry you see what
I'm saying here I still understand the
literal interpretation mine where like
feed the hungry when they were saying
that in whatever Doctrine you're reading
it's it's not like a literal feed the
hungry sure that's still symbolic and
metaphorical for teaching people that
want to be taught and not trying to
force it on someone else and so when you
solve your own problems in your life but
through self-education skill acquisition
and building a business then it implies
that you have a solution that you can
pass down and so the solutions are both
how you gain a readership on social
media to build leverage and also create
a product from that solution that you
can sell on the marketplace like when I
fixed my productivity problems through
self-education and practice I created a
planner that I could sell it's that
simple and if you don't know where to
start all of this with writing and all
of that stuff and building leverage
check out my course to our writer I feel
like it's one of the most holistic
courses out there that provides you with
a non-dogmatic way of going about the
future of work and brand growth so the
last one number five is that a
quote-unquote Creator is not a job but a
new way of life regardless of your
beliefs in a higher power underlying
metaphysical Fabric or any
interpretation of a creator with a
Capital C it's hard to deny that the
active creation is pure ecstasy and
that's a sign to do it more often when
you learn dissect reconnect and teach
you Flex the creative ability of your
mind and in the wise words of Arnold to
me the pump kind of feels like having
sex with a beautiful woman and coming
you know it just feels fantastic I'm
coming all the time creativity is mental
bodybuilding creation is spiritual sex
and as with everything we can bring back
the image of the bird later we're going
into touchy territory here again but we
bring back the image of the bird and how
everyone perceives that differently
based on their prior experience
and orgasm is the same thing where that
can happen on multiple planes of
existence and the spiritual plane is one
of them right the the essence or what an
orgasm is the as in experience can be
experienced on the spiritual plane
through writing creation and passing
along your ideas in a way that impacts
others and if everyone leans into their
nature as a Creator then saturation
ceases to exist your story or identity
that you display in the Creator's
Society is nowhere near the same as
anyone else's even if you are pursuing
the same high-level goals like making
more money you can process 128 billion
bits of conscious information within
your lifetime you process that through
attention the information that you
perceive and are open-minded enough to
perceive that is your potential at any
given moment you are either wasting that
potential through distraction and a lack
of conscious perception or you're using
it to craft a conscious character by
which you can navigate reality and
contribute to humanity feel into the
situation that you are in transmute that
energy toward a goal acquire the skills
necessary to reach that goal pursue your
curiosity to avoid the mechanical nature
of prescriptions exchange your knowledge
projects and Solutions in exchange for
attention and income use your
self-reflective Consciousness to
identify gaps in your ability and fix
them you have the resources right in
front of you it will take time years you
may not start now and that's fine
because awareness takes time to Blossom
at least you're aware of it you're
further ahead than 99 of the population
because that's the other thing is that
this video may not it may not have made
any sense to your current level of
awareness but I've planted multiple
ideas into your mind that act as seeds
that will grow when you start to pattern
recognize or make connections in your
everyday life to what I said come back
to this in a year and you will see what
I'm saying if you stay on the path
because that's the other thing is that
these videos are not hyper practical
they're not prescriptions they're not
giving you that quick dopamine fix and
leading to you not making any progress
in this world this is going to sit in
your head and slowly influence your
actions towards something better and
that will only compound and once you are
able to create your own prescription
even better that's when you see results
so push forward in reality based on your
experience level seek big picture
understanding and don't get trapped in
the technical details and lastly enjoy
the rest of your week like subscribe
links in the description for to our
writer how to build a readership with
creative writing online that you can
eventually
make an income from and digital
economics which is a larger master class
on turning yourself into a modern
business and joining in on the Creator
society as I like to coin it so with
that thank you again for watching I'll
see you in the next one peace
