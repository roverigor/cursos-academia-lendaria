question how many times have people told
you to be yourself and seriously how
annoying has that advice gotten want to
start writing just be yourself want to
start a personal brand want to start
posting anything online just be yourself
want to approach a girl and land a hot
date just just be yourself bro it's good
advice but not to the masses because
they don't truly understand what it
means to be yourself why because they
are somebody else and they are viewing
the world through that lens not the lens
that they created they went to school
and unconsciously adopted bad habits
personality traits and an outlook on the
world that made them realize what's
possible for them in their life which is
usually not very much they went to
college with a fresh start but went
through another round of conditioning
just layering over what was already
there they got a job and accepted the
company's goals as their own and created
an identity around the job title that
they were given and that unconscious
misalignment leads to dread Despair and
the death of a soul that leaves a
robotic animalistic corpse of a human
being that lives in a Perpetual state of
survival a slave to the external world
when the external aligns with the
internal that is when your goals the
ones that you create align with who you
really are deep down that's when the
unconscious sends resources to help fuel
that lifestyle that you are trying to
build that is when the unconscious which
can manage 11 billion bits of
information compared to the conscious
mind which can only handle 40 to 50 like
me moving my hand this is unconscious
everything
that I'm doing my breathing my sight
everything mostly everything is
unconscious the things that we forget or
glance over as human beings that if we
came to know these things and explore
these things we would unlock or peek
into an entirely new way of viewing the
world so think about that if you can put
40 to 50 bits of information like using
conscious effort towards something
imagine 11 of the potential of 11
million more being available to you if
you can align the goal that you create
with what you truly enjoy or what aligns
with you the most or what speaks to you
the most if you want to
frame it that way there are many
different ways of framing this but I
find the best way to frame it is just to
have an open mind towards the the
spiritual way of saying these things and
not writing it off as like hippie or or
new age or any of that stuff right the
only way you're going to be able to
connect that to a way that you truly
understand is by having an open mind to
everything not only that I'm saying but
what everyone's saying now in previous
videos and quite a bit of the videos we
talked about how manual labor
and time not being scalable and certain
robotic specialized tasks being
automated out
all over the place it's just happening
that's what humans do we build solutions
to repetitive tasks that make sense to
build systems that do it for us and so
the future belong or the future belongs
to everyone of course but the future a
good future a lucrative future a good
external world for us belongs to the
people that can harness the creative
power of their mind but that's just the
thing is that if you try to leverage
your mind and especially a mind that was
created by the external World a mind and
thoughts and beliefs and a matrix next
video we're talking about the Matrix but
if you're trying to leverage a mind that
was created by the external world then
you are going to be thinking and
creating the same things as everyone
else you have to dig deep you have to go
inward in order to tap into that
infinite intelligence that is
because we want originality personality
and wisdom now originality doesn't come
from accepting what everyone has told
you taking the advice of others and not
having a shred of self-reliance we want
to have the Visionary ideas which come
from
intrinsic goals that pursuing the things
that you really want creating a vision
out of that and leading other people
towards it this is why I'm so big on
again the one-person business model the
Creator business model because it's
self-reliance based it forces you to be
original if you want to thrive in the
market it sets you up for the future by
building digital leverage and spreading
your ideas across the nation which
nobody could do prior to the internet
which is insane only the like most
profound possibly there are probably
more profound people than uh we know
right now like Socrates Plato all these
other people their their Works lived on
and now they're viewed as mythological
because in their time it would have been
like me talking to you whatever lingo or
vernacular that I'm using to speak like
this like it would just be weird if I
was speaking like in like an ancient
stoic right it wouldn't work but in that
time period it was normal for them to
speak like that and now we deem it also
profound and mythological and don't get
me wrong they're extremely profound and
there are insanely good lessons in there
that's why we love them so much but to
think that you aren't capable of doing
the same just by speaking your truth or
trying to actually create something of
value to put out to the world and impact
people's lives then
don't know what to tell you in a world
where there are no eyes the sun would
not be light and in a world where there
were no soft skins rocks would not be
hard nor in a world where there were no
muscles would they be heavy existence is
relationship and you are smack in the
middle of it Alan Watts
in a world where there are no others the
self would not exist your identity or
the self can only exist when you make a
distinction between you and everything
around you that's what the ego does
that's what the Mind does is it creates
boundaries it creates partitions in a
hard drive it creates distinctions from
everything so here's a graphic right who
you really are who you really are is
this little thing in the middle and then
the first ring on the outside is who you
think you are so that is a web of
thoughts and beliefs of your own about
yourself and then the next layer over
who you actually are it's who your
friends think you are and you probably
give that too much conscious thought
it's comparison right it's that
distinction that is what creates the
boundary between someone else and us
it's rather than it's not connection
it's comparison when it should be the
opposite it should be sameness over
difference but understanding the
differences between things is also a
good thing but that's as the Alan Watts
quote goes we shouldn't leave out the
similarities of things we need to hold
both in our mind in order to understand
them as a whole and so the ring outside
of that one is who Society wants you to
be and then even further outside of that
is who culture says you are so this is
what a lot of spiritual teachers and
Mystics are trying to say and especially
Buddhism with suffering right suffering
is the main word suffering is what we
are trying to not necessarily eliminate
but
view in a different light so suffering
happens when you view the world from a
lens of comparison you highlight the
differences between things and why they
are so different why they're not the
same what differentiates you a let's say
Christian from them let's say Catholic
and do you is there something there is
there tension there that causes dislike
or suffering in you because they aren't
willing to transition over to you and we
could talk about this from a billion
different examples religion is just one
of them so that's when suffering happens
but enjoyment that's kind of my word for
love because I feel like people get
confused with the word love because it's
been twisted and manipulated so much in
our language so I prefer the word
enjoyment and the feelings that come
from doing the things that you are
connected with right that's the thing
here not comparison connection is what
leads to enjoyment when you understand
it when you have Clarity on what you're
doing when you're playing a game and you
understand every single aspect of it
right your skill matches the challenge
that this game presents and it's just so
enjoyable that you become obsessed with
it so enjoyment and obsession is kind of
my word for what the spiritual teachers
or the mystics would call love so
enjoyment is what happens when you view
the world from a lens of connection when
you zoom out when you gain meta
perspective and you seek to understand
the big picture with an open mind rather
than a closed mind because your
comparison so I want to bring up a
concept that we talked about in a
previous video and it's called the focus
Matrix so at the top there's contraction
and I want you to think of this as
narrow Focus or deep focus at the bottom
there's expansion which would be wide
Focus or open focus and then on the
right there's conscious Focus which is
you're aware you're conscious of what
you're focusing on and then there's
unconscious where your attention is kind
of being manhandled like you're not
really
in control of it and you can see the
emotions and other things that are
associated with those so when you are so
zoomed in on something which isn't a bad
thing it's very useful in many cases for
say productivity but you when you're say
lasered in or narrowed in or contracted
on a specific thought or emotion that
you don't like or a belief then your
mind is closed off right because if
you're so focused on that something else
isn't going to register in your
awareness the big picture the other
piece of the puzzle that would not that
would lead you to not being angry you
can't become aware of that because
you're so lasered in on something
but when you zoom out and you try you
seek with an open mind you open your
mind you expand expansion you expand
your focus and your Consciousness to
seek to understand rather than judge
seek to observe and discern rather than
judge and react and label and so most
people are in this Perpetual state of
narrow contracted focus and you can see
this everywhere it's like in a comment
section when someone note or yeah when
someone notices like a typo in a tweet
of mine and that's all they focus on
they miss the complete message lesson or
Essence of the post itself and they're
like didn't you mean there because I
spelled their wrong or something like
that and it's like you focus right
that's what I mean by Focus is expand
your focus or try to understand the
essence of what's being said in any
given situation or pull the lesson out
of any given situation rather than just
lasering in on the one thing you don't
like and making that at your reality
because because it composes the contents
of your Consciousness so it's your
reality then
why why do you want to live like that
you don't and it's unconscious refer
back to the focus Matrix where all on
the left side I guarantee that those are
emotions that you do not want to have
and it is as simple as learning to focus
but that goes 10 times deeper than you
think it actually does so what does all
of this have to do with being yourself
here's a tweet I wrote the other day
people love to say be yourself but tend
to forget that it took your entire life
to get to this point of not being
yourself it's going to take thousands of
hours to reprogram your mind to act from
a place of consistent authenticity key
word there is consistent you can be
authentic right now but if you haven't
reached that stage this is the
difference between states and stages as
states are temporary you can be creative
for like five minutes you can be
authentic for five minutes but then when
everything goes unconscious
you're back to the stage that you were
at the level and so if you slowly
develop yourself over time to have a
higher baseline or stage permanence of
authenticity creativity productivity
whatever it may be calmness then you can
start to Branch into higher States and
slowly move your Baseline up and so when
you move your Baseline authenticity up
by deconstructing and reprogramming your
brain down then that's when things start
to get really authentic and consistent
so by the time you're 18 and once you've
gone through the phase of learning
learning from your parents and then the
school system and then your job and
you're left with this brain that was
created by other people and the things
that you consciously picked up along the
way and if you weren't made aware that
you were going down a wrong mental path
and then you can go back and correct
that which is what this video is it's
for awareness it's not like I'm gonna
magically fix it all sudden it's
something you have to become aware of
and develop over years upon years
because it took you years to get to this
place of not being yourself and that's
just the thing or we're creatures of
habit that's what our mind does through
conditioning you can think of this as
repetition right like when you go to the
gym and you perform repetitions that is
conditioning so when something is
consistently exposed to your conscious
mind let's say like a religious teaching
right then you start to believe that it
becomes law and neural networks are
carved out in your brain like the Grand
Canyon with flowing water and over time
you have this just massive thing that is
going to be difficult to either bury
over or re-did you're not going to do
that to the Grand Canyon but you can do
it to your brain through repetition or
conditioning in the opposite direction
towards the character or person that you
want to create and be authentic with and
this problem is perpetuated by social
media because think about it if we're if
our brain brain is conditioned through
information that we we receive or
stimuli that we receive and throughout
our lives like let's say we didn't have
phones and we were only exposed to our
parents our friends our teachers people
we cross on the street maybe the news
media something like that but now social
media where we're checking our phone for
a
check your screen time right check your
own screen time for hours upon hours
throughout the day exposing ourselves to
all of these different ideas and
depending on how many you truly pay
attention to and digest and resonate
with and most people not even
questioning any of these and just
accepting them as law then you're even
further not yourself we're in in age
where it is 10 times easier to be
conditioned into this just negative
human being as a whole right this toxic
human being as a whole and you can see
this everywhere it's a huge problem but
maybe that's just because I'm on social
media right maybe that's just because
it's been conditioned into my brain that
the world is so I have some work
to do myself but the thing with this is
is that you can lock yourself into a
socialization chamber on social media
and socialization makes you stupid I
mean it's kind of obvious right you
don't want to avoid socialization but
you want to strike a balance and social
media in any capacity city is not a
balance right you need time for being
alone that's how you be yourself you
can't be yourself if you're consistently
exposed and Overexposed to other
people's opinions especially in the mass
amounts that social media creates
because I find it funny that you and I
whether you're an introvert or extrovert
would probably cringe at being locked in
a room with all of your friends for like
three days right we you want to see them
maybe two three times maybe even just
once a week right to hang out with your
friends for maybe an hour to three hours
at a time but then you don't cringe at
the fact that you log onto social media
where there's a hundred times more
people posting much more polarizing
information and just like you you act
like that's diff
right your mind doesn't know any
different it's the same information
maybe it's different in medium but not
even then maybe you're just in person
you can see the bottle in that case it's
just worse social media is worse all
like around and now I always get the
question when I talk bad about social
media it's like isn't your job to be on
social media I'm talking about the bad
aspects of social media right I know I'm
a influencer or I'm a Creator but I'm on
social media less than 30 minutes a day
all of my content is created outside of
social media I log on to engage with
people and get what I need and that's it
I'm very careful with curating who I
follow and that it's not for Mindless
consumption it's for inspiration and
research and I think a lot of people
could benefit from having that mindset
because the only other option is to
distract yourself right so log on social
media get what you need talk to the
people you have to network take
advantage of the benefits of social
media and the mass reach of it and then
leave the rest out you're not obligated
to do any of that and it's another thing
so I'll just address this right now if I
don't respond to DMS or sometimes
comments or other things one it's
because I have a community and that's
where I spend the most of my time so I
can help the people that want to be
helped the most but aside from that it's
like I wouldn't be able to create this
content if I was on social media more
than I am now I wouldn't be able to
deliver this kind of content and even if
it's not the most genius level content
it's like I like what I create and I
like to try and be original and I
wouldn't be able to do that if I was
just copying everyone else
unconsciously because they're just
feeding my brain with everything they
want me to say and so don't just blindly
follow like what I'm saying here as with
any of my videos I try to add this in
all of my videos is like you have to
test an experiment for yourself you have
to deem what I say true and if it's not
true to you then it's not true to you so
as you're going about this week try to
catch yourself being someone else notice
the words that you pick up and you're
like oh that's a new word that I said or
I haven't said that much before like
where did I pick it up question it and
follow it to its source and then see do
I really want to adopt this as a part of
my vocabulary or how I articulate things
and then also notice the decisions that
you make and whether those are
influenced by others or not online or
offline right if you're following
someone who is a great marketer and I
have nothing against this right the like
marketers are doing hopefully doing a
good thing by providing a product that
helps someone's life but if you're
following them and you're starting to
believe like okay this one person
business model that this guy Dan Co
promotes it sounds so amazing because of
how it's impacted his life
but are you going to start one just
because I said so or does it actually
resonate with the goals you want to
achieve in your life the intrinsic goals
that you have created for yourself and
does it sound like a worthy path to get
there you can't be yourself if you're
never alone with yourself and as with
everything this requires balance balance
does not mean split down the middle
balance means a conscious effort to
prevent either extreme from taking over
so if your goal is to make a dent on
this world if you're following me and
you want to become a value Creator you
want to start a one-person business you
want to be more original you want to be
more creative you want to create a life
that you love that you want to create
then you're going to have to expose
yourself to other people right that's
just inevitable for anyone really you're
gonna have to expose yourself to people
at some time because all of this
business stuff is transactional you need
another person to give you money in
exchange for Value right that's how it
works but balance you have to create
time for being alone you have to create
time for sitting and contemplating and
meditating over the ideas that you are
trying to put out to impact the world
because the problem with over
socialization is that your thoughts
writing ideas and work are not original
unique or novel and because of that
you're going to get the same results as
everyone else and if you know everyone
else they're in the rat race whether
it's a corporate rat race or a social
media one-person business Rat Race you
have to prioritize your mind you have to
prioritize self-development you have to
prioritize cognitive and creative
development and this is the thing that
will separate you from everyone else
don't worry about your Niche don't worry
about how well your Topic's performing
prioritize developing your mind so
what's the first step to being yourself
it is prioritizing yourself it's being
selfish selflessness requires selfish
values self-control self-reliance
self-reflection self-education
self-awareness self-employment
self-management self-experimentation I
could go on and on and on I'm reading a
tweet from my phone but you can go on
and on and on it's impossible to be
selfless when you are dependent on
others for your survival because I've
experienced this a lot there are a lot
of people in this world that
just want to be selfless out of the gate
they want to give value when they have a
creative value by prioritizing
themselves and of course this requires a
balance right now I'm not saying oh just
be selfish all the time be be a
and do all this selfish it's like
no no no no use your brain you can be
selfless and you can give some money to
a homeless person but even then question
yourself be a bit skeptical are you
giving that homeless person money
because you actually care about that
homeless person or are you doing it to
receive a good feeling now am I saying
that you shouldn't give a homeless
person money because of that no I'm just
saying to know your own motives and
become become conscious of your own
thought processes and not lie to
yourself so again we're touching on the
value of self-reliance you have to take
it on yourself to figure it out to
figure everything out in this life
because it's not like you know
automatically what you want for the
future you figure it out you figure it
out by trying stuff
you figure it out by doing you figure it
out by not getting distracted and making
reverse progress so don't Outsource your
health to convenience don't Outsource
your thinking to social media don't
Outsource your career to the school
system treat your life as a science
project the essence of science
the foundation the fundamental one law
of science is trial and error you have
to try everything and eliminate what
doesn't work you have to try different
exercises in the gym you have to try
different foods you have to try
different diets you have to see what
works refine back a bit cut and then
keep going and you eventually compound
this knowledge or experience to the
point of where it just you make it seem
effort effortless to other people so be
your own personal trainer be your own
therapist be your own business mentor
and so now in terms of being alone
because we know that being alone is
necessary for being yourself
what do you do when you're alone so the
first thing my favorite is you can go on
a contemplative walk and I used to hate
walks I used to hate going on a walk my
girlfriend ex-girlfriend at the time
would always want to go on a walk at
night then I'd be that pissy
 just sitting inside no I
don't want to go on a walk I'm going to
sit here and ruin everything no I'm just
kidding but the the point is is like I
would go on a walk and I'd hate every
second of it it's because I didn't have
y's stacked behind it I didn't like
going on a walk because I didn't
understand why it benefited my life I
wasn't selfish with why I was going on
walks and so now that I Incorporated it
one time like a few years ago I went
into a cut because I like to lift and
bulk and cut and sometimes happens and
so I was cutting down and it's like I
don't want to do cardio I'm just going
to start going on a walk start walking
10K steps a day and then I started
listening to audiobooks and then I
started noting down ideas and I started
writing my articles and I started
researching the benefits and trying to
condition myself to like going on a walk
and now if I walk less than 15K steps a
day I'll literally I won't go to bed if
I'm at like 10K steps at night before I
go to bed I'll get up and I'll go walk
and so on this walk what you can do is
one listen to an audiobook and like
munch on the ideas and mull over them
and pause it and think but you can also
contemplate your vision for the future
you can contemplate who you want to
become you can contemplate who you are
or who you think you are and so the
thing with this is is like contemplation
isn't easy being with yourself isn't
easy but struggle is where you're going
to receive the lesson the struggle is
where your mind is primed with tension
to be resolved by giving you a lesson of
that experience do you have an answer
for what you're contemplating right and
so it may take a week to figure out uh
who you are it may take a year to figure
out what you want for your future but
you're going to receive these mini
lessons along the way as you're going on
the walks and ideas are going to pop
into your head and that will attribute
to the progress that you are trying to
make towards the intrinsic goals that
you have set for yourself
on the journey to a better life so the
second one
to do when you're alone is weekly self
reflection you can do this in a journal
but self-reflection is pretty much just
questioning
what went wrong what went right uh what
did I learn what am I going to do better
did I do anything according to my goals
you can look up like sulfur
self-reflection questions to answer in
your journal or just to contemplate on a
walk because the thing is is that nobody
knows what they want in the future it's
literally impossible you can't know what
hasn't happened yet it's just a
potential it's just a possibility of
what's going to happen if you have a
Clear Vision for your future it's just
that it's just imagination it's just a
vision for your future that you're
trying to work towards and you will
never know what you want in the future
until you achieve it until you achieve
what you think you want or whatever you
had in your imagination or whatever goal
it was just to self-reflect and see okay
did I actually want that did I actually
make progress do I know what I want now
or do I have do I have what I want now
or do I need to set a new goal and
pursue that because you're never going
to know that's the thing is is that this
is an infinite game it's never going to
end this is why you need to fall in love
with the process is because how can you
fall in love with something that's just
an ideal or like
an imaginary Vision right it's good it's
a very good thing do not TR think it's a
bad thing I'm just saying you're never
going to know you have to continuously
set new goals and make continuous
progress because if you don't then the
other option in our modern world is to
get distracted and regress so number
three out of things to do when you're
alone to be alone is to write to clarify
your thoughts here's a part of a thread
from Jordan Peterson no one ever tells
students why they should write something
well why are they writing well you need
the grade it's like no you need to learn
to think because thinking makes you act
effectively in the world if you can
think and speak and write you are
absolutely deadly nothing can get in
your way so I've experienced this
firsthand and you do not experience it
until you start writing again this is
why I'm a proponent of writing online
and building a one-person business doing
so and even the Feynman technique equal
lines with this where the Feynman
technique is pretty much teach what you
learn and that is the most effective way
to learn that's how you're going to
retain 90 of the knowledge that goes
into your brain unlike taking notes
which is like you retain five percent of
it or something like that so you need to
write and learn to articulate your
thoughts like this so you can actually
make better decisions in the world and
open up your mind and be able to have
new ideas register in your awareness
because you can make sense of them and
again with the transactional nature of
business you have to be able to
articulate the value of yourself and
your product and your content to the
person on the receiving end that's how
you grow a following none of the tactics
and strategies called marketing or sales
or any of that stuff that is just a
layer over human nature and psychology
is going to change that for you you have
to learn to write and articulate your
thoughts templates and all of this other
 is not going to help you it'll get
you a bit of results at the beginning
but if you do not back that with a
foundation if you are not building the
house of your business on a solid
foundation of human understanding then
you're not going to make it the house is
going to fall if you don't have ideas
read if you have ideas but can't
articulate them right if you have ideas
and have the clarity to execute build so
number four of things to do for being
alone is to question the story that your
ego fabricates right because that's what
the ego does it tries to make sense of
the world through stories and so the
best way that I can explain this is as
you're scrolling social media or as
you're scrolling Twitter watch your mind
right you're going to read a 280
character tweet which is about this big
and
if you don't understand it you're going
to start filling in the blanks you're
going to start filling in okay it makes
sense if I apply it to this aspect of my
life or it doesn't make sense if I apply
it to this aspect and so since it
doesn't make sense in that aspect this
makes me angry and I feel like leaving
an angry comment right so I think it's
things like that rather than just seeing
things for what they are reading the
tweet for what it is seeing the post for
what it is seeing someone else for what
they are seeing what they say is what
they are and not filling in a past or
future of what you think they were or
what you think they're going to be
interact in the present moment but of
course this is done best done alone so
when you're scrolling social media or
you're reading a book watch your mind
observe it observe how it starts to fill
in pieces and manipulate the picture
that you are seeing to fit your world
view so that is it for this video I
truly appreciate you watching uh more
coming at you the next video is going to
be about the matrix it's going to be
very deep I hope you get a lot out of it
