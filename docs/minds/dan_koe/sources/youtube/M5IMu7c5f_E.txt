the one person business roadmap 99 of
creators make this mistake this is a
video in the series that we've been
doing on one person businesses business
eye and this one is meant to give
somewhat of a road map just along your
journey to know what to expect because
there's different stages which we'll
dive into but I I don't want other
people like looking at what other people
are doing in business and expecting that
they should do the same thing because a
100 000 follower account that's making a
billion million dollars a year is not
going to be anything doing anything
remotely similar to what you should be
doing at the beginning so to start this
off this video is sponsored by me
because digital economics you don't have
to enroll in it as a cohort anymore it
can be enrolled in as a self-paced
course now so it's not closed off till
February you can get in at any time and
so in a nutshell I'll let you explore if
you want to I'll save the promotion for
later but you can just go to the link in
the description click see what it's all
about but in short it's productizing
yourself everything we've been talking
about in this one person business series
it is systems for doing that with a
notion Command Center so templates to
just plug and play create your brand
write content systemize it create a
product create a service make it
profitable from the very start with xero
experience and how to promote and
automate promotion so you can just
consistently make sales so it's growing
your brand with content leading people
into your product or service and then
automating that or systemizing it to two
to four hours a day so you can continue
to grow and monetize with time so now
let's get back into it so if you're a
one person creator business or want to
be pay attention because I've been in
this game for three years now in the
Creator game right I did freelancing and
other stuff before that so I had a
little bit of a head start when I got
into the whole Creator scene now I've
seen accounts that are small and large
fall off the map I've also seen small
accounts making talking a hundred
thousand a month I've also seen huge
accounts with a ton of followers making
less than a thousand dollars a month and
most people see one or the other and
just think it's a bad thing I'm here to
tell you that you can do both you can
grow big and you can monetize because
like the classic saying is that like you
don't want to aim for followers or just
grow really fast and followers because
then you're not going to be able to
monetize because they're very generic
and then it's like if you understood
marketing to any extent you can raise
the awareness level of that audience to
the point of being a buyer and if you
stick at a low audience and you're in
that cycle of I need to reach out and do
manual labor or have some form of system
outside of what I've built in order to
land clients I don't see that as
sustainable right we want to continue to
grow and evolve to the point of where we
can control our time and income the
things that we work on and just have
complete control over our lives and our
businesses but still providing value and
doing what we're supposed to do as a
business but not getting trapped in one
specific stage so I'm here to tell you
that you can do both of the above grow
big if you have the skill it's a skill
it's not a luck or just like growing out
of nowhere it's a skill social media is
a skill and you can create an offer
ladder of valuable products and services
that allow you to pull in an income
preferably doing what you enjoy because
that's what your offer or product should
revolve around and decreasing the time
you spent on actually fulfilling that
product or service and so we do this
with something that most people just
skip over don't think about at all and
that is leverage in this case
specifically it's digital leverage so
I'll paint a picture of what I mean here
and it always sounds self-aggrandizing
like when I say it this way I but it's
just to paint a picture right so I have
500 000 plus followers across different
social media platforms YouTube is one of
my spot lists and with that like on
Instagram I can reach out to I have
multiple celebrities following me I can
reach out to almost anyone and get a
reply your average freelancer who wants
to work with these celebrities cannot do
that and that's part of what I'm saying
here is that if you had an audience and
didn't even sell through it or even talk
about let's say web design as your
freelance service I could get in front
of a celebrity and potentially persuade
them to purchase Web Design Services
from me just in the DMS alone I can also
promote a product or service to my
audience and have it reach 10x the
followers that I have because the
network effect right my promotions and
my content are not only reaching my
followers but their followers as well so
500 000 And if every single person had
like 500 followers that follow me then
multiply that or I have multiple people
with over a hundred thousand follower
audiences following me because that's
what creators do is just follow each
other and so I have a lot more potential
traffic than just those 500 000
followers that compounds and along with
that I can increase or decrease my
income as much as I want to depending on
how much I want to work what new
projects I'm working on if I want to
work on new projects
etc etc and just to like put a cherry on
top if I really wanted to I couldn't do
this before if I didn't have a lot of
followers and that's why I always find
it funny people telling you not to gain
a lot of followers if no one's saying
this you're probably not in the social
media circle of people saying this but
marketers on social media do say this so
if I really wanted to I could make fifty
thousand dollars in 24 hours and if I
really wanted to push it in like step
moral boundaries which I don't want to
do because it doesn't feel good I could
make a hundred thousand in 24 hours or
even more and on special occasions like
Black Friday when it's Justified I made
a hundred and thirty nine thousand
dollars in the course of three to four
days and I know screenshots can be
photoshopped and you may not believe it
but
I'm just putting it out there and so
before we dive further I have to preface
once again that this is for one person
creator businesses this is for people
that want to talk about their interests
build an income doing so not hire many
employees if any at all and unlock that
level of Freedom that you can that
technology has allowed the individual to
do for themselves so this is not for
Freelancers or it can be for Freelancers
if you want to build an audience but
overall the the main message I'm trying
to put out here is
if you have a goal of your own and this
video does not align with your goals
don't let flashy screenshots or other
things distract you from the goal you
can still watch it and gain awareness
but overall just keep that in mind the
internet enables 8 billion monopolies to
make things simple your brand as a
Creator or your personal brand is based
around what you want out of life the
thing that you are leading your
followers towards and everyone has the
same desires and those desires or those
problems or those goals all fall under
the Eternal markets this is a very
important concept for you to understand
the Eternal markets are health wealth
relationships and a bonus is happiness
so the first three of those health
wealth and relationships are survival
based their self-actualization based and
the last one happiness is
self-transcendence based and these
markets are where all burning problems
exist because that's
like survival problems are the most
burning problems that's what people are
trying to solve no matter which way
they're doing it if they're starting a
business it's because they're usually
trying to fix some part of their
survival if they're buying a nice car
it's because they're usually trying to
uh survive via status and so with these
markets that's how you create a
compelling angle for your marketing or
just products or brand or content in
general is by targeting these relevant
profitable and Evergreen markets but now
we don't just want a normal old personal
brand or Creator we want a personal
Monopoly like the naval quote said a
monopoly Irreplaceable is a good word
but how do we become Irreplaceable by
pursuing your genuine curiosity because
that's what makes you you and you are
the only you on this planet so if you
want a desaturated niche of one you are
the niche but the thing is is most
people can't pursue their curiosity at
least not consistently or full time why
because their attention is being
manhandled by their base psychological
needs self-actualization the the
hierarchy of needs that is a need not a
want for living the good life so
your future isn't about competition with
others it's about competition with your
distracted mind meaning an exceptional
future belongs to those who can Master
their survival pursue their genuine
curiosity and pass down what they
learned along the way so improve
yourself solve your own problems master
your survival document your journey
pursue your curiosity and separate
yourself from the crowd how you do this
is unique to you if this helps you
understand it more your story is your
brand right a story it has its highs and
lows it has problems that you overcome
over and over it's like an endless story
and as many marketers know stories are
what sell stories is just how humans
make sense of the world Transformations
with things like sales or the sales
process and you implying a
transformation that is a story when
you're writing copy or copywriting it
always starts with a lead which
illustrates a problem and agitates a
problem and then it shows you how to
overcome it and then it gives you like
testimonials on how to do so for proof
and it's just mark getting in sales are
just different tactics with a foundation
of human psychology that help you show
someone that they can transform and
preferably help them to transform that
is the right way of doing marketing and
sales there's of course like
exploitation and manipulation in this to
reach a non-mutual benefit and that's
what's labeled as a scam it's promising
a certain thing and not being able to
deliver on it so I'm just putting this
out there is that you have to be able to
deliver on something and if you can't
and you don't refund them that's a scam
so I always give this example of if I'm
pursuing Financial Freedom that's just
like a big broad goal my path to get
there is going to be completely
different from someone else's if I'm
going to learn a skill like web design
in order to do freelance to unlock
Financial Freedom while another person
goes to like a high-paying Tech job and
then starts investing and then
eventually retires those are completely
different paths they're completely
different stories with different
problems but it helps people reach the
same goal and that story is valuable to
the generation under you that's what
people want to follow along with right
that's why you watch a movie or read a
book is because of an interesting story
so if you can put yours out online while
still Distributing like actionable
advice and valuable information along
with it then you've cut you've created
your own personal Monopoly or mental
Monopoly is how I like to call it so why
is this important because that's what
we're here to do is self-actualize and
transcend you pass down your lessons and
you help others get there faster and so
if enough people do this just imagine
what kind of world we can create I I am
truly like maybe I'm delusional
who knows but I am like I feel like I'm
putting across a good message here of
one improve yourself help others improve
themselves with your prior experience
and both of you reap the benefits of
doing so right and so if enough people
self-actualize and transcend through
this method with business as their
vessel to do so then they open up more
people to the potential of creative
problem solving right using their minds
for something else rather than
themselves right selflessness after you
saw all of your selfish needs creativity
Innovation and Discovery through the
pursuit of curiosity are what will take
us into the next phase of evolution
whatever it may be build distribution
then build whatever you want
in life as Draco willing says discipline
equals freedom but in business
especially this one person business
distribution equals Freedom distribution
this is an important concept this is a
very important concept that again not
many people talk about right this falls
under digital leverage but everyone is
focused on like the generic social media
tactics distribution from the lens of a
Creator business is the potential
traffic that you have to send to a
product service or just like some
crevice of the internet or some internet
content or something and so there are
three types of distribution there is
built borrowed and bought so you build
distribution by growing on social media
right that's what social media is
nowadays it's a way to gather an
audience or a readership for the value
that you are providing and the more
people you have there you retain that
audience right but the next thing you
should do is de-platform them because
social media can go away at any time it
may not it may and especially if you're
polarizing in post like controversial
takes you could get canceled from the
platform and lose your entire audience
so de-platform them by sending them to
an email list because nobody can take
emails away from you or a community a
telegram Channel something like that and
continuously feed them into that and
deliver more value in depth in those
areas and so that is the most important
one is building distribution right
because you're not borrowing it or
paying for it it's kind of in your
control but the next one is borrowing
distribution and this is for things like
podcasts where you can get on someone
else's podcast and promote yourself and
your products you can pay for a podcast
sponsor that kind of falls under paid
but other things like you being
mentioned in someone's newsletter or you
doing a guest post on someone's blog or
just someone retweeting you and you
getting to borrow that traffic but at
the same time it's it's spilling over
into your own built traffic when you're
doing things like like you get retweeted
or shared on Instagram by a big account
and so the best way to do this is is we
talked about a personal Monopoly but the
next thing is the mental Monopoly which
I like to kind of frame as just having
great ideas that people tie to you right
we'll talk about this more but it's like
when you read your favorite book or when
I ask you what your favorite book is and
you say oh it's the Power of Now by
Eckhart Tolle and then you think of an
idea that you learn from that book that
you attribute to him that's what I mean
right when you put out consistently good
ideas that stick in people's heads when
they come across something in their life
that reminds you of of that idea they're
going to be reminded of you and that's
what makes you unique among the people
that are just putting out generic
content and quotes and so lastly you buy
distribution by like paying for ads like
Google Facebook Instagram
Etc you can also pay for shout outs but
these all like overlap right so you can
pay for shout outs from people to borrow
Their audience and have some of that
spill over into yours but overall out of
all three of those you should focus on
building your own distribution so here
is an image of my current distribution
Network right so at the top I like to
think of a brand as having three pillars
which is growth authenticity and
Authority so at the top with growth
Twitter Instagram LinkedIn those are my
top of funnel like growth that's how I
build distribution is with short form
content on the platforms where it's much
easier to control growth with things
like shares as opposed to authenticity
in the bottom right with podcasts
YouTube newsletter even like blog SEO
would fall under that that's where I
talk more and like give more actionable
advice but also work in some of my own
language because podcast YouTube SEO
they're much slower to grow and I prefer
to grow with Twitter Instagram LinkedIn
and then transfer those over to the
podcast YouTube or blog or newsletter
and then in the bottom left to build
Authority it's either for me it's a
course cohort and Community but for many
people I'm writing a book right now and
for others it can be more than that it's
just a product that allows people to buy
from you invest in you them get
something valuable in return and that
exchange be meaningful right people that
haven't started a business before
usually think like oh sales is bad and
they go and buy stuff every day that
they absolutely love right and so in the
middle of the graphic the brand revolves
around my interests expertise and
experience and these all overlap right
your income lifestyle and freedom are
limited by the amount of time your
products take to fulfill so with a
projected 62 percent of jobs being
threatened by Automation in the next
decade it makes sense that the highest
paid individuals will be the ones that
Leverage The Power of their mind the
creative ability knowledge and
experience in their mind right so in the
last one person business video I went
over how you have a hundred thousand
dollar product in your head AKA based on
your knowledge and experience so you can
go watch that one if you want to
understand building or creating a
product and so with this when you have
an absurd amount of distribute abusion
like traffic built but you have you only
have a service like a freelance service
or agency service or coaching service
that requires your time to fulfill and
not a digital product or you haven't
productized as you grow in order to free
up more time and be able to take on uh
more customers and you're going to have
a bad time so if you don't have a
product in place as you're growing that
will sell fulfill and maintain itself
while you sleep then an influx in
traffic let's say from someone
mentioning you on a podcast or you going
on someone's podcast and you having an
overabundance of potential clients or
customers and you not being able to
handle them or take them on there's I
mean it's a pretty wise decision by the
time you're growing and growing to Pivot
out of client work or hire someone else
on but since we are talking about this
from the lens of the one-person business
it's better to productize and just be
able to control your own time and so
another thing that people skip over is
that the more people you help the more
leverage you have right this is why I
think authors have so much more level
average than let's say like a two
hundred thousand dollar a month agency
is because there are D their ideas are
in more people's hands right they impact
more people and have more dedicated fans
to the point is and this isn't all about
money but if they were to go and sell
something like a coaching service they
could charge outrageously high prices if
they wanted to or they could just do
like an automated or have like a cohort
style thing and sell so much more than
the people that are doing the direct
Outreach left and right internet content
is idea Warfare on mental real estate
most one-person business beginners don't
see internet content for what it is it's
not about catching attention it's
important but it's not about catching
attention it's not about gaining the
most followers it's not about having the
most engagement it's about valuable
ideas valuable ideas equal relevant
understandable and actionable to the
point of being spread without personal
effort so the more perspective shifting
ideas that you put out into the world
the more mental real estate in the
collective psyche you are going occupy
like how an author and let's say The
Power of Now and how he kind of put
mindfulness on the map of a chunk of the
collective psyche and so if you want
help with these big ideas and other
things like that I talk about it all the
time and to our writer my writing course
uh it talks about like persuasive
writing and idea generation in the
Practical setting of building a social
media audience so the big problem with
all of this is that most creators are
encouraged to steal or swipe High
performing ideas and this isn't a bad
thing it's just overused because I do
this all the time I steal ideas from
high performing YouTube videos so I go
to a channel that I aspire to be like
and filter their videos by most popular
I go to medium and look at their
articles because mediums algorithm gives
you content based around your interests
you can get some incredible ideas just
by skimming the home page and then top
tweets so a twimax or tweet Hunter you
can filter any accounts tweets and see
what their highest performing topic is
people sleep on Twitter so much right
because a tweet a good tweet that went
viral is the perfect newsletter blog
YouTube headline right or just the start
of a newsletter or something like that
or something that can be incorporated in
there so there's more value in the
actual newsletter itself so with that
said we have to understand the evolution
of your journey because I do think that
it is very important that people start
with high performing topics and just
growing in general but as with
everything in life there are
developmental stages so so these stages
they have a certain set of opportunities
that are available to them that are in
alignment with their skills experience
and expertise a stage one Creator can't
send out an email and make fifty
thousand dollars on demand it's just not
going to happen nor can they DM anyone
and get a response right you have to put
in the Reps and slowly build Authority
and leverage over time to the point of
you having more opportunities available
to yourself and to preface these these
are all made up there can be different
stages there can be different aspects of
the stages this is just what I've
noticed and the most common patterns
that I see in the Creator business
because I've been doing it for a long
time I've been in contact with thousands
of other creators I know what their
struggles are I know what your struggles
are I'm going to help with that so stage
one creators or low leverage creators
this is where every single person starts
assuming that you don't have prior
business experience or just have a
strategy already laid out for you and as
I said earlier the people that get into
this first stage or at least start
understand that social media growth is a
skill it can be practiced it's not just
a matter of luck people grow on social
media every single day because they
understand what it takes to actually do
it so the first thing that you should
focus on as a beginner in your creator
journey is high performing content you
can't just start posting whatever you
feel like you can't just post something
because you feel like it's clever or
artsy you have to understand what
actually leads to growth and if you
aren't growing it's not the reader's
fault because you feel like they lack
understanding it's because you lack the
ability to make your message
understandable to them so the best way I
can explain this is to just Study High
performing content right go to your
favorite YouTube channel look at filter
their videos by most popular see which
ones did the best why did they do the
best question it study top tweets
actually immerse yourself in follow the
social media accounts that you aspire to
be like and look at their content see
which ones do better than others and use
tools like tweet hunter or twemx to
actually go in and look at their top
tweets all around and note common
patterns understand why they did well
and try to emulate that so the second
thing is to use content templates as
training wheels so almost every single
social media course that you'll take has
like templates to structure your writing
or your posts or your message so that
they get more engagement and so I do
this by just copy and pasting certain
tweets into like a note and then using
the structure of the Tweet as
a way to write other tweets so I use
this kind all the time because this was
a tweet that did really well for me at
the beginning and so I noted that down
and then started moving more in a better
direction as I realized what was doing
good so the Tweet is right here I can
read it but you can see that it has a
hook it has three bullet points to hold
and keep attention so it delivers value
as well by giving actionable advice and
then it starts to wrap everything up and
give a conclusion with a potential pain
point that people may face so the third
thing that you need to focus on is short
form growth and idea validation so
tweets reels tick tocks shorts Instagram
posts LinkedIn posts not long form
YouTube not long form podcasts not long
form newsletter yet or blogs because as
I said before top of funnel on Twitter
Instagram LinkedIn Tick Tock you can
control growth a lot more on Twitter you
can Network or pay to get retweets same
thing with Instagram with shares same
thing with LinkedIn with comments and
that's how you grow with YouTube and
other things it takes more time and you
want to attack those platforms with
validated ideas that come from Twitter
Instagram or LinkedIn so put out a bunch
of ideas on let's say Twitter because
you weren't penalized for posting
multiple times a day and then see which
ones do the best as you grow and network
with other people and actually try to
get eyes on your content and then take
your best ideas turn them into a
newsletter turn them into a YouTube
video or a blog or whatever you want to
grow on next and as I said before the
the way that I grew on Instagram and
Linkedin was I already had viral tweets
from growing on Twitter right so all I
had to do was screenshot those with the
social proof or the likes and retweets
on them put them on Instagram
go through some form of a growth
strategy or try to get my content shared
and I got 10 a lot more followers than
most people would get simply because the
idea was already validated people saw
that so what happens if you get trapped
in stage one well you end up as an
account with a lot of followers but zero
loyalty as most people warn against if
you disappear one day nobody's gonna ask
like hey where'd Dan go and usually they
get obsessed with engagement and just
never bother to create a product or
service so stage two creators or medium
leverage creators once you hit 10K
followers or so you should feel like you
have the social media growth game down
and that you can continue growing and
you don't have to wait until this point
to monetize I actually recommend not
waiting till this point to monetize but
this is where the real money will come
into play at 500 followers I had a 3K
month at 10 000 followers I had a 10K
month at 50 000 followers I had a 50k a
month at 200 000 followers I had a
scratch that it was a 200k month because
of Black Friday if this shocks you good
if it doesn't props hope hopefully it
breaks some people out of their limiting
money beliefs I need to get better at
writing tweets so it's just a Baseline
and it sounds pretty crazy but
the reason I put this out there is
because I thought one hundred thousand
dollars in one month was absolutely
insane it was Insanity right and this
was like two years ago but then I saw
someone doing the same exact thing that
I did making a hundred thousand dollars
a month and I know he was being honest
about it because I knew who he was and I
talked to him on a frequent basis and
knew that he was a trustworthy guy and
so that blew my mind and I was just like
I want to make 10K a month I'd be happy
with that and I would be and I was but
it's like I can push more and it's fun
to push more in business so the first
thing you should do in stage two and you
don't necessarily have to wait till
stage two to do this is to learn direct
response marketing direct response
marketing is the skill that made people
like Alex hormozzi Rich before they
started going all in on brand and giving
everything away for free and now I think
you should give everything away for free
but over time with your content over the
course of 12 12 24 36 months and you can
aggregate all of those points for
convenience into a product or service
that people can pay for for Speed that's
what people pay for is speed aggregation
convenience and so this is the same
story for someone like Justin Welsh who
many of you know we did a podcast
together but uh he did a similar thing
where you study books like cash
advertising there's a book you can go
study and then start learning on your
own go down a Google Rabbit Hole of
direct response marketing and
copywriting and and then you get results
with that but then you can start to feel
a bit like salesy right and so you start
to become self-aware of that and slowly
transition into a more authentic voice
while still maintaining the principles
of direct response marketing right
because a lot of people the principles
of human psychology are the same in how
to craft a compelling message that leads
to sales but the tactics for doing so in
the past like decade have been just kind
of like wonky with all these sales
funnels and countdown timers and you
know all that stuff that kind of at this
point would scream that it is a scam or
just less trustworthy even if it is
completely authentic so the second thing
to do in stage two is to build a high
ticket offer why because when you're at
10 000 ish followers you just don't have
a large enough audience to like sustain
a income for yourself with a digital
product or like a low ticket product
right so you're better off creating a
coaching consulting or freelancing
service and that you can work your way
up to charging
twenty five hundred to five thousand
dollars by stacking specific skills and
applying them to a problem in a specific
business right it's like being a plumber
but for a business it's finding a
problem because you understand their
business as a whole creating an offer
specifically for that reaching out
presenting the perfect solution to the
perfect person actually getting them
results and then boom you can take that
down the road watch my other video on
creating a product turn that system into
a product and you already have results
that you can use to sell that product
and by the time that you reach eighty
thousand hundred thousand followers or
stage three then you're in a very good
place to monetize from products alone or
just decrease the amount of time you
spend on client work and so in the first
one person business model video which
I'll link somewhere I talk about a
minimum viable offer so if you have no
idea where to start in terms of creating
a service or a high ticket service that
you can sell I would start there watch
that video watch the minimum viable
offer part and start by charging five
hundred two thousand dollars and then
slowly work your way up until you can
charge more and more and by that time
you'll know what to do right you only
need to get past a certain point before
you know like okay this is what I do
next to get more sales so between stage
two and stage three you have you should
have
um you should have enough time and skill
to get to the point of Landing four-ish
clients at 2500 a month so 10K a month
and that kind of matches what I said in
the Tweet earlier about making 10K a
month at 10 000 followers it's through
direct Outreach and certain strategies
to actually get people to sign up for a
high ticket service and by the way if
you aren't interested in digital
economics that has all of these
um you can also consider joining modern
Mastery for five bucks it has a lot of
Education based on marketing and sales
and direct response marketing but
digital economics is the more like
system based pretty much plug and play
and just stay consistent with it until
you're successful so the third thing you
do in stage two is to Branch into
long-form content so by now you know
exactly what kind tweets posts threads
do well for you you know your highest
performing topics so you want to take
these and start creating depth and
Authority behind them by turning them
into a newsletter fleshing them out
talking about your thoughts behind them
or turning them and then turning that
newsletter into YouTube video or podcast
and just getting used to giving more
value than like a little 280 character
tweet because this depth is what's going
to lead to more authentic sales right
you don't have to go you don't have to
stick in the direct response copywriting
where it's like lead them down a thread
immediately get them to click lead them
down the landing page immediately get
them to buy etc etc as a content creator
when you're building an audience it's
not like paid ads where you have to
retarget them over and over again
they're going to consistently see your
content over and over again and if
they're on your newsletter they're
you're going to raise them up the levels
of awareness in marketing to the point
of wanting to buy your product and it
doesn't have to be the first time around
if you just stick it out and pay
attention to what's going going right
and what's going wrong and doubling down
on what's going right then you'll do
well and so what happens if you get
trapped in this stage stage two is that
you pretty much build yourself into
another nine to five I see people all
the time hovering between 10 and 30 000
followers and they aren't doing anything
related to a product or growing more or
maintaining the growth that they built
up until that point by incorporating
High performing topics and they just get
trapped in a cycle of reach out to a
client I mean reach out to a prospect
get a client not be able not have enough
time to do anything else and just
continuously doing that living in a
state of constant stress because if
their client leaves they're down 2500
bucks a month but they don't have the
time to continuously build an audience
because they're just in the next phase
of trying to find that new client all
right so stage three creators the high
leverage Creator most people don't reach
this stage because it's impossible
without survival Mastery ego development
and multi-disciplinary study people get
locked into the focus on one thing
mindset which isn't bad at the beginning
by any means build them into the build
themselves into that high ticket client
cycle and don't per they don't pursue
complementary skills or interests that
will
make them an individual right it will
individualize them to the point of
reducing saturation in the market I
incorporate spirituality and philosophy
into my business videos and I guarantee
you that's why a lot of you watch this
that's why I Stand Out amongst other to
the people that actually like my content
so the first thing you do as a stage
three Creator is to productize build a
network and leverage the results you
have from the high ticket service that
you built by now you may have already
created a product because you've watched
my other video If so good work but if
you haven't at least by now you should
have some results with the service that
you've been offering the high ticket
service freelancing coaching Consulting
and you've iterated on that system or
just the curriculum or whatever it may
be
in that high ticket service to the point
of it getting results consistently and
you having results with it right you've
refined the system enough so that you
are confident into by productizing it
and putting it into a product and
accompanying it with a curriculum that
teaches people how to use it and then
Distributing that in a way that doesn't
require your time so my advice is take
your system and method for getting
results reposition it towards a broader
audience beginner level because you have
a huge audience you want to leverage
that use your results as initial social
proof to have a six figure plus launch
and then in terms of networking you
should have been networking this entire
time but you can network with bigger
players now right you can DM people with
a hundred thousand to a million
followers get on their good side let's
say I grew on Twitter and I have a
hundred thousand followers and I want to
grow on Instagram so I reach out to
someone on Instagram who has a hundred
thousand followers and I'll be like hey
I'll help you grow on Twitter if you
help me grow on Instagram with the
validated ideas that I have that's
exactly what I did and that's how I have
more Instagram followers than I do
Twitter followers now so the second
thing is to refine your ideas and
diversify so the graphic that we showed
earlier Illustrated that my distribution
Network or my brand had three key
pillars right growth authenticity and
Authority so here's another simplified
graphic if you want to screenshot this
just to keep it at the top of mind but
growth comes from short form content
Authority comes from product or service
results authenticity comes from long
form big idea synthesis and of course
these all overlap each other right don't
don't get narrow viewed into one of
those that I just listed they all
overlap it's just priority so in stage
one eighty percent more or less of your
content should be focused on growth in
stage two when you have a service that
you can offer you start to incorporate
more Authority or authenticity based
content and depth and long form with
like writing YouTube video podcast Etc
so in stage 3 it's time to double down
on your best ideas and use them to
diversify your audience across different
platforms so as I mentioned earlier
I grew very quickly on Instagram and
Linkedin by reaching out to Big accounts
on those platforms showing them I had
value with my following and time in the
game offering an exchange of services
shares or money to help me grow in the
most optimal way possible and I already
had content that performed well you see
I knew which ones led to the most
followers I took that content I put it
on the other platform and I used the
knowledge or help from that other person
to grow really fast on another platform
you don't have to start with Twitter but
I'm just telling you like how you can
start to do this and Branch out because
most people think it's just like money
money is how you do it no there's Social
Capital if I have a hundred thousand
followers that is extremely valuable to
someone else that is trying to either
promote to that audience or grow via
that audience then I can vet them and
see if my audience would actually enjoy
that and
exchange value so the third thing you do
as a stage three Creator is to
prioritize long form content so once you
reach a point of high followers and high
income it's time to reposition yourself
more towards a synthesizer right
developing those big ideas that stick in
people's heads or the mental Monopoly as
I put it earlier and you can do this at
the start as I said all of these are
just like guidelines or help you become
aware you can do this at the start but
this is where it becomes very important
for the future of your brand so you
don't become a commodity because people
are going to be copying you left and
right I see this all the time on Twitter
Instagram Etc I have something pop off
and then the next day I see like 10 of
the same posts with the same exact thing
that I said slightly different so it
can't be considered plagiarism but
they're not going to make it in the
future I promise you that because they
don't have the creative ability to
consistently come up with novel
perspectives so this is best done with
long form like newsletters YouTube
podcasts Etc and in short you pursue
what interests you you study the big
picture ideas of those interests right
not the Minor Details not the minor
nuances you study the big picture ideas
when you read a book what's the five
huge ideas that they wrote that entire
book around and then you sit with those
ideas you go on a walk you experience
life and with those you start to connect
the dots through experience and just
writing about them and taking note of
them and being able to connect them and
I'm building a software to help with
this I wish I had it ready so I could
promote it because it's going to be
 sick but stay tuned for the
software around content synthesis so the
third thing is note patterns based on
your experience connect the dots with
long form content create your own
versions of Concepts processes and
philosophies and what I mean by this is
if many of you know the Eisenhower
Matrix right so the Eisenhower Matrix is
a priority Matrix so it's things that
you should pay attention to things that
you should forget things that you should
delegate Etc so if I had something for
prioritizing my day and it made sense
and it was like a system then I could
name it my own right the Eisenhower
Matrix is just a random name with a
valuable idea or concept and with time
that has grown and people talk about it
all the time so if I had one that was
truly helpful for people and I
distribute it via my content or a book
and then other people start talking
about it that's a contagious idea and it
sticks in other people's heads and my
ideas and my brand grows without me
doing anything it's like a positive mind
virus and so lastly take pieces of that
long form content for your short form
content and this is where things get
really fun and fulfilling this is where
I I didn't come up with the concept of
one person business but I took it and I
gave it an entirely new meaning right
one person business just stood for like
people operating a business as one
person with the technology of the
internet but I turned it into the like
productize yourself self-monetization
turning you into the brand truly being a
one-person business and doing what you
love for living and actually being able
to back that with systems that get that
result and that's what makes me stand
out among other people that talk about
one person businesses and I've also
named processes some of you know them
from other videos like intelligent
imitation tactical stress the unknown
and other things like that and this
comes from applying my interests to my
expertise so spirituality philosophy
neuroscience and how that works with
online business marketing branding Etc
and I have enough exposure and
experience and awareness in all of those
domains because I'm not a specialist to
no common patterns and piece together
this uh long form content that is
difficult to replicate as to methods
there may be a million and then some but
principles are few the man who grasp
principles can successfully select his
own method so this entire letter was
based on principles to an extent but
mostly it was just my method of doing
things right so don't take it as law
question what I say and I don't mean in
like a in a way way where you just like
write everything out in the comments I
mean question what I say test it
experience it and if you come up with a
better solution create content about it
this is not the only way of doing
business clearly and so don't narrow in
on this and think that it's the only way
of doing business it's not the main
lesson from this entire video should be
what I always preach
never stop learning never stop building
never stop evolving don't get trapped in
one of the stages evolve distraction and
comfort are the only things that can get
in your way self-actualize self-monetize
and self transcend
that is the end of the video so to end
it again digital economics the master
class with all of my systems and a cool
little notion template to use for just
running your entire business is now open

digital economics so if you don't want
it digital economics is expensive so if
you don't want to buy digital economics
yet and want to learn how to write
content and start growing buy to our
writer because in one of the modules it
gives you an option to upgrade to
digital economics and and take off the
price of two hour writer and then the
last thing
