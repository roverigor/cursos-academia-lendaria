one of my favorite books is the way of
the superior man by david dada while
david has some transformative ideas on
modern masculinity and kind of the
misconceptions surrounding that and
a lot of other things to go along with
that i could i could go on tangents
about masculinity because i know some
people
have misperceptions of it they don't
understand what it actually is and then
i've had people in the comment sections
get offended
by talking about masculinity because
they think i'm saying male when i'm not
saying that i would encourage you to
read the way of the superior man if that
is your conception of what masculinity
is
but aside from that point the thing that
i like the most about david data the
author of that book is his writing it is
very unique it is very different he is
not just
talking the spiritual talk but he is
kind of writing the spiritual right or
he is connected you can kind of tell
that he is connected to
source or to infinity or to his deepest
purpose or whatever you want to call it
he is kind of channeling the divine uh
through his writing right it makes sense
but it doesn't make sense and this
reminds me of a book publisher called
called sounds true right where you've
read the things where it's like
the this makes sense
this sounds true
but i don't really get what it's saying
right it's not saying something that can
be interpreted to material reality he is
speaking his experience right and i see
this in his lectures or his talks all
the time where he's kind of doing these
movements and he's speaking in a way
that isn't directly
it can't be directly interpreted to
something
hyper pragmatic or hyper actionable like
everyone is chasing these days and just
clouding over or adding on to their
perceived reality and eventually it gets
so cluttered that they
don't know what to do and don't know
what's causing their suffering when
if you're into the spirituality stuff
you understand that layering
on top of reality is what causes the
suffering it's adding to your life
rather than subtracting and
being and this has taught me a lot about
my writing as well and when i write my
articles or my newsletters or even my
book which is kind of what this entire
video is about
is that when i sit down there are times
where there's no thought
like instant flow state and i'm just
writing right and i don't even know what
i'm writing but it makes sense i'm just
kind of translating
what
is going on and i'm not this doesn't
make any sense but to the point it's
taught me a lot about my writing it can
teach you a lot about your writing but
it also sets the scene for what we're
going to talk about here relating to
focus because we're not talking about
writing here we're talking about focus
so i'm going to start with an alan watts
quote to set the scene here human
consciousness is at the same time as
being a form of awareness and
sensitivity and understanding it's also
a form of ignorance the ordinary
everyday consciousness that we have
leaves out more than it takes in and
because of this it leaves out things
that are terribly important it leaves
out things that if we did know them
allay our anxieties and our fears and
our horrors and if we could extend our
awareness you see to include those
things that we leave out we would have a
deep interior peace because we would all
know the one thing that mustn't that you
mustn't know
what is profound what is mysterious what
is in the depths alan watts so that is a
quote that i actually took and wrote
down from one of his lectures it's not a
direct quote and you can kind of tell
that it's all over the place because
he's speaking it right he's not writing
it and refining it and making it concise
that's just from his
physical words but what he's saying here
is that
human consciousness we are leaving out
the most important things we are not
conscious of the most important things
like data where he is speaking from
experience and it can't really be pieced
together
in a material form
that's what we leave out we leave out
experience we leave out being we leave
out the depth of focus that only human
beings have
that is what separates human beings from
every other animal or anything else is
depth of focus and of course depth of
consciousness
focus is vastly misunderstood and
under-appreciated and that is why i'm
writing the book the art of focus is
because there's much more to it a lot of
those in the self-help space
see it as a one-time tool
for getting into something like deep and
focused work or avoiding distractions
taking your focus off of distractions
getting into that flow state and
focusing on the task at hand but it is
much much much much much much deeper
than that so i'm going to throw up what
is called or what i have coined as the
focus matrix okay so you can see the
graph at the top you see contraction at
the bottom you see expansion on the left
you see unconscious on the right you see
conscious now within these quadrants are
different feelings or experiences that
come from how we control or manipulate
our own
focus so when you're in the top left
quadrant they're stressed anxious
reactive annoyed that's unconscious and
when your focus is contracted when
you're let's say hyper focused on
something negative in the future and
you're all stressed you're all anxious
and you're like laser focused on this
one little thing right this one little
thing that's causing all the problems
when all you need to do is become
conscious
zoom out and shift to that right side of
the matrix where
um you can zoom back in or you can stay
zoomed out and reap the benefits of
the experiences that come along with
that or the feelings emotions whatever
it be that comes along with that now
when you're in the bottom left of that
matrix
when your focus is wide so let's say
you're zoomed out but it's still
unconscious and so that's where like
chaos ensues and you feel like
overwhelmed or burnt out or there's too
many things to focus on and it just
leaves you like i don't know what to do
i'm lost in this
big open world of uncertainty right now
focus in my definition because
the we give things definition we give
things our own interpretation focus to
you may mean something completely
different so we need to set the stage
here and focus to me is conscious
attention so consciousness is the
essence of the human experience that's
this is consciousness
right here all of this everything you
can see and then attention is how we
process the information from
consciousness right so you are paying
attention to me right now you're
processing information whether it be
sensory whether it be um immaterial
information that's being stored in your
brain and that is exactly it we can pay
attention to what we are conscious of
right that is focus now in my book which
is the release date is to be determined
i have a lot to put in there a lot a lot
a lot of arguments to back up and make
credible but i present an argument for
what i call the three pillars now if you
were to only pay attention to these and
i'm not gonna go very in depth here but
if you were to only use these three
pillars as your way of navigating life
you would have a good life so the first
pillar is focus now focus and you
focusing all of your attention to me
signals ordered consciousness right it
signals order it signals uh like
conscious
on that graphic that we talked about
earlier when your
mind is ordered that means you are able
to focus much better and now in this
case i'm talking about what we have
talked about many many many times before
because this builds off of everything
i talk about having a vision for your
future having goals that stem from that
having priority tasks to bring your
focus to so now you have macro and micro
focus that you can manipulate and if you
watch my video on the creation pyramid
and how energy stems from that you'll
start to make connections about what i'm
talking about here with the three
pillars so
focus knowing what to focus on is
extremely important or else you get
distracted so you need vision you need
goals you need priorities you need
values you need to act with intention
and everything else that goes into the
creation pyramid you can find a link to
that in the description if you want to
watch that video but the second pillar
is energy so there's many different
kinds of energy but here i want to talk
about
fueling
where your focus is going right so let's
say you have a vision for the future
right or you have your priority tasks
that you're working on for when you get
into deep and focused work
now energy
everything that goes into your body
whether it be information or food or
even socialization just any input in
general should be directed to what
you're focused on right that allows you
to
bring that energy to something in the
future or right now so an example being
food if you have a vision of being
strong and jacked and good looking and
just having a healthy body in general
then the food needs to match that vision
goals priorities right
and that helps you act with intention
now the same thing goes for information
going into your head right that's
psychic energy if you want to be able to
use your mental or your psychic energy
to focus on a task then you need to have
either something in your subconscious
you need to have prior information that
gives you inspiration or just the energy
that comes from food as well to focus
and not have the brain fog and
everything else
you're pretty much
fueling your body
from all sources to give you energy and
that this comes from spiritual energy as
well so meditative
not being very stressed being conscious
and then directing that towards where
your focus should be placed and now the
third pillar is experience so that's
pretty much saying that with your focus
being able to
kind of tunnel vision on the life that
you want and if you have the energy to
go about that and kind of use your focus
back and forth to also pull that energy
in
you are doing this from a place of
presence or consciousness and you
practice this at all times so you can
act from your direct experience right
now that's what david data is doing when
he's writing that's what alan watts is
doing when he's speaking that's why we
resonate with his words so much even
though they don't necessarily make sense
they're not the most practical or the
most actionable uh
advices in the world but
they sound true they ease your worries
they kind of
pull you back and uh
show you that there is really nothing to
worry about in this present moment and
so that's what i mean by experience is
that you are acting from your direct
experience right now and all of these
the feedback cycles from focus energy
experience they all play into each other
right the energy helps with your
experience right now if you're
positively fueling
your body your mind your spirit then yes
your experience your direct experience
right now is going to be much more
pleasant than it would be if you did the
opposite the same with focus if you are
focused on your vision goals priorities
and you are blocking out the things that
come in the way of that and that tell
you otherwise and try to project their
opinions or their goals and vision and
beliefs on you
then
your life is going to or your experience
is going to suffer in that point in time
but if you're focused then your
experience is going to be good and they
all play into each other and you end up
having a great life now as with
everything that is material or that you
can sense or perceive or process right
now
it is only the tip of the iceberg right
consciousness goes much
further beyond that and we will dive
deeper into that in my book which will
be released at some point in time and
we'll probably talk about it in some
videos but as i said earlier there's one
thing that separates human beings from
everything else and that is depth of
focus okay i want you to kind of set
aside your beliefs and everything else
that comes to mind during this because
we're going to get a bit woo
right and i used to be
the guy that didn't like the whole
spiritual lingo i still have my opinions
about it but at the same time we're not
you you can't explain reality with words
that's against the point it doesn't work
like that words are layers upon layers
on top of reality when we're trying to
get to the core we are trying to
understand what cannot be seen
and what cannot be perceived by our mind
and our senses that are
survival based right just to paint a
picture here a frog can perceive
a much
wider range of light for example and
other animals can perceive different
things because that's how they survive
right we can sense things and things
interact with us
with our senses according to survival
like when you're about to get hit by a
car you get sent into fight or flight
and you get a stress response even
though it's not an elephant it's not a
line it's not going to eat you right
then you may get hit but there's a lot
of other things that go along with that
we have a psyche that's wired for
survival but we're living in this modern
world and we need to learn how to use
that psyche and we need to learn how to
transcend it to
see
from a few inches off the ground that's
how i see david data writing and alan
watts speaking and that's how a lot of
people that claim they have reached
enlightenment
they are
hovering two feet off the ground in
terms of reality they can see what
others can't see through their sixth
sense which is awareness so there's
expansion and contraction right
contraction is zooming in expansion is
zooming out uh contraction is divergent
i believe no convergent in term in
psychology psychological terms right
there's there's psychological viewpoints
on this there's philosophical viewpoints
on this there's a bunch of different
lenses of perceptions that you can
approach this from
so
convergent focus i believe is
contraction divergent focus is expansion
there's open there's wide for
expansion there's narrow there's deep
for contracted focus and you can start
to understand this a bit more so
uh with contraction
think of a little dot right focus on one
thing like hyper intensely in front of
you whether it be like my nose or just
focus on one thing and you can see that
everything else is blurred it's like a
camera lens right
and
expansion is like zooming out and
gaining spatial awareness or think of a
wider circle right you can play around
with this where i can focus very
intensely on the camera but then i can
zoom out a bit and bring more into
my
uh direct conscious experience through
focus and
the depth of focus that only humans have
focus is the most important skill that
has gone under people's noses it isn't
tangible it isn't material it's not
something you can see it's it's
you can't quantify it you can't quantify
focus you can't tell how zoomed in you
are right now wow this is interesting
right depth of focus where i'm focusing
on my hand and everything else is
blurred behind it you're focused on my
hand and everything else is blurred
behind it that's kind of been that's
kind of insane to me right do you ever
notice this and do you know that it's
not only material it's not only what you
see you can focus on things that aren't
material and this is what causes people
to live such shallow and surface level
lives where they only focus on what they
can see or what is the tip of the
iceberg so whether it be a negative
emotion
right and they laser focus on that and
they don't zoom out and they don't
practice that metacognition of
questioning that thought and determining
its rationality and whether or not it's
it's you or your ego and making that
separation
and
it's really unfortunate because this is
what spiritual teachers are talking
about when they say someone is asleep is
they are unable to kind of zoom their
focus out or expand their focus right
they aren't in tune with expansion and
they're just hyper contracted or hyper
focused on these things that just don't
matter and so when i say it's immaterial
or you can you have to become aware of
it right so you can become aware of
things that aren't
in your
how do i explain this they aren't
directly tangible to you like that we
can imagine things right so i can see
this camera in front of me and i can
imagine what's inside of it and the
parts moving together and once i dig in
there and start to see it i can actually
imagine this more and it sticks in my
head and i become directly conscious of
it and this happens with knowledge this
happens with memories this happens with
a lot of different things so conscious
living is another layer deeper becoming
conscious or at least practicing
becoming conscious of
all of the things you come in contact
with is how you develop depth
appreciation and love for
life and so this is how most people
conduct their lives is they only see the
tip of the iceberg when
there's an entire
iceberg underneath it and then there's
an ocean even further than that that we
haven't discovered the depths of so
people see what they see or feel what
they feel and they forget the rest
that's it that's their direct experience
that's their life there is no depth
there is no understanding there is no
awareness of the interdependence of life
itself there's no there's no focus or
consciousness of everything that has
created
let's say my identity or your identity
or everything that is interdependent
right now and what is required for me to
film this video what's required for you
to get a job and all the people involved
with that and all of the tools and
everything else that
allows you to get that job or even how
that job was created and everything that
stemmed from that and what that job
leads to and all these other things that
we're not conscious of when we just go
about our day-to-day life living in the
predictable future or the familiar past
and just letting that dictate our
emotions and emotions and push us around
rather than flowing with it and
understanding it and cultivating that
depth and that appreciation for what it
is through focus now i want to take you
through a few thought or consciousness
exercises because
i want you to understand this right this
video will drag on a bit longer than
necessary because one i don't really
care for this video to do well in the
youtube algorithm i want you to
understand i want you to live a better
life through
this discovery and i want you to
cultivate that depth and appreciation
and love for life itself so i talk about
the unknown a lot the unknown is a
concept of mine even though it's just
called the unknown nothing fancy but
i want you to think of it as a layer
beneath
reality and it's a dark it's a scary
place it's a scary place where infinite
opportunity lies so i want you to think
of your ego as a flashlight that you
hold it is not you it is not your being
it is a flashlight
right
and now think of the beam of light as
your perception and awareness or
consciousness or focus or whatever it
may be right because a flashlight it's
directed right it's kind of contracted
focus you can only see or perceive what
is within the light right so if you're
navigating the unknown or your life
because it is unknown it is uncertain
everything around you is a construction
right is a construction on top of
reality not only this i'm not talking
about material reality here i'm talking
about immaterial right because
experience it's uncertain to us because
it's a dark scary place it's just yeah
so the beam of light emitted from this
flashlight is your perception now as you
are exploring the unknown now it's you
aren't exploring the unknown if you are
not conscious that you're exploring the
unknown you're just going about life but
now think of
your life as a culmination of the things
that you have become directly conscious
of now if you are unconscious and you're
letting your ego take the reign with
that flashlight your your
your life is going to be composed of
things that you're not in direct control
of right the
the flashlight kind of has a mind of its
own and it gets distracted and uh it
prefers negativity and so your
flashlight is going to focus on those
things and then your mind is going to
process and register that as whatever it
is so
you're in a dark room and the unknown
let's say it spans in infinite
directions right it's just it's just
your life you're navigating life you're
going about life in this dark room and
now when you create a vision for your
future think of it as like a light at
the end of the tunnel like a light
somewhere in some direction in the
unknown right so it's all around me it's
dark but i see a light at the end of the
tunnel and then your goals are like
little candles that are kind of like
breadcrumbs toward that direction so you
are acting with intention as you are
going through your vision and you it is
making it much easier to navigate the
unknown aspects of your life it it
frames your focus to go towards those
things whether it be physically or just
throughout your life
towards your goals visions and
priorities which is much much closer to
you and allows you to kind of like move
your way and it gives you a path and all
of that is your mission right that's
your mission in this map of the unknown
and you are moving in that direction
rather than letting your ego or that
flashlight limit your perception and you
you may not even see your vision right
it may throw you in a completely
different direction on something
negative over here and then you start
moving that way way off course from what
you actually want to do in your life and
you end up going in a weird direction so
now i want you to throw the flashlight
away throw your ego away and of course
this is
not that easy you don't just throw it
away right it takes years of development
to kind of reverse the programming and
conditioning that has been uh culminated
throughout your entire life through your
parents school system colleagues peers
just everything you've processed a
social media post
thousands of times per day it takes time
to reverse that and become aware of that
and everything else it's a lifelong
process so now uh this is a thought or
consciousness exercise um and i kind of
pulled it from a meditation that i did a
while back from a youtube video i forget
exactly what one which one but he has
you sit down he as you close your eyes
uh he has you go through the normal
meditation motions where you focus on
your breath but i want you to imagine
that there is a
radiating ball of light in your chest
right and you can bring your awareness
to it i'm not talking about an actual
ball of light here okay i'm talking
about bringing your awareness to certain
aspects of your body so let's say it
starts in your stomach right and the
ball expands to fit your stomach
now if you were to stop this video and
sit there and imagine it can you become
aware of that ball right now can you
contract it
with your focus to let's say take up the
space of your belly button so can you
become aware of your belly button
and now can you expand it in
height to start
filling your entire body
right now that is what awareness is
awareness is that light that is emitted
from the flashlight of perception but
we're not talking about an ego here
right we're talking about expanding our
focus to take up more space now
let's say you take up your entire body
or you're aware of that
and again this is all metaphorical all
understanding is metaphorical so you may
not understand this the first time
around but you're in the unknown and
let's say your body is just a radiating
light right it's going to be much easier
when you were conscious of all of those
things around you right where
this is kind of an off quote but maybe
it'll help further your understanding of
this where
uh someone
someone out there came up with this
brilliant quote where it's we're not
humans having a spiritual experience
where uh
wait yeah no that's it it's it's
we're spiritual beings having a human
experience not human beings having a
spiritual experience right so we are
spiritual beings
stuck in this body right consciousness
and
as you're walking through the unknown
and your body is emitting this light
because you are aware of more things and
let's say that the light is only like
this far right you think of a candle and
you can only see
what it lights up on that map and so if
your body is emitting some kind of light
that you're directly conscious of
you can become conscious of the things
that are within
that light but now if you sit here and
you expand your focus to let's say this
room right
so you zoom out you stop focusing on
things and you bring the entire room to
your awareness you can do this a bit at
a time where it's like i'm conscious of
my body i'm conscious of the chair that
i'm sitting in i'm conscious of the
floor that's under me i'm conscious of
how that connects to the tripod and the
camera in front of me and the wall to
the right and now i'm starting to become
conscious of these little things by
manipulating
uh or controlling consciousness with my
focus so in a sense this is what
conscious living is but it's not only
material right we're not only becoming
directly conscious of what's in the room
we're becoming directly conscious of
let's say the rogue thoughts that are
coming into our head or the emotions
that are there or the reactions to
certain things we're becoming conscious
of that because we have expanded our
consciousness to kind of catch that as
it comes into that light source that
we're admitting emitting
with
our awareness so a lot of this comes
with practice and of course i i just
wanted to give you a new perspective on
focus and kind of like bridge the gap
between
like like
what people understand like the the
people that follow me where it's a lot
of business stuff it's a lot of like
pragmatic advice and kind of the
spiritual world i want to bridge that
and i want to open more people up to a
better way of living through
consciousness and focus and all of these
other things and showing you how to use
the one tool that separates you from
every other being in existence and is
the key to both material and immaterial
success now this isn't a very pragmatic
video it's it's titled something like
how to master your focus but
people think like oh that's going to
help me become
super productive and it's like yeah it
can but it can also open up an entirely
new dimension of living right
and that alone i believe is worth it so
we're going to expand on this in many
other videos but i just wanted to bring
that to your attention maybe i'll create
a meditation around this at some time
because that's really the key to let's
say happiness
which is just a word right we're trying
to label an experience but let's say
it's the key to happiness right where
i i read this quote one time and i
forget exactly what it is but i created
my own version of it where it's
zoom in on what's important so focus on
your vision goals priority etc zoom in
on what's important zoom out from
everything else right just become
conscious of it when you bring awareness
to something the whatever pain is there
it dissipates whatever negativity is
there or negative interpretation of what
is there dissipates if it doesn't then
you are not conscious you are not
there there is no expanded consciousness
there is no awareness or the awareness
of what is actually causing that
negativity it's not there we can discuss
that in another video but if you enjoyed
this one uh leave a comment below
letting me know what you thought because
i like talking about these kinds of
things right even though they're not
directly
applicable right now and it's kind of a
process of development but if you like
this video leave a comment letting me
know
