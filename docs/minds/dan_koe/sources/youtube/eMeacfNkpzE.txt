what's up i'm
kind of pissed right now and
it's
i i need to paint this picture
right because i've made some
realizations recently and it's it's
really
enlightening and it's it's started to
connect everything that i've i've
recently known right because i'm a
spiritual guy i
was diving into spirituality and i
started to go down the rabbit hole of
oh like the universe is everything
like the material world doesn't matter i
can just float off into nothingness and
you know enjoy my life in the infinite
peace but that's not what
the the spiritual teachings are saying
spirituality is a lens of viewing the
world from but let me let me let
me paint this picture right so
there's this guy
jimmy
meet jimmy he is the epitome of the
average male right he went to school he
got a decent job he did everything that
society and his parents told him to do
and
jimmy he was happy for a bit but after
that monotonous repetition of life
he fell into a rut
right uber eats porn netflix cheez-its
 hot pockets hot pockets you
know like everything that
everything that isn't really bad the
first time around if you make a
conscious decision to play a video game
or eat a hot pocket or order uber eats
and you are conscious of it and you
understand the negative effects that
it's going to have on you it's not a
problem but if that unconscious
if that goes unconscious and it leads to
30 years that go by in the blink
of an eye of just plain mediocrity and
you waste your life
do you see the problem here right and
this happens to way too many
people 95 of the population is just
absolutely distracted by all of these
the the modern life and technological
advancements and all of the cheap
dopamine suckers out there
and it just doesn't make sense and jimmy
was offered a helping hand the the
universe gave it to him
and
it was a feeling like a call to
adventure
right the universe or a higher version
of himself a future version of himself
was calling begging for mastery begging
to be woken up and actualized and have
that shift in consciousness that allows
you to just plow through everything in
your path so
jimmy of course being the guy that he is
he picks up the remote he clicks
skip intro on the netflix screen he
takes a bong rep and then he wakes up
tomorrow just to put on his work clothes
and go through the same familiar
experiences that he's lived out for his
entirety of his life
now
jimmy
is a concept
he was created by you in your head while
you were listening to what i'm saying
and when you stop thinking of jimmy
he doesn't exist he ceases to exist when
you stop watching this video jimmy isn't
a thing anymore your attention
the things that you give attention to
are what you bring life to and that's
just it
the your attention is the barrier
between jimmy and the void right
nothingness or infinity or presence and
this concept or story or
layer or overlay of reality right so
poof jimmy's gone
now if you are into spirituality like me
or just philosophy or really anything uh
of that nature you have probably heard
some rendition of the universe is a
giant mind now what does that mean okay
the mind our mind our ego which is don't
label this as bad or have any negative
reaction to it our mind
makes sense of things via stories
concepts
symbols language
and metaphors understanding is a
metaphor right to understand a specific
concept like jimmy
we need to understand the network of
other concepts
that were created to aid in that
understanding right this is how the
world is a giant mind is because
reality or i guess what you see what you
perceive as reality the material world
is a network it is an overlay of stories
and symbols and metaphors and languages
that help us understand and make sense
and give meaning to life so
why is your hand a hand right would it
be a hand
if it was
uh not connected to an arm would an arm
be an arm if it didn't have a body would
a cup be meaningless if uh it didn't
have a hand to pick it up if it didn't
have a human being
another concept and metaphor for just us
trying to explain
what
this material world is would a cup be a
cup
would the meaning of a cup still be the
meaning of a cup if it didn't have a
hand to pick it up and put it into your
mouth so a cup relies on a hand to
actually be understood as a cup the
purpose and meaning of a cup
is given because we have a hand and of
course
other things go into that but another
example is gravity what is what the
is gravity do you know what gravity is
can you understand gravity without
understanding force or the gravitational
constant or the mass of an object or the
distance between the centers of a mass
how do you determine if something's a
center does it have to have an inner and
an outer right you can see
the overlay of stories and metaphors and
symbols that help us understand every
single thing that goes into life right
so now that we understand the importance
of stories and metaphors and symbols and
mainly stories the things that give
meaning to life stories give meaning to
life they help us make sense of the
world that's how our mind interacts with
the world
and we can paint the picture here of why
you aren't where you want to be in life
and why
i
would hope that you get a bit pissed
after this because here's the thing your
identity who you are who you perceive
yourself as this character that you're
playing and if you're conscious it is
the the character the stories that
comprise who you are
what is the story that you're telling
yourself right now
are you the broke college student that
uh is gonna go and work a job and uh
retire and uh just sit around and watch
netflix all day and be forgotten in the
the other 99 of stories out there that
just go unheard and unfulfilled and lack
of meaning later in this we're going to
talk about of course how to overcome
that but what are you are you the hero
of your own story or are you the villain
of the own story because here's the
thing
a hero does not exist without a villain
right you cannot understand what the
concept of a hero is without
understanding what the concept of a
villain is now that's just the thing
this is this is the law of polarity good
and bad you cannot have good if you do
not have bad good does not exist if you
do not have bad they are opposing forces
right now whether these are good or bad
and and
give you that uh negative emotion is up
to you that's a product of psychological
time right you aren't present if you are
negatively affected or just like if you
are suffering you are not present you
are projecting or ruminating on the
future or the past because remember this
is it's all a story it's all a game and
it's all within your control because
it's all in your mind right it's all
dependent on how you perceive the story
and how the story is told in your mind
you see other people and you tell a
story about them whether you're
conscious of it or not that's the
difference conscious versus unconscious
you see a person and you assume their
story and that causes a negative
reaction you because it's a reflection
of the story you are telling about them
it is a reflection of you and you have
full control
over that perception so given that life
implies
suffering hero implies
a villain if you
uh
are not conscious of this or you have
expectations for what life is supposed
to be
then you will suffer if you expect life
not to
imply
suffering then you will suffer rather
than going and accepting what is not
letting it cause that negative reaction
see the necessity of the suffering and
let it cause enjoyment law of polarity
transmutation etc etc you
are the actor you are the player behind
the character you are not the stories
that have been overlaying on reality you
are the observer from the behind that
can rig the game in your favor and learn
how to play the game effectively by
leveraging stories and concepts and all
of these different things that's where
meaning is created by being able to
create your own reality create your own
story and
just forge a path of greatness and
excellence in all the things that you do
right good evil push pull woo way this
is what the ancient philosophers
spiritual gurus and everything else are
saying you need that polarity you need
that tension in order to have meaning in
your life and that's just the thing a
story is a dance between the hero and
the villain and as i talked about
earlier the villain is not someone else
the villain is in yourself because you
are
telling yourself the story of that other
person you can observe another person
right and you can assume the story but
if you are conscious of it you
understand that is it is a reflection of
your internal state and you can make
that uh
pivot in life direction on your own it
is a dance with yourself and you are
kind of fighting this villain that's
what makes a story interesting right if
the hero didn't fight a villain if the
hero just went and succeeded there
wouldn't be a story there would be no
meaning there would be no purpose in
that life right and so that's what this
is it's a constant battle against
yourself and understanding who you don't
want to become and who you want to
become and
having that battle on a day-to-day basis
and like tapping into those energy
sources and transmuting and and
existing or being in the present moment
while playing the game from an
enlightened perspective
without suffering from it so with that i
ask you the question
are you where you want to be in life do
you have the
mind the wisdom the body the the
physique the energy the
the
whatever it is what do you want in life
what do you not want in life that's
easier to figure out because you can
just look around you can go to a
walmart and look around and observe and
see the reflection in yourself that's
what you work away from and that's how
you know what you want to become i don't
know if you want to become rich or not
it's something to work towards to see if
you actually want to become rich how do
you know if you don't want to become
rich if you haven't beco become rich and
experience that right it's only evil
it's only truly evil or perceived as
evil if you perceive it as evil
by
experience experiencing everything that
it takes to get there and then being
able to step back and make
the conscious
decision of understanding whether it's
evil or not to you now that's the thing
are you the main character of the story
that you are living out right now or are
you a byproduct of the layers of stories
and uh
biases and beliefs that other people
have projected on you that you have
unconsciously taken on right constantly
saying oh i'm i'm the broke college
student oh i'm just a i'm just a stoner
bro i i'm not good enough i can't i
can't do that i'm not good enough to do
that the the negative self-talk oh i'm
scrawny and weak i'll never be jacked
 that dude you
become from what i've said you've be you
become
the story that you tell yourself
if you are telling and you can do this
in any situation if you're out there and
you're conversing with women or a big
player businessman or just someone it's
all in your head it's a reflection of
the story that you are telling yourself
about that person and that is dictating
your actions because you're you're
projecting at that point you aren't
conscious of it of the thought processes
that are going through your head that
are creating those actions
and it's oh man it's it's insane once
you make this realization and how you
need to
fully embody the good and evil from a
conscious perspective and allow that
dance to happen so you can make progress
in the material world what else are we
here for if you go full hippie and
spiritual you're just going to fall back
that's that
why do we have this body why are the
layers created why do we have the mind
that interprets everything as a story
and metaphors right if there's a purpose
behind it and that is to create purpose
and create your reality and level up and
if you if you don't want to do that then
i would argue that that is just a story
that you were telling yourself and you
aren't conscious of that story right why
would you
why would you want to make it much
easier to suffer and become
unconscious
by not
taking advantage of the resources that
are available to you in the modern world
and this stresses the necessity of
conscious identity creation
conscious right once these things become
automatic and once you
stop
giving having that awareness or giving
those things your attention and
breathing life into those
then that's where the problem comes in
right because you are no longer in the
present moment consciousness implies
presence if you are the observer of the
thoughts and actions that you're doing
you are in the present moment you aren't
projecting into that uh future and past
and the memories and just living letting
those things live out so to do this you
have to frame your attention on the
things that you want to bring to life
right so you need a vision
you i say this all the time you
need a vision you need goals you need
priorities you need to frame your focus
to the things that will
make your life better in terms of your
physique how do you want to look
what does that require in terms of food
what does that require in terms of
training what does it are you going on
walks are you if you want to
make a lot of money and have that
resource are you building a business are
you spreading a good word are you
aligned with the path of truth and doing
so consciously right it's pretty
 simple it's like okay how do i
do this stuff dan you learn and you
apply you have access to the
internet dude
you have access to the internet learn
anything you want buy it
either learn via free resources or buy a
course and then you apply those
resources or that course to your life on
a consistent and conscious
basis and you start to create this story
or reality that will be told about you
or the one that you are telling to
yourself so you can live a meaningful
and purposeful life and not only that
but a life of just vitality and energy
and zest
right because the if you don't have that
polarity that tension that push pull
there is no energy there's there's
nothing being created and even then
you're not in control of it that yeah
there's going to be energy and there's
going to be negative emotions but you
are going to be a victim of those things
you aren't going to be in control of
them because it's unconscious you're
just going to think it's a part of life
and you're expecting life to be a
different way but not doing anything
about it when the answer is right in
front of you it's consciousness it's
it's flowing with the way that life is
it's flowing from a conscious
perspective
with the game that is being played and
you need to make very very smart moves
in that game in order to find meaning in
the life you want to live and now i'm
saying all these things like get jacked
get rich
uh whatever whatever this
like this one that is a good thing to do
because there are a lot of other people
doing it and you can see what it
leads to and now the people that are
rich but unhappy they aren't conscious
that's the exact thing a lot of people
do this and then they become unconscious
and they take on other bad habits and
this is for all areas of your life right
you can become rich and that can fulfill
you a little bit that can be give you
some meaning right that can give you
something to do but then what about your
health what if you're unconsciously
suffering in other areas of life you
have to be conscious of everything
so with that you have to become
conscious again of the things that are
within your control those that's the
what you can do right the things you
have access to right here your physique
your health your vitality your energy
the the money in your bank account
whatever it may be
that is what you have direct control
over if you're working a job and you
aren't building a business on the side
what the do you expect to happen
and how in the world do you expect to
make progress in this world if there's
no room for improvement past a specific
point you can't break through through
you can't really you can't break through
to that next level and
achieve what you were meant to achieve
you're not playing the game anymore once
you hit that cap you're just going
through the motions so
what do we do is
you kind of have to get pissed
that's
from everyone that i've talked to
whether they're conscious of it or not
you have to get pissed in order to
launch yourself in the opposite
direction
right you need to give conscious thought
about how every single thought and
action
and habit and routine and friends in
your life and environment and everything
is affecting your progress and it's not
that you have to get rid of all of those
things but you have to get pissed and
demand more from yourself and that's
exactly what you do once you become
conscious of those things you can start
the dance you can start becoming the
hero that is working against the
villains you can start creating some
form of meaning you can start
waking up with a purpose and starting to
do things you can use that anger and
that pissed-ness because it's just
it's the same same but different of
let's say good and evil evil being anger
good it's it's the same thing
one cannot exist without the other one
is on the opposite polar scale as the
other and if you are conscious of it it
leads you in the opposite direction this
is what people call transmutation if you
are
angry
if you get pissed and then you do
nothing about it you're just gonna
continue being pissed you have to get
pissed at a specific thing and transmute
that energy and use that energy to build
something better for yourself you need
to build a better life for yourself you
need to fight that demon with that
energy you need to become polarized
right
of everything and this is completely up
to you when
i
want to lose weight i get very polarized
i i start seeing junk food as just
 disgusting i would never touch
that in my life right and that's a
battle with me
it just but it becomes so simple just
not to eat it once you are conscious
once you start to become polarized and
it's like no i am healthy i am lean i am
all of these good things i'm already
jacked it's just a matter of time and
then it flows flow state right you
understand the the flow blockers like
junk food and other things that they're
just
disgusting to you they don't make any
sense you want to quit cigarettes become
fully conscious i think it was osho that
said this but you become fully conscious
of the cigarette and you start to see it
as stupid you label it as stupid and
then you start to see that reflection in
yourself like i'm not stupid why am i
even doing this then it just
becomes easy and the negative effects of
that you transmute it right it's the
hermetic axiom of like if you
uh like law of cause and effect and law
of rhythm where if you are transmuted on
this positive pole the negative just
kind of passes under you it doesn't mean
anything right and
this is all you need to form good habits
if you want to quit a bad habit you
become fully conscious of that and that
may not make sense to you until you dive
into the spiritual side of things so i'm
wrapping it up here you have to stay
grounded and connected to truth
while seeing the game of life for what
it is and then you need to play that
character and consciously create the
life you want to live as the awareness
or the consciousness that is overlooking
that and correcting things
as you get feedback
so that's just it set aside time
to do this one hour a day minimum one
hour
on your business learn what you have to
learn
start a business go to the
 gym learn what you have to learn
you don't know how to do it you feel a
little bit afraid gain clarity learn
about it there's you have the internet
learn
okay
and then one hour on your mental health
or your spiritual health or other things
or philosophy or metaphysics as
existentialism to help you understand
all of this more
and help you understand what game you
are actually playing in this life and
stop viewing yourself as just a negative
conglomerate of stories you are
you are already jacked you are already
rich you are already confident and you
should not accept anything less from
yourself but excellence and that's just
the thing what the do you have to
do that is better than that
that that's it what the else do you
have to do that's better than that is
porn more fulfilling than going to the
gym no no
what the like
is a hot pocket more fulfilling
than eating a bowl of fruit or grass-fed
beef or
some goat's milk kefir or just getting
your protein in and moving towards your
goals no of course not there's no battle
there you're just succumbing to the
negative give me the hot pocket
i'm gonna eat the hot pocket right now
no that you don't have anything to
do that is better or more meaningful
than making conscious progress in this
life
absolutely nothing
it's all in your mind go
do something just
do something
you
