the average writer makes sixty nine
thousand five hundred and ten dollars a
year last year I made eight hundred
thousand dollars writing for two hours a
day and just a few days a week and of
course I did work more than this but I'm
talking about writing right like the
base of my business everything I do
revolves around writing and I do that
for around two hours every single day so
here are nine steps to becoming a
profitable writer even if you have zero
dollars in your bank account first why
writing because the future belongs to
those that Master the internet they
Master Media or code and with an
abundance of no code website Builders
and just other like organizational tools
like notion and other things and even
just social media in general allows you
to not have to learn how to code right
leave that to the passionate coders out
in the world if you are a passionate
coder you're doing great things thank
you artificial intelligence is also
coming into place so it's it's best for
most people to mask Master media right
which is the front end of the internet
where people see what catches attention
what leads into products or Services
that's what drives sales that's what
puts money in your pockets is media and
the foundation of media is writing right
because writing then gets turned into a
video script or like a real script or
something that you see online right
writing out any form of script or video
first comes first right it makes the
video better so writing is foundational
because you think about it that's all
you see right you see writing
transformed into other things you see
tweets that's writing you see Instagram
posts that's writing you see reels it's
a written script you see a newsletter
that's writing you see a YouTube video
it's also a written script so I'll shut
up about writing it's important it's
very important the best skill you can
learn here's the nine steps first is to
choose a topic that you can't shut up
about write down your favorite books
your YouTube watch History your favorite
social media accounts and what you would
write about if money wasn't an issue
good writing is about energy transfer
not being professional we earned English
degrees here right everyone can write
everyone can write with impact you don't
need to be super grammatically correct
the second step is to brainstorm a
unique perspective novelty catches
attention and attention is necessary for
people to read what you write right A
lot of people always talk about like oh
catching attention is dirty uh you're
just contributing you're doing the same
thing as all the other people uh with
the cheap dopamine and catching
attention you have to catch attention
right that's what you're doing at any
given second of the day when you put on
cologne to go out you're wanting to
attract a person when you slick your
hair in the morning you're not doing it
for yourself if you're only if you're
the only person on this Earth You
wouldn't be going through all these
grooming habits you're trying to catch
attention on a daily day-to-day basis
you might as well make that conscious
and do something good with it and so
novel perspectives are how you
differentiate yourself through
experience with the things that you
write about right so when it comes to
novelty catching attention I love this
quote right I say this all the time
where people need to be reminded more
than they need eat something new but
I've changed that now I see it as people
need to be reminded with something new
right they need to be reminded of the
fundamentals the base lessons that are
going to actually bring progress to
their life but from A New Perspective
and the best way to do that is through
your personal experience right so tell a
story about the things that you're
learning and then you can never run out
of angles to say things talk about your
own story your own perspective your own
thoughts other people's stories stories
that you curate and find online things
like that so step number three is to
write 1000 words on the topic every
piece of content is based around a
personal or professional problem so how
do you structure it you paint a picture
of the problem this is to start off
writing your 1000 words you talk about
your personal experience and you give
step-by-step advice on how to solve the
problem actionable advice is how you
build an audience at the start to prove
your worth and value and so step number
four is to sign up for a blog or
newsletter software I rarely use fancy
sales funnels anymore and that's when my
income off right direct response
marketing is important it's good to
learn it's good to understand the
fundamentals it's it's good to
understand how you facilitate the
transfer of money and persuade people to
see the value in your services but at
the same time it gets a bit too crazy
and so when I strip down everything made
it super simple my Revenue shot up to
800k last year and potentially
projecting 2.5 million this year so
instead I use a Content ecosystem so I
write one newsletter a week that's why
we're writing 1000 words right now you
upload the newsletter as a Blog and then
you write one thread condensed from the
newsletter and you write three tweets a
day from ideas in the newsletter and
then those get turned into YouTube video
scripts LinkedIn posts Instagram
carousels reels tick tocks and a podcast
okay right so we're picking we have a
topic that we can't shut up about we
write 1000 words just to practice just
to get it out of the way we use a basic
structure problem personal experience
actionable steps to overcome the problem
that's how you write the 1000 words you
post that to a newsletter you upload it
to a Blog you turn that into a thread or
a medium form like Instagram Carousel
you turn those into three tweets a day
you cross post a tweet sensegram
LinkedIn everywhere and then under those
things you link your blog post now why
is that important because in the
newsletter or in the blog post that's
the best place to promote your products
or Services right it's the most
trustworthy and authoritative place to
promote them rather than writing like a
one-liner tweet oh go live your best
life and then under it it's like oh buy
my course on how to live your best life
like you're not gonna make too many
sales doing that you might as well write
a longer piece a newsletter upload it to
a Blog have a good call to action to
your product or service link the blog
under your tweets related tweets on a
weekly basis and then that's how you
make more sales that's how my Revenue
shot up so step number five is to
repurpose the actionable part of the
newsletter because actionable and
in-depth advice is the most potent and
beginner friendly way to start growing
on social media that's how you build
Authority at the start don't try to be
too clever when nobody knows who you are
your favorite YouTubers didn't start as
lifestyle vloggers they gave actionable
advice in an eternal Market health
wealth relationships you go and look at
anyone's YouTube channel they usually
started by establishing Authority in one
domain or a few domains like
self-improvement because that involves
like lifting weights getting dates more
place more dates and other things like
that right you get the point so step
number six is to learn how to network
and grow on the platform itself so I
previously made a video it's called the
non-needy networking process again one
of those videos that doesn't get enough
views because
it's I don't know why it's one of the
most like actionable and beneficial
things you can do it will get you the
most progress because you're not going
to win a game the social media game if
you don't understand the rules and
mechanics right you can I see this way
too often especially in modern Mastery
where people come in they say like hey
I've been writing content and I'm not
getting any followers it's like that's
not how it works if everyone if you just
wrote content and got followers then
everyone would be a content creator you
have to understand the game of social
media you have to understand how to get
eyes on your content and that is done
manually at the start you do not rely on
the algorithm you network with people
and get them to share your content so in
general you need both good content and
eyes on that content you need readers
sharing your writing because hopefully
it's good writing you need to network
with similar follower accounts and grow
together need to comment on larger
accounts so people can see your comment
and click to your profile and you make
your newsletter so good that people
can't help but talk about it and you
join a community and meet people people
doing the same thing as you like modern
Mastery and of course you still need
good content and a compelling brand to
make this work right it's not one or the
other it's not oh I only write good
content and just hope I grow on social
media not gonna work or I'm just gonna
Network all day and get people to share
my content and hope that I grow on
social media but the content is and
I'm not putting effort in there not
gonna work if there's a hole or a
problem in your brand fix it step number
seven is to turn ideas into impactful
tweets from your newsletters so the 1000
words you wrote earlier that you're
going to do on a weekly basis maybe
something like that you have a plethora
of ideas that you can pull from that you
can read one sentence and be like okay
how do I turn this into a tweet if you
want to learn how to write better tweets
watch my how to generate infinite ideas
or unlimited content ideas video and my
best advice with this is to just create
lists create like two to three lists and
what I mean by lists is like if you
wrote about bodybuilding then right five
reasons to become a bodybuilder
something like that list off the five
reasons and then you turn each of those
five reasons into their own tweet or
list and then you just keep going and
then that's how you create start to
create like infinite content ideas but
you're only going to be doing it once a
week because you're going to be rotating
topics based on your newsletter now step
number eight is to develop a writing
system so take out a notebook study
writing and social media Frameworks so
like Pas which is problem amplify
solution Ada attention interest desire
action Pastor problem amplify
story testimony offer resolution and
then social media Frameworks like how to
grow and so like the one we talked about
where it's like DM people to network
with them grow comment on larger
accounts just take a basic social media
course and you're fine then write down a
process you can test to write
newsletters tweets Etc test it daily and
refine it when you hit a roadblock right
what you're doing here is you're just
creating systems you're creating
step-by-step things that you are going
to do on a daily basis to do things
better right so if you learn okay I need
to write my newsletter with this
framework then write down the steps to
do that and then use the steps that you
gave yourself and then when something
comes up when a problem comes up then
you actually have something you can
change and test and so if that doesn't
work for you then you go and look up
okay how do I get better ideas you find
a technique you implement it you change
the steps a bit and then eventually you
develop a system that becomes so
profitable that you can sell not so
profitable that you can sell but so
impactful and gets you so much results
that you can sell it if you want to or
you can just milk it and get a ton of
results that's what every single person
does that's how you get results with
anything if you want to grow on social
media create steps refine them over time
boom you win and this is also how you
decrease your mental energy expenditure
on the actual system is by refining it
over time so what used to take me four
hours of writing now takes me one to two
hours just because it's second nature to
me and I have my own system and so the
last step number nine is to Branch out
to different platforms I've repurposed
my writing from Twitter and my
newsletter and I've grown to 300 000 on
Twitter 1.5 million on Instagram 200 and
like 75 on YouTube which is newsletter
as a script for the videos and then I
create the reels by writing a script for
them and that's what helps me grow on
like Tick Tock and other things but
overall I get more engagement than most
people like most fitness models or
writing right is the most impactful
thing that's what everyone can read
everyone can take a lesson from the
screen and engage with it and share it
with other people once you start doing
this and once you start stacking your
own content then you start to see which
of your ideas do the best and you can
start on one platform like Twitter and
then once you have like 10 ideas that do
well then you can take those to other
platforms and use them to grow faster
right that's what I did and so the last
thing as always this takes a lot of time
right this has been like a
three to five year thing for me being a
Creator where like when I say three to
five years those first those that
two-year Gap is like me not really
taking it seriously where I made like my
first 10K and then started slowly
increasing and it was like 100k 150k and
then 800k when I finally figured this
 out and now it's going even higher
than that so all in all just stick it
out there's a way to do it as a writer
you just have to do like take action and
be consistent for what would be getting
a four-year degree but it's not like
you're not getting paid along the way if
you offer a product or service along the
way by watching my other videos and last
thing uh solopreneur Sprints starts on
the 15th right so that's where you build
the base of your one-person business uh
we write content together we create a
brand together and there's just a bunch
of other bonus things that help with
what we talked about in this video so
I'd encourage you check that out Link in
the description digital economics along
with that doubles in price on that date
just because people keep telling me to
do it so we're going to try it out then
lastly if you want my writing system
check out to our writer all that stuff's
in the description aside from that like

buy anything all good I appreciate you
either way peace
