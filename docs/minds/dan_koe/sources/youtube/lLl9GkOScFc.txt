Attention.
Isn't the new currency
information is because that's all humans
really do.
We process information with our senses
and then we store it
and we use that information
to create or destroy.
I'd like to believe that the unconscious
evolution aligned
intent behind modern technology,
mainly social media,
is to give us the information
that we wouldn't
normally have access to,
thus increasing our potential in life.
Information leads
to awareness of opportunity.
Awareness of opportunity leads
to profitable ideas.
Profitable ideas
lead to positive behavior change.
Now, manipulation of information can lead
to things
like death,
destruction, scams
and other things like that.
But we're here to talk about
something different.
We're here to talk about
the good sides of information
and how you can use information
to create a better life for yourself.
We live in the age of information.
We don't live in the industrial age
or something like that.
We live in a great time
because there is an abundance of ideas
and just a ton of opportunities for
things that we can pursue.
But on the other side,
there is an overwhelm of the same things
and overwhelm of information.
And so I want you to
understand one thing, and that is
everything is information.
Our genetic code is information.
The light we see is information.
The words on the screen,
we read as clearly information.
But anything that we sense is information
that we use as humans to either
correct our behavior
or change our behavior.
If we touch fire and it's hot.
That's information
to take your hand away from the fire.
Everything is information
that we process, understand
or don't understand or misunderstand
and then use to move better in the world.
So it only makes sense
that with better knowledge
and better understanding
and clarity of information
that we will make better decisions
as human beings that lead to a life
that we potentially love.
Everyone has the same big goal
that they're trying to achieve,
and that goal is to increase the quality
of your human experience
as much as possible.
That's what we're trying to do.
If you're on social media,
you're trying to get a good feeling,
maybe even a bad feeling,
just so you feel something.
Our thoughts, emotions and actions,
which are all forms
of information, dictate
our human experience.
And that experience is information
in the form of feedback.
So it's just a constant information
loop that we are going through.
And so we're going
to be talking about this
in the next video
when we talk about
how life is a video game.
But we've also talked about it
a few times before
and that is that
the mind tends toward disorder
because it is a system systems,
they tend toward disorder
because of entropy.
And in order to maintain
order in our minds,
we need to consume or receive
structured and ordered information
that we understand,
because this is what happens.
Maybe we can't
group everything into this phenomenon,
but people hate
what they don't understand,
and that's exactly it.
It's not their mind isn't ordered
because they don't understand
the information.
They are missing a side of the argument.
And we're speaking in terms of
like communication
here, spoken or written language,
because there is content
and there is consciousness.
So consciousness is our senses
and or the sensory field
that we have available to us.
And the content
is what
we can kind of interact
with and receive information
from to understand.
And so the structure of that content
dictates
the structure of our consciousness
or orders
our consciousness
to the point of just feeling good.
And so it's just a fact
that anyone can observe
that most people
use online information
as a way to distract themselves
through argument,
mainstream news,
or just flavor of the day drama.
And then there's another group of people,
a second group of people
that realize that this is a trap
because they observe.
Maybe they understand that
it's leading them down the wrong path
and they eventually become curious
of what the other path looks like,
what it looks like to go
in the opposite direction
and find good information
that they can build their life with.
And so if you haven't already guessed
by what we talk about in
these videos
is we're going to be talking
about information products
and how to create a good one
because you have $100,000 in your head.
So we just talked about two groups,
the distracted and the curious,
but there's one other group
that is interesting.
They are the ones that are trapped
in the negative cycle
of consuming content
that tells them
that new information is bad.
And when I say new information,
I mean things like courses, right?
Courses.
We all know that some get a bad rap.
Many people that take courses
know that there are incredible
ones out there
that can genuinely change your life.
Right.
Because the thing is, is that
that there's
two different ways
or modalities of education in this age.
There is the formal education system
which will train you
into the employment system
that it is directly tied with.
And then there is the creator economy.
So people putting out
free information online
after they forge a new path in this world
and they teach you how to do it yourself.
So if you want in
a career of independence
and doing your own thing,
you're probably you may
or may not find that
in the formal education route,
and especially not for free online.
If you can think critically
and you can find a good person worth
investing in for a course
that teaches you what they do
or what
they've discovered
as a better way of doing things,
or maybe a new career path
that has been created
because of the Internet,
then that could be a very good route
to go.
And I believe that
those are the modes of education
that are going to teach you
how to do your own thing
rather than how to do
someone else's thing.
So my whole point with
this is that, one,
if you have a negative connotation
around courses
or coaching or just information
products in general, one,
I would encourage you to
go into this video with an open mind.
But at the same time,
if you're stuck in that mental trap,
then don't watch the video, right?
I don't want people.
It doesn't make sense
that you would write off
an epoch of existence,
the age of information,
just because you had one bad experience
with a sleazy marketer or some sleazy
snake oil salesman. Right.
Liver king comes to mind here,
even though he's not selling courses.
But that's for another time.
And I don't like getting involved
in, like, the whole drama stuff.
So to the people that are still here,
I want to tell you
that you have
$100,000 worth of information
sitting in your head.
You may not, right now,
but some of you do.
And so in this video,
I want to propose a system for you
being able to package up this information
in a valuable way
that can genuinely help other people
a way to use information for good while
opening up the potential
for more opportunities with other people
to profit from, to make a living from
and I don't really
I don't think
to me
there's not really
a better business model. Right.
It sounds weird
because the information
business is so new,
but we just talked about
how everything is information and how
the only goal that people
want to achieve
is a higher quality of life,
a higher quality of human experience.
And it's not like you have to go
and build a mega corporation
in order to achieve that experience.
That's all we want.
If we were at peace
and we were living perfect lives,
then we wouldn't
want more and more and more.
So if we can get more people
to the self, actual,
self-actualized and self
transcended stage of Maslow's
hierarchy of needs,
we'd be in a lot better spot
because it's like
information
allows people to do more things.
If I had the right information,
I could go and build whatever
I want to build, right?
But someone has to build it before me
and teach me how to do it
or I have to do it myself.
But if I'm busy doing my own thing,
then I'm going to have to
go to someone else for that information.
Am I saying everyone's going to do this?
No.
Am I saying that you can?
Yes, because there is a small fraction
of the human population
watching this video
and there's even an even smaller
fraction of people
that are actually interested
in this stuff.
And just for a bit of credibility,
I want to give a Cliff Notes
version of my back story.
I've talked about it before
and I'll have to come back and
create a better video of my entire story.
But in a nutshell,
I tried so many different things.
I tried a bunch of different
business models.
I failed at them
because I didn't know what I was doing.
I didn't have
the compounded knowledge
and experience to actually make it work.
I lost a bunch of money
trying to make those businesses work.
I ended up getting a job
as a web designer,
and then I took what I learned there
and what I had previously experienced
through my failures
and started freelancing
with web design and funnels.
And then three years ago
is when I started my creative journey
on Twitter of all places and so on.
Twitter, I began to kind of pivot
my freelance service.
I created my first info product,
and then I ended up
creating three info products
within a year.
And then at this point,
I also pivoted my freelance service
to be more consulting for creators.
So rather than web design and funnels
for service businesses, it was
funnel consulting or just
like marketing offer creation
and consulting for service
based creators.
And so then
in the second year
I was profitable
with all of these thankfully,
and I was growing on social media
and I decided
I wanted to start a community
Modern Mastery, many of you know of it,
but I bundled up the courses
that I had already created
and I put them inside there as bonuses
and as like a launch thing.
This is a very important point.
So now finally, in my third year,
I created after a long story
of losing my phone
after a night, getting drunk
and driving back home in the car.
I had a bunch of ideas
and I ended up recreating
my entire offer.
STACK So now it's Modern Mastery,
two hour writer, course, a cohort, and
that's it.
And then the lead magnet.
So seven days to genius
ideas is
my note taking system that's valuable.
And so there's two lessons here, right?
Is that one
I feel pretty fucking qualified
to talk about and teach about this stuff
I've made six figures in my first year
with info products
and then I've made it with consulting,
I've made it with freelancing,
I've made it with almost
every I've made six figures with
almost every online business offer
there is done for you, done with you,
do it yourself.
Info products,
consulting, coaching, freelancing.
All of the above.
And so the second point is
where a lot of people kind of go wrong,
where they feel like
they shouldn't build at the start
or until they build an audience
when I'm a proponent of
building immediately
because I learned this through experience
where every single product I built,
even the two that just failed miserably
and I stopped selling like a week
after starting to sell them
is that I was able
that had ordered information
that I could use elsewhere.
I got bad ideas out of my head.
Not bad as in like bad,
but like bad as in un validated.
And they just didn't
resonate with people.
I got those out of my head
and I was able to build on top of them.
It was like clearing my mind
and freeing new way
to build on top of that
and understand things deeper.
Because the three info products
that I created the first year
and I didn't see going anywhere,
I didn't just get rid of them.
Right, because there's still value there.
There was still a lot of value.
So I packaged them up
and I created a new offer out of it.
And now
Modern Mastery
has been going for two years strong.
So in essence, your first product
that we're going
to be talking about building,
it's going to suck.
You just have to get it out
and you have to iterate
and build on top of it.
There's a quote from Nouvel
where it's like,
it's not 10000 hours,
it's 10,000 iterations.
So you just have to build,
build, build, build, build.
Now let's talk
about how to extract the value
that you have stuck in your brain.
Brand is what you do.
Product is how you do it.
Marketing is why you do it.
Do something that improves
your quality of life,
teach others
how you did it, and show them
why they should care.
So in previous videos
we talked about the one person business
model, the rise of the value creator,
and then a few others
revolving around business.
Now those did pretty well.
I feel like most of you are here
because of those videos,
and so that's why I'm making this one
and that's why
I'm going to be making more
to Dove deeper into certain aspects
of those letters,
to give you
a holistic view
on this whole one person,
business model or creator thing
from my lens,
because I feel like I have
a unique way of going about it
that makes it easier for people
to actually start
and take action
and not worry
so much about having
X amount of experience.
So in this video
I want to talk about
how you can ideate the perfect product
while doing what you enjoy in life,
or just improving yourself in general,
improving your life.
So if your personal brand revolves around
what you do,
then your product revolves around
how you do it.
And so with branding a brand,
it has a goal.
It has something that you're
leading people towards, right?
And so your brand in
this case
is what you are doing on a daily basis
that is going to
get you towards that goal.
And now how you do it
is the system, method or process
that you used to get better results
for yourself
or something that you built for yourself
to do what you do better.
And this comes from experience
and experimentation.
So I sold a how to freelance for web
designer product
because I made six figures
about freelancing with web design, right?
And so that only made sense
that I knew how to do that.
I had my own specific processes
for landing clients,
for onboarding those clients,
for doing the project management
for those clients.
And it would make sense
for me to put that in the course
to help other people do it better.
And so Modern Mastery,
I built the community
as if it were something
that I would have used
when I was at the start of my journey.
So I turned like a part of it
into having daily reminders to knock out
your priority tasks
at a strategy library.
We've done
like habit challenges
and other things like that,
and so now I also sell a writing product
because what I do
in order to clear my mind,
have a better future for myself, unlock
more career opportunities as I write
every single morning,
not only to grow on social media,
but to network with other people
and to just journal.
And I had built a 500,000 plus
audience across
different social media platforms
with a two hour writing habit a day
and so when I was building that audience,
I was creating newsletters,
I was writing tweets,
I was creating Instagram posts,
and I had learned a lot of things
that I was directly applying
to what I'm doing.
So I had a better way of doing it.
So the how I do
it is different from other people's
because I had my own
specific templates
for I created my own specific templates
for writing my newsletters,
for writing my tweets
and making it easier on myself
so I could systemize those things
and do them better.
And so in the case of something else
like fitness,
there's people that sell minimalist
training programs
and are just raking in the cash
because if they aren't super into fitness
like a bodybuilder
and they don't want to train
five, six, seven days a week,
instead they want to train
two days a week.
So they do their research,
they experiment,
and they create a training program
that gets them results.
It would only make sense
that they help other people do that,
other people that are like them
because you are the niece.
And so helping those other people
with the system
you created,
like being in the gym for 2 hours a week
and still getting these kinds of results,
that's unique.
And the marketing
is laid out for you already.
Just because you're doing it
in a way that you like,
you'd be able to market
it towards yourself.
You'd be able to give people the why,
because marketing is why you do it.
And so the why behind
like a minimalist
training program would be
I only have
2 hours a week to train in the gym.
I still want to be fit,
I still want to be healthy.
I still want to work on my business,
right?
The marketing plays itself
out for a person
that is very similar to you.
So in summary,
everyone that has productize
themselves has done three things.
One, they improve their quality of life
through personal
and professional development.
Two, they learn necessary
skills and interests along the way
to increase their quality of life.
Three, They started posting online
regardless of how basic
they thought their information was.
So here are three questions
that you can ask yourself to brainstorm
a profitable product idea.
So one is
what is the highlight of your day?
Is it writing? Is a yoga?
Is it going to the gym?
What is seamless
for you to do and learn about right?
Or What do you do for work?
Is there something that you are
very good at
that you'd be able to teach other people?
Is there something that you have done
that you may not
think is impressive,
but like you're
the only one that thinks
that is impressive
or you're so like immersed
in a specific community of people
that have done that same thing
that you think is just normal in that
everyone has done that.
And so a question about that.
The second one,
which is what do you do
better than your peers or
what do you do better than most people
is just that.
And the way you can kind of test
this is by how you justify
you doing that.
Like Chris Bromstad, who's a mr.
Olympia competitor,
he mentioned one time
that he had to give up the normal life
so he could
stay home and cook healthy meals
or not go out and drink
and be tempted by junk food
because he had a mission
or a goal that he was so dead
set on achieving
with a specific skill set of his
that his friends didn't get it.
But he knew that it was going
to lead to something great.
So if there is something like that
in your life
that you are genuinely obsessed with,
why would you not turn it into something
that you can help other people do
that are like you?
So the third way to brainstorm
a product idea is to look at who
you follow and what they sell.
Because I'm assuming
that you follow people
that you're interested
in following, right?
You're learning something
from some people.
If you're watching this video,
you're more on like
I get on social media to be educated
rather than entertained mainly.
And so I guarantee that there are people
selling something, right?
So if you like self-improvement
and you like
online business
and you want to do something like that,
then go and deconstruct
my landing pages, go look at my emails,
go look at all the things that I'm doing
and deconstruct it
and figure out how
you can reverse engineer
and kind of emulate that.
And it goes for anything.
If you are very big into fitness
and you follow a lot of fitness people,
what are they all doing
that allows them to do that full time?
And so the bonus number for
for those who haven't started,
if you haven't started,
you have to be decisive.
Pick a path
that slightly interests
you and just start
because that will get you to the point
of knowing so much faster
than procrastinating.
Like it doesn't matter
if you don't know what you're doing,
it doesn't matter anything.
Just continuously learn and build
according to what you're learning.
Watch the last video
on how I remember everything.
I learn to understand that more.
So here's a graphic
as we always do at the top,
we have knowledge and experience
a.k.a information or valuable information
in this case. Right.
That you attain
through the journey of self-actualization
isn't it
isn't once
you self-actualize, it's along the way
and documenting your journey.
And then from that
you break it down into your brand,
your product,
and your marketing with what you do,
how you do it, why you do it.
And then that equals
a one person business or self.
Monetization is just a way
of framing your knowledge and experiences
online in the form of brand product
content
with consistent effort
to put your name out there
and build your own public resume.
That's what matters.
And so I want to reiterate
in what I talk about.
I'm not talking about B2B info
products, I'm not talking about business
to business.
I'm talking about product
sizing yourself,
treating yourself as the niche,
writing to yourself, building to yourself
and monetizing that way.
And now
a lot of traditional marketers
don't like that approach.
And I can tell you,
just from my results alone
and the people,
the big players
that reach out to me
asking how to do the same,
that it doesn't have to be as complicated
as the copywriters and marketers
and salesmen make it seem,
because I've done all of that,
I've done all of that,
and it's always
sounds weird to say it this way,
but I'm making ten times more that
than I was
by trying
to follow the copy
and sales hacks out there.
Just being authentic
with that skillset,
like still using that skillset
to create compelling
social media posts and sales pages.
That's good.
But from an authentic lens
and talking to a target customer
that I know well.
And so one crucial point here
is that when you are building,
it has to be done in public,
you have to be posting,
you have to be building,
you have to be publishing,
you have to be launching
because you need data.
We're talking about
giving out valuable information here
and you need data to know
if the information is valuable or not
because starving artists,
it's in the name.
Starving artists
like to create
what they think is valuable
and they get attached
to their version of value.
And then they wonder like, okay,
why am I not selling anything?
This this painting is beautiful.
And like, nothing against that.
If you want to do it as a hobby,
that's great.
But if you want to do it as
a full time thing, then you're going
to have to
play a back
and forth game with the market.
Because again, like another
big good reason behind
this is that you're trying
to improve people's lives, right?
That's a good reason behind this.
You're trying to improve people's lives.
And if you're putting out these things
that people aren't buying
and they're not going through
and they're not reading
and you can't hold their attention,
is it really valuable?
Like if it's not getting results,
then you're just going
to have a bad time.
So you have to iterate and pivot.
So let's dove in and let's break
this all down into seven steps.
On how to create a profitable
information product
with the knowledge in your head.
The first one, which is a given
but it needs to be stated,
is to become above
average intellect, skills or interests.
Motivation gets you into this game.
Learning is what helps
you continue to play.
Creativity is how you steer.
Flow is how you turbo boost the results
beyond all rational standards
and reasonable expectations.
Stephen Cutler
So we've discussed this many times before
and I feel like
many of you are already
studying and learning
and practicing skills or interests.
And so here's something that just most
people don't want to hear.
If you aren't getting results
or you aren't making money
or you've been putting in effort
for a long time,
it's still a skill problem.
It's because you aren't skilled enough.
You haven't put in enough time
in the right direction
with getting the right data
and iterating to the point
of knowing what actually gets results
with that skill.
Because someone asked me on social media
the other day like, Hey,
why I've been doing everything
that the social media growth
people say to do.
I've been doing all the fundamentals,
but why am I not growing?
And it's
because it's a skill problem,
because on social media,
the common advice is like comment
on big accounts,
dumb people and things like that.
But if you aren't seeing results,
it's usually because you aren't
seeing the missing piece
in the skill set
that's going to make it work.
Is it
you're messaging like
if you're
not very good at speaking English,
is that your English?
Do you need to touch up on that?
Like another weird
thing is like on Twitter,
like do you put a space
before your punctuate
when writing
write like how people sometimes write
like a question mark
with a space before it.
And I know that's like a common thing
for a lot of people,
but when you're doing it
in a professional manner online
and trying to make an income from it,
it's just not going to cut it.
You have to have like good grammar.
And so that's
those are just a few examples,
but there may be something
that you are missing in the skill
that is preventing you
from getting results.
So step number two
is to build something
with those skills every single day.
So we talked about this
in the last video,
so I'll keep this brief, but
you learn more when you build and learn
to apply
to what you're building,
and then you teach
to fill in the knowledge gaps or identify
the knowledge gaps you have
and fill that fill in the blanks
with learning.
And so if you're learning marketing,
then build a brand or practice
on a portfolio piece
or just practice for do a permanent
permissionless apprenticeship
where you create
something, let's say like a website
for your favorite brand,
you can send it to him, sure,
but you can also just do it for practice.
Now, of course,
my favorite way of doing this
as a personal brand,
because you can create your own website,
you can write your own content,
you can create your own email list,
you can write your own emails,
you can design your own profile
picture, design your own banner.
There is a plethora
of the most high value skills
that you can learn and apply
to a personal brand.
So number three is document
your learnings, findings or results.
So my favorite way to think of
this is to just think of social media
as a public note taking software,
a public journal in a public school.
Because when I'm creating these or
when I'm writing
a newsletter or something like that,
I have everything on Twitter, right?
I can do Twitter advanced search
and I can just look up the word valuable
from any of my tweets,
and then I just have stuff to go off of.
So it's a note taking system,
it's a journal,
because I can put my thoughts,
my relatable
thoughts and worries
and ideas and other things like that.
And it's just good to practice writing.
Okay.
Now, step number four is very important,
and that is to experiment
for holistic understanding.
And so I've always loved doing things
my own way and my own way
is implementing
the best teachings from various sources
until I have
a better way of doing it
or a unique way of doing it.
So fitness being an example is that
I used someone's initial program
like strong lifts five
by five to get into the gym
and start lifting.
But then I studied someone
like Greg
Gallagher, who only trains 2 to 3 days
a week, very different training style.
And then I tried Wendler 531,
which is powerlifting,
and then I've tried
like super high volume
bodybuilding splits.
And with that
I have so much different data
and I understand that there are
billions of different ways
to go about getting one specific result
and that if I can find a way
that I genuinely enjoy doing myself,
create my own program for me,
I could go and package that up
and sell it to someone else.
I could probably plug it in this video
and make a decent income.
Maybe if I like took off my shirt
and marketed myself
and like my fitness stuff a bit more
I could because I'm a personal brand.
That's why I like them
so much is that they're so
dynamic, right?
I don't have to stick to a specific niche
if I don't want to, as long as I make
my interests interesting to you.
And so the same thing goes with diet.
It's like I've tried
if it fits your macros,
I've tried ancestral stuff,
I've tried veganism, I've tried keto,
and from those I get something new
every single time, right?
So me
trying Greg do sets diet
where it's low calorie dense foods.
I really enjoyed
his anabolic French toast,
so I eat that quite a bit.
But on the ancestral side of things,
it's like
while I know that
all liver is very nutrient dense,
so I'm going to incorporate that somehow.
And the same thing
with like ground beef
and eggs and other things.
And I gain this big picture understanding
that allows me
to create ten times
more valuable information
than the people
that are just trapped in one ideology.
The future belongs to those
that can deliver holistic, nuanced,
but yet interesting information
to other people
that is valuable
in this upcoming century.
And so this
is the way of the synthesizer or
it is the career path,
as we talked about, for self
improvers or polymaths.
It's a way to study
all angles
of one of your specific interests
or multiple interests
and talk about your findings,
the things that are valuable
there, the signal among the noise.
So I like to think of
creators as ideas or idea junkies
because deejays or disc junkies,
Z junkies or jockeys,
I think it's junkies. Disc junkies.
They do exactly what creators do.
But with music.
So electro
EDM or electronic dance music
is something that's relatively new,
but new genres and subgenres
are being created every single week.
Like there are just so many.
And you don't find that
in like traditional music.
This is what technology has opened for
human beings, is the ability
to be infinitely creative,
because in regular music
you have like jazz,
R&B, country,
rock and roll, other things like that.
But then in EDM
or electronic dance music,
you have like rhythm zaps step, dubstep,
grime step.
Like all of these different things
which are slightly
different from each other.
They're just minor distinctions
between the two,
but that's how people separate themselves
from the crowd.
That's how people stand out
because they have the technology
to do so.
You have the information available to you
to become an idea
junkie and synthesize
an entire philosophy of your own
into Internet content.
So ideas are the sounds,
and then when you mix them together,
the content are the songs.
So create your mix,
play it loud, and attract an audience.
So step number
five is to iterate on your process
for efficiency and results.
So once you have
once you've been doing this right,
you've been pursuing your goals
for a better life,
you've encountered problems,
you're learning the skills
to overcome them
like you want to make more money.
So you learn marketing
and you start freelancing
or restart an agency
or start a personal brand
and you get results.
You usually have the information
to create your own process
for replicating those results, right?
If I want to be productive
every single morning,
then I need to sit down
and I need to write down my three
priority tasks
and I need to remind myself of my vision
for my future. I need to
close all my browser tabs
and other things in business.
These are called SOPs
or standard operating procedures.
So you are going to write down
steps of
how you get to a specific result,
and then you're going to follow that
and you're going to encounter problems
and you're going to be like,
Oh, that could be a bit different.
And then you're going to change that
and make it better
until it is
valuable enough to offer in a product
and create a curriculum around.
So I had an sop for creating websites
for my clients or myself.
I just created steps
and I turned it into a course
and I filmed videos
going over those steps
and talking about the nuances
in to our writer.
My course,
I created a system
that allowed me to write
newsletters that are arguably
more deep and thought
provoking than a are.
A lot are in the creative space, right?
And so that's different, that's valuable.
And people want to learn that.
And so I packaged it up,
I put my system in motion
and I built a curriculum around it,
and now I can sell that.
And it gets people similar results.
And so if you download
any of my products,
even my free products,
you can see this, right?
Deconstruct the landing pages,
like go to the power planner,
see what I promise and see the system
that I created and turned into a planner
for seven days to genius. These are free.
That's how I have creative ideas
through note taking
and I created my own system
from that right.
You can use other people's systems
as inspiration.
I use smart notes in central casting
in order to create
what I call value notes.
And now I'm creating an entire software
around that system that I can sell.
So step number
six is to steal marketing and structure
that already works.
Sell what's already selling.
This is the best
single piece of counterintuitive advice
I've ever received in my career.
I created the two hour writer
because I knew how profitable
the writing niche
was in my little corner of Twitter.
People I knew people that were banking
like two
$3 million a year
from just running a cohort on
basic writing.
They weren't promising
any kind of money, like
it wasn't a make money online product,
it wasn't anything fancy.
It was just learn how to write.
They had a good, compelling
copy in the sales page,
but they were pulling
like 2 to 3 million.
And so I'm like,
I write every single day,
I'm going to get in on this.
And on Black Friday,
I did $130,000 in sales in three days.
And so even with this to
to make it easier on myself,
when I went to go
and create a writing product,
I would go throughout their funnels,
their emails and their landing pages,
and I would take things
like the headlines,
the burning problems
that they talk about,
the offer and the curriculum structure,
the guarantee benefits, ethics
and the rest, the positioning like them
not being
how to make money online with writing.
And so that's just inspiration.
That is so much information
at my fingertips for me to replicate.
Clearly not just copy and paste
because I have my own way of doing it
and I have to articulate that.
But the structure
and the why behind why that works.
And so my first product was an e-book
on how to freelance with web development,
and I created it
because I knew it would sell.
I had personal
he bought a freelancing product before.
I knew
that as a developer
that I was that I loved buying courses.
I could not stop buying courses.
It didn't matter
if it was the same
topic over and over again.
And so that is how I learned that buyers
buy again.
So if I simply put a freelancing product
for web developers
in front of web developers
and it was good,
I knew that I was going to make
at least some form of an income from it,
and then I can iterate and make it better
from there and make more.
And I also knew that most web developers
were buying the courses
on like course platforms like Udemy.
So if I wanted to pull in
an actual sustainable income,
I knew that I would have to create
a personal brand
and sell to my audience
because then I wouldn't
have to deal
with that entire competition.
Then I have a personal monopoly,
which we're going to talk
in two videos from now,
but that's pretty much it.
So step number
seven is to build distribution
and systemize promotions.
So there are a lot of moving
pieces and business brand is one of them.
But you don't have to change that
too much once
you have like your brand,
it's pretty much solidified product.
Yeah, you're going to update it
and you're going to change it
and you're going to iterate a few times.
But it's going to be
like few and far
between compared
to content and promotions.
So content is for building distribution,
an audience, an email list,
a community if you feel like it.
And then marketing is distributing
your product through promotions.
So plugging in your social post,
promoting in your newsletter,
changing up the angle and the messaging
and the only way
you're going to succeed in this great
online game is through
testing, persistence
and iteration, right?
With promotions,
it's kind of obvious
you put out a promotion, let's say
just one time
you choose a specific angle.
So for writing,
I'm like,
Here's a skill
you can learn in your free time,
crappy angle, but whatever.
And let's say it sells X amount
or it sells nothing.
And if it sells nothing,
then I need to dig deeper into that.
Then I look okay.
How many clicks did that get?
How many actually got
to the landing page?
What tweet was out on,
or what was I talking about that day?
And then you can slowly
start to change things up day
after, day after day after day
until you hit this angle
that just sells really well,
and then
you're moving in the right direction.
Then you take that
and you make a spin off of it
because content and promotions
is about saying one validated
valuable thing
1000 different ways
from 1000 different angles.
And so this is why it's a game of time.
And consistency
is because
the first year is
just you're going to hit
wall after wall after
while you're going to fail, fail, fail
unless you have prior experience.
But in 1 to 3 years
and after testing
and iterating so many different times
and just having it solidified
in your head
of what is validated, what is valuable,
and what are the best content
and promotion angles that you can go for.
Then that's just like exponential growth
at that point
because you're consistently putting out
top notch content and promotions.
So you learn to harness
the power of self-awareness
and intuition.
So the caveat here is
that you have to start writing, building
and promoting
and if you're anxious or
fearful about this,
you have to
remember that
the unknown becomes known with time.
If you
it's not really like this,
but if you threw yourself
into the middle of the ocean
and didn't really know how to swim,
if you're able to breathe and live,
you'd eventually learn how to swim.
Write that example,
but you get the point.
And so you'll have to lean into it
at some point,
and it might as well be now.
An autonomous,
profitable and fulfilling
future awaits my friends.
And that is the end of the video.
I hope you like the new mike.
I hope it actually sounds good.
I knew that some of you
were talking about the audio quality,
so we stepped it up.
I hope it sounds good, but either way,
I hope you enjoyed this video.
If you did like subscribe or
leave a comment,
it really helps with the algorithm,
even if it's just like
leaving a comment or
I like
the mic sounds good
or something like that really helps.
And then if you want to
check out the free products,
there are seven days to genius
the power planner in the description.
And then we talked about my products,
this entire video.
So check them out if you like.
But with that, I'll see
you in the next video piece.
