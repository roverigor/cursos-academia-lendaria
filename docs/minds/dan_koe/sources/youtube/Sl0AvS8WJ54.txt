as a kid video games fascinated me i
remember the first time going to
gamestop begging my mom for my first
rated m game which was call of duty
modern warfare which was a hit and
everyone in my age group loved it
everyone was playing it that was my
excuse for getting my mom to buy the
game for me she caved and i spent my
nights chugging dr pepper until 2 am
arguing with kids in the
pre-game lobby just cursing each other
out having an absolutely amazing time
and
it's made me wonder
why
myself and others are so addicted more
so obsessed with video games and other
things in life as time went on i stopped
playing the console games and i ended up
building my own pc that was a fun little
hobby of mine and i played league of
legends and world of warcraft like my
life depended on it i remember coming
back for the summer from college to
lifeguard and at night after my shifts i
would just spend all day in dungeons and
talking to my guild and doing raids in
world of warcraft with my friends now a
lot of people in the self-help space
will tell you to stop playing video
games there is merit behind that but i
don't want to be the guy that tells you
that store
video games have stories there is
something that we can pull from them and
a lot of people that i'm connected with
that are making good money in the
business world attribute most of their
or a lot of their success to video games
they played runescape and world of
warcraft they learned about
skill development skill acquisition
increasing their traits they learned how
to kind of sell things on the open
market they learned how to trade value
and it taught them a lot of business
skills that
could not be learned somewhere else it's
it's quite literally real world
experience interacting with other people
and trading digital currency in this
case with each other and that's what we
do in online business and as we'll talk
about in a bit but
that's what you do so why do people get
obsessed with video games there are a
few reasons one is that the mind craves
order we talk about this a lot ordered
consciousness so the mind tends toward
disorder
it's called entropy that's what happens
when you do not maintain mental order in
your mind via values goals
other things like that that help you
frame your focus towards something
important and kind of block out all of
the distractions that are capturing your
attention you need something important
to focus on so you can
use and channel that energy that isn't
being distracted or stolen from you from
other distractions so the way we order
consciousness in everyday life whether
it be unconscious or conscious
is through a hierarchy of goals we keep
talking about this because it is
important right career paths
corporate culture
society they all have goals for you
political leaders too
there is a desired outcome there's
clarity on how to get there and then
there is an action on your end to kind
of move through that hierarchy of goals
let's take a political leader for
example the desired outcome is for them
to win the election they want to win the
game
so how do they get there a hierarchy of
goals right uh we're going to hit this
milestone of the election we're going to
do this campaign we're going to do this
this and this and this is what you have
to do in order for us to reach those
goals and hit that desired outcome this
reflects in society as well you are told
to
the the end goal the desired outcome is
retirement at 65. the way you get there
is by goal one going to school getting a
job etc etc up until that point that's
how we order consciousness and
have certainty or a sense of certainty
for our future arnold
was obsessed walt disney was obsessed
joe rogan is obsessed elon musk is
obsessed all of our leaders today the
people that you respect and look up to
are obsessed with
achieving some desired outcome via
pursuing a hierarchy of goals now think
do they care what other people think of
them they may they may not it doesn't
really matter at the end of the day but
from our perspective and our perception
no they don't give a they go and do
what they were meant to do because they
have clarity and a sense of certainty
about their future and how to get there
they have somewhere to bring their focus
to now obsession to me signals this
order consciousness that's what it shows
that's how you achieve it that's how you
achieve a flow state that's how you
stop projecting into the predictable
future or the familiar past and bring
yourself into the present moment because
when disorder or chaos takes place
that's when your mind is just the
attention goes anywhere it goes to the
the thought about oh the stressful
future or a thought about a mistake you
made or some kind of failure and it
distracts you and it sucks your energy
and it brings your vibes lower to match
whatever experience you were having at
that time the emotion that was related
to that you are feeling that emotion
right now so a quote from naval ravikont
to make an original contribution you
have to be irrationally obsessed with
something
this is important as we keep talking
about obsession obsession obsession what
do you really want to understand where
is your attention going right now what
are you putting off that you know you
can get obsessed with what are
previous things that you've been
obsessed with that you can dive into
again and reignite that and find a
problem that exists within that area and
work to solve it as your life's purpose
and a quote from justine musk who i
believe is elon musk's wife or something
i don't know exactly who she is but
justine musk has a great quote follow
your obsessions until a problem starts
to emerge a big meaty challenging
problem that impacts as many people as
possible that you feel hell-bent to
solve or die trying so that's good in
itself but i also want to paint more of
a picture around this by introducing
stephen cutler's five intrinsic drivers
the five intrinsic drivers are curiosity
passion purpose autonomy and mastery
these are from his book the art of
impossible i would highly recommend
reading that if you want to follow his
process for actually cultivating these
intrinsic drivers now i had someone in
the modern mastery discord do this the
other day where i wrote a tweet that
said
write out your favorite authors
like five favorite authors and write out
the things that they talk about those
are your interests they are your
interests and now what he did and what i
told him to do to take it a step further
is to
write these interests in a circle right
so it's like
he had like strategy love
uh business something else in a circle
right and then i asked him to connect
the dots
make connections how do those things
intersect and what do you have it and it
was pretty mind blowing i'll throw a
picture up here but
everything connected
every single thing connected
do you know what that means that means
that there are problems that exist there
there in problems and utility is where
that passion is cultivated and that is
also good for the people that are
starting businesses because one content
is a major pillar of business and your
brand is also a major pillar of bris
business what is your niche well it's
unique and you want to stand out from
the crowd so it's where those
intersections are it's how you present
that content and all of those lines can
be a specific content idea or just a way
of delivering your value to the world as
always you don't need to become a fancy
internet entrepreneur to see the value
in posting content online that's where
people are actively hiring
people with the skill sets that are used
online like building a personal website
posting content understanding marketing
building an email list
all of that fun stuff now the thing i
want to bring your attention to here
where there's the five intrinsic drivers
there's curiosity passion purpose i want
to bring your attention to purpose
because purpose your massively
transformative purpose and the thing
that will give you so much energy energy
to just attack your days something that
makes you want to get out of bed in the
morning is having that purpose now
a lot of people think like oh i can't
find my purpose blah blah blah
you're not supposed to find it right
away it's cultivated right you're not
going to understand what the big problem
you want to solve in the world is
by just doing this exercise and not
really taking action or being consistent
with anything and just going back to
scrolling on your phone or whatever it
may be that's keeping you distracted
from actually
actualizing
the life that you want to live so my
purpose i believe or at least how i
would label it is to end human suffering
the way that i'm doing that is by kind
of bridging the gap between the digital
world and the spiritual world i have a
lot of theories on how we are kind of
documenting or building a mind online
the mind or the brain is comprised of
all these neural networks that work in a
specific way the online world is
comprised of a bunch of wires and
networks and block chains some are
material some are immaterial there's
hardware there's software it all makes
sense and it's all connected we there's
only so much we can do
or understand as humans in the material
world and kind of sort it
not really in the immaterial world but
that's what we do there's connections
everywhere there's only a few meta
principles in life that make
everything pretty much the same once you
reach a specific point you start to see
this and that's what i'm trying to help
people reach is one to
fix their money problems their basic
needs
through self-improvement and starting an
online business in a digital economy
that is continuing to grow i think i
talked about this last
video maybe but 60
of new jobs have not been created yet
they haven't been created 60 of new jobs
you don't even know
or you may or may not know what your
future job is going to be
and people creators are out here
creating jobs out of nowhere right
there's like marijuana therapists which
they find people online through content
attract them to their work and take them
on as clients and consult them there's
twitter ghostwriters which has been very
big lately it's pretty much like a
social media marketing agency but for
twitter but they're creating their own
work
because they understand how to deliver
value and how to package things up
in a way that directly impacts a
specific human's experience so when you
find or when you cultivate that
massively transformative purpose or you
have that purpose and you you kind of
understand what it is you don't even
have to label it you just it's an
experience i feel like purpose is an
experience you can't label it you can't
put words on it you just
know and that is when you can bring your
focus to that and the things that drive
that purpose like your business or going
to the gym or other things and improving
your life
that is how
you give yourself something to focus on
and stop caring what other people think
and there is more firepower to this of
course that we will continue to talk
about but i also want to bring in
uh mihai chiksetmihai's flow model that
truly it's extremely powerful if you
understand it so from this graph in the
middle there is the flow channel or as i
painted it it's optimal experience this
to me shows obsession it's ordered
consciousness this is when you know
exactly what you're doing you don't have
to think about what you're doing you
have the intrinsic drivers that are
fueling you in your daily actions and
the if you
if the challenge is too high and your
skill is too low you get anxious you
don't want to it's like in the video
game when i was playing league of
legends if i was a bronze player that's
a rank trying to go against a diamond
player which is a much higher rank it's
going to make me anxious it's not even
going to be fun because i have no way of
competing i have no way or like i have
to think i have to strategize i have to
go crazy and be neurotic about how i'm
going to beat this person and then in
the other side if the challenge is too
low so let's reverse it i'm diamond
they're bronze
if the challenge is too low
and my skill is too high i'm just going
to get bored because i'm going to win
every single time right there's no
challenge there's no battle between the
protagonist and the antagonist of the
story there's no meaning there and so
you can use this as a way to understand
where you are currently at if starting a
business makes you anxious or you don't
know how to do it there's no clarity
there you can't enter flow in order to
build your business and do all this
other stuff it's because you're not
educated enough you don't have the skill
you haven't practiced you haven't
learned the principles or the basics or
the fundamentals of actually starting
that thing it doesn't make sense to you
so you either write it off as a scam or
you're just like oh that's too hard blah
blah blah it's all within your control
you have the internet
for christ's sake like just go and
research how do i start a business buy a
book you it takes time of course to
learn about this stuff it takes four
years to get a degree it's gonna take
you two
to four weeks to understand
uh business stuff in general especially
if especially if you're looking online i
mean i have my school digital economics
which helps people do this in 30 days
link in the description but if you do it
on your own that's also a very rewarding
path
that's how you increase your skill to
match whatever challenge you are trying
to face that's why constant learning and
applying is so important now
let's take this a step up a notch right
we understand ordered consciousness we
understand order of the mind we
understand flow we understand obsession
to an extent and what causes it but now
we need to create our own world create
our own game so our focus is framed or
it is controlled it is in a controlled
environment so we can block out the
distractions that are coming in so i'm
going to throw up a graph now that i
created and will be referencing but it
shows the
general game of life that i'm trying to
paint a picture here you have the
reality you create which is the circle
you have mediocrity insecurity
distractions opinions all bouncing off
of that reality because they can't
permeate it and then you have level one
to level 100 which is your mission
and executing on that specific hierarchy
of goals that will get you to the
desired outcome of getting to level 100.
now i want you to understand that games
are a structured story if you've watched
any of my videos i talk about stories a
lot because that's how we understand
things concepts metaphors stories
understanding what came before in a
linear timeline and what came after
that's what creates my identity
everything that has led up to
who i am now and everything that is
going to come after what am i pursuing
that is what is in the future my happy
ending of the story right now we
understand games we understand that
story or a game is a structured story
that's why we enjoy them
because they present that hierarchy of
goals and the battle and the challenge
and everything else that would result in
a flow state if you're fully focused on
that but you need to understand that
everything is a game me creating this is
a game
i have a structured hierarchy of goals
of how i want this video to go in order
to create the desired outcome of a high
quality video and you can intuit this
right in a game you have a desired
outcome you have goals to get there and
et cetera et cetera you have a storyline
right but how do you play a game
this brings back the flow model that we
talked about earlier you have to learn
the rules the mechanics the principles
you need to understand how to play it
this is why people get so anxious or
stop playing the game early it's because
they don't know how to play it
everything is a game social media growth
is a game it's like oh you don't know
how to grow okay learn until you know
how to grow you don't know how to make
money
learn until you know how to make money
and then you practice and you get better
and eventually
it works because it's possible and other
people are doing it the only thing
that's holding you back is the story
you're telling yourself because you have
a blurred lens of perception because
you're unable to see
how that person got there you're you
don't see the path for them getting that
desired outcome so you tell yourself a
story oh i don't know what's in this
path i don't know what's on the map of
the game i don't i don't know what's
here my mind isn't ordered to understand
that i don't have clarity to get there
so oh no that's not possible oh no
that's a that's a scam all this other
stuff you don't know you're just feeding
yourself a story and
reinforcing
the possibly
 mindset that you have so creating
your own reality creating your own world
that you are going to play this game in
really comes down to perspective and
perception i want you to think of
perspective as we've talked about this
before perspective as
a camera right a camera and a game
that's how you navigate the world that's
your world view that's what you can see
and what you understand and the places
you have awareness of it's the light
areas on the map of it of a video game
the ones you haven't explored yet the
unknown or the dark areas of the map
until you get your camera over there and
gain perspective and are able to gain
accurate and advantageous perception of
whatever situation you're in so you can
leverage that so let's create an example
of this right because it kind it kind of
makes sense where you're creating your
own world and moving the camera around
and changing your perspective zooming in
zooming out whatever it may be but let's
say you are at a coffee shop or just
somewhere right you're out and about and
as we talk about basic needs a lot
because
many people have not met them and
partnership and everything else like
usually people have that sexual desire
to go and talk to women that's a big
problem that people face you can just
look up on youtube and see how many
views the videos have of like oh how to
get a girlfriend how to do this how to
do that and it's like
if you're at let's say you go to a
coffee shop there's a cute girl there
and you're afraid to go talk to her
because you're already telling yourself
a story of what's going to happen you're
already not existing in your own reality
you already have a faulty perspective
and you need to pause and you need to
shift that perspective and see it either
from her angle or for another angle or
you gain meta perspective by zooming out
and seeing the entire situation for what
it is you need to breathe you need to
calm down and pull yourself into the
present moment so then you can create a
reality for yourself so you're not
living in a past or future
reality based on psychological time
where you're pulling from negative
experiences that you've had
feeling that experience in the now and
quite literally becoming a version of
your past self that is not conducive to
the desired outcome of the situation
that you're trying to achieve which is
either getting the girl's number or just
having a good conversation so you catch
yourself asking questions like oh what
if she what if i embarrass myself what
if she has a boyfriend what if she
uh this that another with it what if she
thinks i'm just an idiot well one
zoom out see the perspective what
happens after that nothing you go on
about your day big whoop and this goes
for posting online as well i used to be
afraid of getting in front of a camera a
camera and and posting a video like zoom
out and and
like think about this from a real or
relative truth based perspective i'm in
front of a camera why am i afraid i'm
alone pretty much why why would i be
afraid to talk in front of a camera and
just like put my message out there
posting online i can understand but
still you need to pause breathe and
like see the situation for what it is by
zooming out so you can gain that
advantageous perspective because think
about it right if you're afraid of
posting online i'm assuming that you
don't have
a lot of followers or any for that case
so posting online nobody's even gonna
see it in the first place two if someone
comments on it and makes like a negative
comment okay
 move your perspective again stop
gain meta perspective shift it mold your
mind to understand what they are and
understand that they're not they're
probably having a bad day they probably
don't understand anything you're talking
about and like we talked about here
where if they don't have clarity on the
desired outcome that you're trying to
achieve or just anything that you're
talking about it doesn't make sense to
them here's a very good quote that i
remember where there is no right or
wrong there's sense and there's nonsense
so when people don't have clarity on
something they immediately label it as
wrong because they can't pause and do
what we're talking about here now we
built our world
by
either well one constructing a hierarchy
of goals i talk about this all the time
and it's usually implied by now but
having a vision for your future goals on
how to get there priority tasks in order
to get there we're going to be talking
about this more next week been
developing this crazy theory that isn't
going to be able to be explained in one
video but
uh we'll be talking more about that next
week but that's that's implied and now
being able to shift and mold your
perspective around this little world
that you've created and being able to
zoom out zoom in at will that's we've
created the world right that's our game
that's our map and now the next thing
that you do in a game because the world
is already created you have to create
your own character you have to create a
new
identity for yourself that is conducive
to that desired outcome you need to
change your behavior in accordance with
how you're going to achieve that desired
outcome now i want to start with one of
my favorite quotes that i feel is
misinterpreted all the time by carl jung
it is i am not what happened to me i am
what i choose to become and you can
think of this from a material
perspective where it's like oh yes i'm
who i choose to become i'm going to do
this all the time but think of it from
an immaterial expect perspective where
we've talked about how in psychological
time the predictable future or the
familiar past where when you give
moments of your previous or predictable
future life attention you're kind of
tapping into that energy source and
you're pulling that experience into the
now so you are remaining that person
right you are quite literally having the
same exact sensory experience that you
were in the past if you wake up
immediately and think of how stressful
the work day is going to be you're
experiencing that stress right now you
quite literally are that person from an
immaterial perspective so as we talk
about this
think of it on an experience level not
in like oh yeah i am i am jacked i am
tan i already have it right we're not
looking at like oh am i did i just
immediately turn jacked and tan or
do i am i having that experience that
would come from being jacked in tan
which is the confidence which is the
positive emotions that come with that
and that can be tapped into
instantly so i want you to think about
this and mull over this a bit
is what
character do you want to play in the
story of your life in the game of life
are you conscious of this are you
actively trying to
become that person materially
while already being that person and
embodying that person immaterial
immaterially or experientially now you
also have to take into account the
desired outcome you have to be able to
become like a shape shifter and the
people that say this is weird and you
not being able to kind of
form your character on demand for what
the situation provides are usually
attached to certain aspects of their
identity right that's again you're
projecting or reminiscing on
the past in terms of psychological time
were attached to your identity this is
what
uh
spirituality is very big on is removing
or kind of taking away those attachments
that are causing pain right because it's
it's a reaction it's like if someone
talks bad about say christianity and you
are a christian and you have an
automatic reaction it's because you're
attached to that aspect that doesn't
mean you need to remove it from your
life as a whole it just means that
you need to not be externally attached
to
that specific belief and others opinions
don't
matter because you it's your belief it's
intrinsic it's not extrinsic so think
about it in terms of the situation
whether it be macro so your entire life
or micro who you want to be right now in
this very moment let's say you're going
inside
to talk to your wife and kids
what is the character that is most
conducive to that environment and
achieving the desired outcome that you
want to see in that specific situation
this takes consciousness this takes
awareness this takes being present so
think about it what does the maxed out
version of your character
look like
what traits do they have what skills do
they have what are they doing for work
how do they feel write out the
experience so then you can start to tap
into that experience
how much gold do they want to make so
again what is your vision
what are the hierarchy of goals to get
there and what are the actions that you
can take in order to actualize that
while kind of feeding off of the
experience from that vision to bring
that positive energy and experience into
the present moment so if you were to
imagine a story of your life
being written right now it's being
written
right now mine's being written right now
it's the what i'm saying right now is
being written in quotes in the page of a
book because life unfolds in chapters
and phases it really does you can notice
this if you zoom out and start to
reflect on your life and what has
happened in certain cycles phases or
chapters and now think of it this pulls
you into the present moment where
what am i doing right now that is
conducive to growth and a lot of people
think like oh i need to be taking action
and all this other stuff no being
present is conducive to growth you can
sit there and be bored and just focus on
your breath and that is a very
useful thing to do and so what story
was written or may be written when
you're at that coffee shop and you're
afraid to ask that girl out
what story is gonna be written
if it was a bad story and let's say you
lost to the antagonist then are you
gonna redeem yourself are you going to
go back up that rising action and are
you going to win the battle and have
some meaning or interest in your life
and then come down and have that happy
ending or what is going to happen be
conscious of this now i want to
reiterate that
you're always playing a game everything
is a test
everything think of it that way
everything's a test how are you going to
react to the situations that are
presented to you on a moment
moment-to-moment basis and with this all
you can't really opt out of the game of
life until you either win it or reach
the max level
or you do something else that takes you
out of the game of life but in terms of
winning at the game of life you have to
get to a very high level do you know why
because in a video game when you get to
let's say level 99 and things just
everything becomes easy for you you get
to choose your challenge you get to
choose the skill you want to play at and
you get to operate within that realm
it's like in world of warcraft when i
played when you reach max level you
unlock so many other things that just
aren't available to the lower levels you
can fly anywhere across the map you can
take on any challenge imaginable you can
have fun you can you've kind of break
broken out of the trap and if you want
to think of this in terms of maslow's
hierarchy of needs or self-actualization
it's hitting those levels or kind of
fulfilling those levels and then you're
at a place where you can either start to
work towards self-transcendence or you
can just have fun and play the game and
break the rules to your will because you
understand how to navigate it so
effectively so that is it for this video
