#  Pieces Of A Personal Brand  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my
favorites")

Traditional brands are boring, static, and slowly losing trust from the
general population.

People crave human connection and authenticity now more than ever.

Tell me, who would you rather buy from?

The best-selling generic amazon cutting board?

Or a hand-crafted cutting board from someone you follow online and whose
content you can't get enough of?

If money isn't an issue and you are genuinely interested in buying a cutting
board — you will be happy paying a premium for the story that the cutting
board holds.

This is a weird example, but it stands true for everything.

Would you rather buy ground beef from mass production sold at a store?

Or buy from your local farmer? Or the dude who runs a farm that has a personal
brand? Even Butcher Box is more intimate than the meat you pick up at the
store.

 _Intimacy, depth, and personality is what gives you a competitive edge over
companies with 100's of employees and billions of dollars to throw around._

 **Creating A Customer Avatar With Ease**

In traditional branding, people create a customer avatar in order to
understand _who_ they are creating content, products, and marketing strategies
for.

You can find templates for these online (which are worth filling out,
especially when it comes to marketing a product — which we will do in the
Master's curriculum).

Most of those templates ask questions like their age, interests, other
demographics, where they can be found hanging out online, their favorite
quotes, and other things that help you understand that person.

The most important aspect of a buyer persona is a list of problems that keep
them up at night.

For personal branding, your customer avatar is you.

The problems you are solving with your content and products are your problems.

By getting in touch with yourself and cultivating self-awareness, you have all
of the marketing firepower you need (if you aren't overthinking things).

With a personal brand, **you are attracting people that vibe with your
message, interests, and expertise** (while still persuading them that those
things are important in terms of their quality of life).

 **A strong personal brand is the best USP** (unique selling proposition) and
is what will have people buying from you over a competitor (among other
things, of course).

If you are selling a product or service to someone specific (like web design
to local businesses) then yes, you will have to create a separate customer
avatar to market effectively towards that person.

Yes, you can have multiple customer avatars that you want to target.

Yes, you can have a personal brand based on _you_ as the customer avatar while
selling something for another customer avatar. Brand and advertising can be
separate.

The good thing is that there is a website that will generate _your_ customer
avatar for you and help you understand yourself on a deeper level.

[ **Take the MBTI personality test here.**](https://www.mbtionline.com/)

This test will give you a deeper understanding of yourself, help you become
aware of your problems, and give you ample firepower for _who you are writing
content for._

__

Attract The People You Can Help The Most

The people that you can help the most are ones that have similar interests and
goals. You will be the one that exposes them to other related interests and
goals.

Your content (and potentially your products) should all target this specific
person's problems and aspirations.

**The Key To Building A Leverageable Brand**

I want you to start thinking of your brand on a longer time scale.

1 tweet does not display the depth behind your brand.

1 newsletter does not display the depth behind your brand.

Neither do a week of tweets or a month of newsletters.

 **Your content over a 6-12 month timeframe is what determines your followers'
perception of you.**

It is very rare for somebody to go from non-follower to die-hard fan in
anything less than a month.

During those 6-12 months, we need to be sure we touch on 3 pillars for what I
call Social Leverage.​​​​​​​

![](https://d1aettbyeyfilo.cloudfront.net/powershift/28734217_1655126401NW4Social_Leverage.png)

If you have high social leverage (you are covering all 3 bases) then you will
open yourself up to more opportunities.

A brand with high social leverage is noticeable.

I would like to think that my social leverage score is high.

I can DM almost anyone and immediately be taken seriously.

I can close more clients because of how they perceive me. I can get on big
podcasts just by asking. I can use my leverage on Twitter to exchange value
with someone who has leverage on Instagram and have them help me grow. Same
goes with LinkedIn or any other platform.

Once you build social leverage on one platform (like Twitter) you can transfer
it over to others 10x easier. All you have to do is reach out to someone on
that platform, tell them you have X amount of followers and useful strategies,
and they'll help you grow.

Plus, you'll already have validated content ideas that you can transfer over
and use to grow quickly.

The list of benefits goes on and on.

Of course, it will take time to build this leverage as a beginner — but it
helps to zoom out and view it from a point of long-term leverage over the
perspective of short-term money or virality.

An account that only focuses on one of these pillars (like a quotes account,
theme account, meme account, or super niche account based on one skill) will
not have these same opportunities. They will more than likely be ignored in
the DMs are struggle to make an income for themselves.

(There are caveats to all of this, super niche accounts can make good money,
but do they enjoy the entire process? Are they able to talk about things that
give them energy and fulfillment? Or do they have to stick to a script?)

If you only go deep into productivity as an example and don't talk about
yourself, your interests, or your accomplishments — **you won't have as much
leverage as the account that cultivates all 3 pillars of social leverage.**

The 3 pillars that need to be solidified in your brand over 6-12 months are
growth, authority, and authenticity.

 **1) Growth**

It should be obvious that if your brand isn't growing (in followers or
newsletter subscribers) something needs to change in your strategy.

There is _always_ something you can do to grow faster (you just may not have
the specific knowledge to do so yet and need more practice).

The main thing that will determine growth is your content and top-of-funnel
socials (like Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn).

  * Is your content being shared?
  * Will your content make people **click on your profile** and wonder "Who is this guy?"
  * Is your content polarizing due to speaking with confidence on the subject at hand?

Other brand touchpoints play a role in this as well. Optimizing for growth in
your content, profile, and replies will do you well. We will be doing this
over the coming sections.

If you aren't growing, you may need to play to the algorithm a bit more. Study
what kind of content is doing well, incorporate that into some of your tweets,
and be sure it is getting shared by your connections (I will show you how to
leverage other accounts and grow fast when we discuss content).

 **2) Authority**

Authority comes down to 2 things: **depth and social proof.**

 **Depth** = a deep understanding of one area of interest where you can create
unique perspectives and compelling arguments for specific problems.

 **Social proof** = credentials, titles, niche accomplishments, testimonials,
and other things that display your authority in a space.

When you are just starting out, you won't have much authority. This is fine.
Your job will to be establish authority fast.

 **3) Authenticity**

Authenticity comes from:

  * Documenting projects that you are working on. Everything is a project if you want it to be. Your mental, physical, spiritual, and financial development can all be spun into lessons for those that are 2-3 steps behind you.
  * Expressing opinions, likes, and dislikes to relate with those in your audience
  * Being vulnerable — but not in a pitiful way. Be vulnerable by talking about your losses and what you plan to do differently.

All of these should naturally fall into place over time. Everything you learn
in this course are built around those pillars.

__

All Of These Intersect

If you are just starting out — or have yet to establish authority — that will
be the first thing you focus on. A mixture of growth and authority is a great
place to focus for beginners.

Once you've established authority you can easily pivot (since the content and
other free information you've created to build that authority will be up
forever).

**Other Aspects Of A Compelling Brand**

Here are a few other things I want you to keep in mind while creating your
brand.

As you are creating all of these, be sure to emulate the profile pictures and
overall branding of the accounts you aspire to be like (we will write these
down in the next module).

 **1) Visual Storytelling**

Have you ever come across a social media account and you instantly hold them
in high regard? It's because of their branding, visuals, and vibe they are
putting off.

  * Is their profile picture giving off warmth? Confidence? Is it welcoming? Intimidating? Feminine? Masculine?
  * What colors are they using? What emotions do those colors represent?
  * Start studying people's accounts from both the written and visual perspective — how does their branding make you _feel_?

Colors and image composition should always be taken into account when creating
your profile picture, header images, and other brand assets.

All of those should reflect the mood, tone, and "vibe" you are trying to give
off.

If you want to self-educate as you build your first project (your profile)
here are some resources.

[Color theory](https://webflow.com/blog/color-theory) — to understand and
create your own color palette.

[Choosing a brand font ](https://venngage.com/blog/brand-fonts/)— to choose a
font that resonates with your audience.

[Design principles](https://99designs.com/blog/tips/principles-of-design/) –
to understand what makes visual designs pop.

[Image composition](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-
solutions/11-thoughts-introduction-photographic-
composition#:~:text=Elements%20of%20composition%20are%3A%20patterns,that%20works%20for%20your%20image.)
— so you can direct attention with your visuals.

[Profile picture composition](https://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/perfect-profile-
pictures-9-tips-plus-some-research/) — to create a profile picture that gives
off the vibe you want.

[How to take a headshot with your phone](https://headshots-inc.com/blog/how-
to-take-professional-headshots-at-home/) — to understand lighting and making
due with what you have.

From those, you can research how to edit the style that you want to.

 **Side note:** most of those resources talk about traditional branding. With
a personal brand, you can usually get away with choosing colors and fonts that
_you_ vibe the most with. As you are attracting people that have similar
interests as you.

I have always been a fan of black, white, a neon color, and the Montserrat
font — so I exclusively use those for my brand and people associate those with
me.

How are you capturing and directing attention with your visuals?

Understanding this will also help you understand why certain Tweets are
structured in certain ways — they help guide the reader down the page to the
next step (like engagement or clicking a link).

Remember, this course is about implementing systems. All of the necessary
fundamentals you need to learn are available for free online (and they are
easy to find).

Start creating your profile and use the resources above to practice iterating
and making it better.

 **2) Your Hero's Journey**

Every great brand has a backstory.

You have a backstory (whether you know it or not).

You do not have to worry about this until later — but plant this seed in your
head.

If you want to connect with your audience on a deeper level, consistently
talking about your story is a great way to do that.

[Here's an example of mine.](https://thedankoe.com/i-failed-at-7-online-
business-models-and-turned-it-into-a-full-time-creative-income/)

 **3) A brand vision, mission, and goals.**

All great brands have a vision for how they want to impact the world (how they
are going to solve a big problem in the world.

I will save you the pain of reading about this as we will be writing this all
out in the coming sections.

Gain Every Advantage You Can

Most people that start on social media pay zero attention to their actual
brand. Most social media guides focus solely on content.

If you can create _depth_ behind your brand with everything we just talked
about — you gain a competitive advantage even over people with the best
content.
