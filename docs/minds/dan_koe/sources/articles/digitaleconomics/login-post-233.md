#  The Evergreen Content Style  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my
favorites")

People. Love. Lists.

Lists lists lists.

They just work every single time. Especially for those just starting out.

Lists have to be the one style of content that will never go out of style. You
find them everywhere.

If you can’t think of something to post — a list will do the trick (and can be
created from almost any word or idea you can think of.

Example:

A random word that I’m thinking of right now — “Responsibility”

(This can be as simple as writing a word related to your interest, or you
could pull inspiration from the Viral Idea Generation section)

Now brainstorm some sentences that come to mind (by asking what, how, and
why):

  * Responsibility is the difference between a victim mindset and growth mindset. (What)
  * How do you cultivate responsibility? (How)
  * Personal responsibility is an important trait. (Why)

We could turn all of these into their own list tweet, but lets combine them
all in one:

> The difference between a victim and growth mindset is responsibility.
>
> You cultivate it by:
>
> \- Putting in effort
>
> \- Accepting blame
>
> \- Responding not reacting
>
> \- Not taking things personally
>
> \- Knowing that you control your fate
>
> Given time, personal responsibility will give you a sense of control and
> abundance in your life.

  

This could be better, but that took a minute or two. We can come back and edit
this whenever we want to make it more concise.

If you haven’t noticed this yet, I intentionally designed the tweet in a way
that catches readers’ attention, leads them down the page, and leaves them no
option but to engage.

We’ve worked in a few things into one tweet — a transformation, comparison,
how-to, and opportunities to turn every one of those bullet points into their
own tweet or list.

Lists are an all-around incredible way to start diving deeper into your
specific interests, finding what to learn next, and developing your skill in
that area through writing & execution.

 **Repurposing Your List**

Now that we have a list, we can repurpose it into any length of content
imaginable.

If you post it first, you can gauge if the engagement is good or not to see if
you want to repurpose it into more content.

 **1) Add it as a section of your newsletter.**

You can craft a story around the topic of responsibility and end your
newsletter with the list we created earlier.

Let’s say we follow a general copywriting framework — AIDA

A = attention

I = interest

D = desire

A = action

The newsletter subject line should catch **attention** (you can research
Medium or YouTube titles about “responsibility” to brainstorm a subject line).

For **interest** , we can tell a short story about a time in our lives where
taking responsibility led to a beneficial outcome.

For **desire** , we can dive into the benefits of personal responsibility.

For **action** , you can include the steps in the list we created above and
add nuance to each section.

It can be as simple as that.

 **2) Turn it into a list thread on Twitter.**

List threads have been going nuts lately. This is low hanging fruit for
beginners to get their first 1000 followers or so. Just beware, don’t get
addicted to virality. You still have to incorporate the other social leverage
pillars: authority and authenticity.

Pumping out list threads will help you grow fast, but you need other content
in place to nurture your audience and educate them on your expertise.

If you spent some time on the action part of the newsletter, you should be
able to just copy and paste that into a scheduler like TweetHunter. After a
few edits, it will be good to go.

If the thread is the right size, it can be copy / pasted onto LinkedIn and
formatted into a carousel on Instagram.

Of course, plug the newsletter at the end to get some email subscribers.

 **Why Do Lists Work So Well?**

Notice how I’m ending this post with a “why” so you are persuaded to start
writing lists? ;)

You may not have been sold on lists yet, but the benefits of lists (the “why”
or emotion behind the subject) may persuade you to use them more.

Lists work well for a few reasons:

 **1) Every bullet point gives the reader a reason to engage.**

Think about the list tweet we wrote above. If the reader agrees with any of
those points, they should like, comment, or share. If they like multiple
points — they are even more likely to engage.

If they disagree with one of the points, good, they will let you know in the
replies because people can’t help themselves. You will still get more
engagement and reach.

 **2) They catch attention.**

Lists and numbers make people stop and read.

This is true for tweets, bullet points in your sales copy, or anywhere else
(like I’m writing these steps out right now).

 **3) They can be repurposed over and over.**

A list tweet can be posted and validated based on how much engagement it gets.
If it does well, you can turn it into a thread and be confident that it will
do even better (and lead to more followers and email subscribers.

Every other content format on other platforms favor lists. Instagram carousels
will show back up in users’ timelines. If they don’t swipe to the next post,
it will automatically show the second slide the next time they scroll on the
timeline — increasing your chances of getting likes, comments, or shares.

I don’t want you to become overly reliant on lists — but they should play a
crucial role in your growth strategy — which is one of the 3 social leverage
pillars.

If you aren’t growing consistently, incorporate more lists.

 **Once every day or two is a good metric.**

Delete for good?

No, keep it

Yes, delete
