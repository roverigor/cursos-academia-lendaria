#  The Epistemic Method  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Add to my favorites")

The Epistemic Method is a fancy way of saying The Scientific Method — but for
your knowledge.

That is what we are as _unique_ creators — Knowledge Workers that package up
their findings and put them out in the world in the form of content, videos,
audio, books, and other forms of media.

Remember: cognitive, mental, or intellectual development is necessary if you
want your work to evolve over time. By doing this on a consistent basis, you
are developing your mind.

If you want to be truly creative, you need a lot of information to pull from.

If you want a lot of information to pull from, you need to consistently expose
yourself to new information (you need to expand your awareness / consciousness
by pursuing your curiosity).

You need a mental (or digital) database of validated ideas that you can treat
as digital legos for piecing together compelling content.

The traditional scientific method is used to make new discoveries through
testing, experimentation, and iteration on the data you receive.

With the “Epistemic Method” we will be focused on a few things:

  *  **Observation** — you need to observe every aspect of your life and the information you are consuming. Note ideas that come to mind.
  *  **Research** — you must research for more ideas, data, references, and other things that will make your argument more credible.
  *  **Experiment** — you experiment with the idea by dissecting it and seeing all of its parts. You can now piece those parts together in different ways.
  *  **Discoveries** — you make discoveries through experimentation and share them with the world.
  *  **Theories** — over time you will start to make connections between your own discoveries and create your own theories.
  *  **Processes** — you will be testing processes to come up with a replicable method that gets results.

You can start to see how the All-In-One Template inside Notion reflects this.
Writing longer-form content becomes easy when you have re-usable puzzle
pieces.

 **Running An Experiment & Making New Discoveries**

When you run an experiment, you dissect something. You break it down into it’s
parts to gain a deeper understanding of what comprises the whole.

Like when you took apart pens as a kid. You unscrewed the pen, took out the
little plastic thing holding the ink, played with the spring, and started to
understand how it all works together.

Once you do this, you can not only explain what a pen is… but you can explain
how it works, why it works that way, who it works best for, and what other use
cases it can have.

You can also play around with the parts and give them new use cases.

This is what we are doing, but with the ideas we collect from the Intelligent
Imitation process.

That is the first step, having an idea to dissect.

By dissecting the idea, we can dive deeper into its parts, understand the
**depth** behind it, and open up room for better ideas (because your
competition isn’t doing this).

Here some ideas that you can choose to dissect:

 **1) Quotes or Tweets**

Are there quotes that make you think “Damn I wish I wrote that?”

Well, whats stopping you from understanding the depth behind it and creating
your own way of saying it? (Usually, your mind and limiting beliefs behind
taking your message seriously is what’s stopping you. Authority is perceived.
The only reason you take authors seriously is because they wrote a book based
on what they have learned prior.)

You can use your own tweets for this as well. This will help you create and
understand the depth behind your ideas.

 **2) Thoughts & Ideas That Come To Your Mind**

As you are reading, writing, consuming, or just going about life — practice
being observant of the ideas and thoughts that pop into your head.

With this method, anything can be turned into content. Anything. It’s all a
game of packaging up words, ideas, and thoughts into a structure that guides
the reader to potential engagement.

This can be treated as a self-reflection and journaling exercise. Are there
negative thoughts that you want to understand and reframe through your
content? Write them down.

 **3) Previous Ideas Or Talking Points Of Yours**

As you create content in all different forms — writing, speaking, visual (any
other of the 5 senses) — you will start to gain a deeper understanding of the
point you are trying to get across.

This will spark new mental pathways to go down. This is how you truly become
an expert in any given topic. You follow the endless branches that one idea
can take you down.

If you want to get philosophical, this is how you become more conscious. You
realize that everything connects infinitely.

In essence, you are creating a web of ideas that you can connect and combine
(like digital legos) for your writing and creations. This is where things
start to get fun.

Once you have an idea you want to dissect, what does the process entail?

  *  **Write out the idea** — start a new experiment in “The Mind” area of the Notion Command Center.
  *  **Add a reference** — if the idea sparked from something you are consuming, note where you got it from.
  *  **Summarizing it in your own words** — how would you make sense of the idea? How does it make sense to you at your current stage of development? That is how it will make sense to the people you can help.
  *  **Optional** — write out common problems, objections, benefits, metaphors, and personal experiences to set yourself up for great content for that idea. (You will be doing this when you write long-form anyway.)

We are using this process for content creation — but if you want to dive a bit
deeper and have a guided challenge for this, you can download my [7 Days To
Genius Ideas course for free here.](https://7daystogeniusideas.com)

Keep in mind that the setup will be a bit different in that course. I would
encourage you to keep everything you are learning here in mind. Use The
Creator Command Center instead of the Notion template that is provided in that
course.

An All-In-One Solution

This is a journaling, idea generation, note-taking, and content creation
process all in one.

When you have an idea, immediately jot it down in “The Queue” and you can come
back to it later.

**Making New Discoveries**

From all of the information that you wrote out in the experiment template, how
would you summarize it in one sentence?

Can you create your own quote-like impactful way of getting that point across?

How can you help someone understand the complexity of what you wrote in a
simple way?

These are the BIG ideas that much of your content will revolve around.

In essence, you are developing your ability to create profound insights that
have depth behind them.

 **Formulating A Process**

You are in the business of solving your own problems (and the problems of
others). You solve problems by creating and testing a process that gets
results. These processes can be used for consulting, freelancing, or packaged
up into a digital product.

From the problems that your experiment above presents, can you think of steps
that will help people overcome those problems?

This is something you will be improving over time to get better results for
those you are helping. Don’t worry about getting all of the steps 100% perfect
the first time around. Systems are created from consistent positive and
negative feedback.

 **Bonus points:** contemplate a compelling name for your process. If people
use your process, they will talk about it and attribute their success to your
unique system. This spreads your name, gives you more authority, and of course
— get’s results for others.

Processes can be reused throughout much of your content, but under different
lenses and perspectives.

This is one big reason I stress doing things your own way and figuring things
out for yourself. It will take time, but _**coming up with unique processes
that solve problems in your own life is the best way to monetize your
account.**_

Why? Because you understand the real-world relatable problems that others are
facing, you’ve tested various ways of solving it, and you’ve come up with a
unique process that catches attention. People will pay for that. (This entire
course is a culmination of processes I’ve developed.)
