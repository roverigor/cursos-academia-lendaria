Unlimited High Performing Tweets
Tweet writing is mostly about catering to human nature.
You can study algorithms all day (and it is very helpful to do so)… but when you know what makes people engage and share your content, algorithms start to matter less.
When you immerse yourself in proper tweet writing, you start to think in concise and impactful sentences.
Over time, short-form writing will become second nature to you.
Writing good, engaging tweets will transfer over into high engagement on all other platforms.
Generating Unique Ideas
There are a million different ways to generate ideas for tweets (or any length of content).
This is a problem because it get’s overwhelming. Eventually you will find an idea generation that you prefer, gets results, and is sustainable. But you have to try most of them before you get to that point.
The problem for most people:
They are afraid to use a tweet structure because they think they are copying.
What the problem actually is:
Your ideas aren’t original and you feel like you have to copy the entire idea and structure itself.
The structure is for writing out the idea in a high performing way.
If you want potentially viral ideas, find them from:
YouTube
Instagram
Medium
TikTok
Pinterest
Anywhere where you can see how much engagement those posts have.
You can use the
Growing As A Beginner
guide to generate ideas this way.
If you want original perspectives that can be turned into viral ideas:
Read books
Listen to podcasts
Listen to audiobooks
Listen to long YouTube lectures YT premium (so you can listen with your screen off)
Read Blinkist or Shortform summaries
THEN you can plug the ideas you have into a structure that can potentially perform well.
I personally like listening YouTube lectures and audiobooks.
How to capture ideas that come to mind while you are consuming:
We are slowly going to start incorporating a method that will lead into the next module nicely (when we develop our ideas and build a database of concepts).
Consume information using the methods above
Have “The Queue” in the Notion Command Center open on your phone
Be ready to capture and potentially flesh out any ideas you have
When you come back to create content, plug those ideas into a tweet structure
This is how you balance having original ideas that stem from your curiosity AND have them perform well.
Tweet Structures To Emulate
Imitate than innovate.
You start writing good tweets by using structures that are proven to do well.
I see too many people (especially at the beginning) trying to create their own unique tweets. They end up not growing and blaming the algorithm.
My advice:
do what works
(but with your own ideas).
The tweet structures below are in addition to what is already in the Inspiration Lab inside the Notion Command Center.
Commentary On Objections Or Advice
These tweets come from paying attention to your inner dialogue.
When you hear something — how do you respond in your head?
“Extreme” Advice
You don’t have to curse. You just have to transfer the energy by using better words.
What advice worked for you in the past that you want to give to others?
Metaphors
Can you help people understand your perspective by using metaphors?
You can search for good metaphors online and plug your ideas into those as well.
Personal Definitions
How would you define a word or phrase?
You can write these quick by just writing out a word that comes to mind and creating your own definition for it.
“Long walks are…”
“Confidence is…”
“Focus is…”
You can write these for all of your interests and sub-topics within your Domain Of Mastery.
Repetitive Advice & Comparisons
The best way to write this is to just start with a one-sentence piece of advice and brainstorm different variations of that sentence.
(This works for lists as well once you have the word or sentence as the theme of the post)
This Comes After This
Like a story, one thing comes after the next. Write down one word, what it leads to, and what comes next — then refine and edit.
These ones take some brainpower and time to write, but they work.
If This, Then That
This is similar to polarity but starts with “if.”
“If you [this]…” then what?
Harsh Truth With A Hook
Harsh truths in general always work well.
You can add a hook to the top that describes or warns about the advice you are going to give.
Your Personal Way Of Doing Something Common
How do you like doing something that other people do?
This requires you to be observant about how you go about your days.
Polarity & Repetition
Polarity is about comparing two different things. Either opposites or just making slight, nuanced connections.
Unique Advice Or Hacks
These can either be hacks you find online or discover yourself.
My laptop was going to die at a coffee shop one day. It made me focus more and try to get my work done. It worked. So I turned it into a good tweet (that ended up going mega-viral on TikTok)
A list That Describes A Certain Group Of People (That You Identify With & Want To Attract)
Can you describe the traits of yourself or the community you are in?
People will try to lump themselves into having (or not having) those traits. Those that have them will engage and follow.
Interesting Observation
Simple. Notice something interesting and talk about it.
(You can add a hook to the top as well)
Subtweeting Yourself
If you are slacking, what advice would you give yourself?
Think of Twitter like a journal where you give high-engaging advice to yourself (but positioned at others).
2-3 Step Punchy Advice
A shorter version of a list that gives a solution to a problem.
You Can Do This… But You Have To
What is the desired outcome and what is required to get there?
Bonus points if you can use numbers, timeframes, and traits that need to be adopted as a person.
Making People Aware Of A Problem Or Solution
What is causing a problem and what is the solution?
Unique Perspectives On A Common Problem
Take a common problem or perspective and give inspiration or a solution to it.
The Best & Worst
What is the best, greatest, worst, most terrible thing someone can do?
This is about thinking in extremes, which is entertaining.
More Ways To Structure Tweets
Joining The Online Conversation
Did you read a tweet that you don’t agree with? Post your personal opinion or perspective.
Did reading one of your replies spark an idea in you? Did replying to others give you a new perspective on what they are talking about? You can turn your replies or inner commentary into tweets.
Identifying And Solving A Problem In Your Life
What are you struggling with and how do you plan to solve it?
This is another reason why reflection is important.
Horizontal And Vertical Questioning
Branching into new mental pathways is a matter of questioning.
Who, what, when, where, how, why.
You can come up with a tweet topic, like “strategy” and start questioning.
Why would someone need a strategy? To do something more efficiently.
What can they do more efficiently? Create content, code, train, anything.
How can they be efficient with creating content? Now I can create a list of how to speed up their content creation.
Let thoughts trigger thoughts through questioning to come up with better ideas.
Turning 1 Idea Into 1000
The secret to all of this is just exchanging words.
That’s all copywriters do. They have set structures and manipulate different verbs, adjectives, nouns, stories, concepts, metaphors, examples, and more to create unlimited ideas for themself.
One quick tip: you can use
PowerThesaurus
to ideate better adjectives and words in general (to improve the impact and strength of your writing.
Delete for good?
No, keep it
Yes, delete
