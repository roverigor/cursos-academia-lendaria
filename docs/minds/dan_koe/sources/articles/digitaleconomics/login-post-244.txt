The Content Synthesis System
If you want to create irreplaceable content that blows people’s minds — you need a database of high-signal information to pull from.
​​​​​​​
Your reader wants to be entertained and receive tools they can use immediately. That means your book must be sprinkled with anecdotes and useful, practical, hands-on exercises: invented or re-invented by the author.” — Nicholas Boothman
That quote sums things up perfectly (and was in my database I’ve been building… see what I did there ;))
While most creators go “off the dome” and can’t articulate their main points at any given time, you will begin developing key concepts that your brand is known for.
This will come in handy for:
Podcast appearances (you will sound smart)
Long-form content (so you can entertain your reader)
Unique perspectives across all other content (you will become a better storyteller)
First, we need to create a system for researching all of the content we’ve been talking about.
The idea generation methods we used previously are still the “go-to” for validating ideas that will perform well online — because you need to grow.
This content synthesis and research system will give you unique ways of fleshing out those validated ideas.
That way you can be sure your content will perform well, but the way you deliver the message will blow every other creator out of the water.
The Pieces Of Your Content Synthesis System
All of this is up for you to test and find the consumption method that works best for you.
I have tried multiple different ways, but what is
currently
working well for me is:
Go on a 30-60 minute walk around noon
Throw on a YouTube video or audiobook I want to listen to
Note high-signal insights and ideas “The Queue”
Write out summaries and how I make sense of things while walking
Organize it into its respective location in the Command Center (develop the idea further, use it in a newsletter, or turn it into a tweet)
This is vastly different from before and will continue to change over time based on how I enjoy consuming at the time (and what I have time for).
The points listed above are a simple, streamlined, and free way of doing this.
I want to give you all of the tools so you can experiment for yourself — just keep in mind that many of these are paid tools (they are NOT necessary).
1) Readwise
Readwise allows you to transfer highlights from Medium, Shortform, Kindle, and other content software and store them in Notion. From Notion, you can access these highlights and move them around your Command Center however you please — or just leave them there to access at another time.
Readwise also allows you to save tweets, threads, and other articles to Notion.
This makes things more convenient, but if you don’t want to pay for it you can always just note things down in The Queue manually.
Out of this entire list, Readwise is the most important to me. I use it for saving specific quotes and highlights from Medium and Kindle that I can refer to later.

2) Pocket
Pocket is another option for saving most things you find on the internet. I have not used this much as I never really plan to go back and read what I bookmark, but it is an option.

3) Airr
Airr is a podcast listening software that allows you to save clips from podcasts.
Again, convenient, but you can always manually note your findings in The Queue and organize it accordingly.

4) Shortform
These are book summary apps that allow you to get the big ideas from top books (and some nuance). I like using these apps while I am reading or listening to a book. Doing both helps me remember big ideas but also have a lot of nuance. The nuance is usually what gives me the perspectives I need to piece together compelling stories.

Shortform
here (they were kind enough to give a yearly discount for those that use my link!).
5) Medium and Blogs
We’ve discussed this before, but articles are a great way to generate validated ideas and use as inspiration to structure your writing.
These usually give some unique perspectives you can pull from.
If you have a favorite blog, newsletter, or Substack — consider adding that to your content research routine.
Check out
Medium
here.
6) Audible and YouTube premium
These are the two I am currently using the most.
Why? Longer form content is:
Something that most of the world doesn’t consume seriously
It has the most anecdotes, interesting facts, nuances, perspectives, etc that I can use
I will listen to these on my walks, listen intently (like a walking meditation), and note ideas with potential use.
Check out
Audible
and
YouTube Premium
here.
7) Physical books and Kindle
I would personally recommend having a rotation of 5-10 books that impact you on a deep level.
There are books out there that you resonate with deeply. If you haven’t read them a second or third time — you are missing out on crucial information that you missed last time.
The combination of big ideas from these books is what has formed the foundation for my own book. They are pillars in my life and help me make sense of the world. Why would I not understand every facet of those big ideas and form my own philosophy around them?
My favorite combination:
Read a
Shortform
summary to see if I am interested in reading more
Purchase and listen to an audiobook on Audible (and note insights straight into The Queue)
Purchase the book on Kindle to read at night and export important highlights with Readwise into Notion (then I can develop those ideas or use them in newsletters or articles).
8) Your Favorite Ideas
There will be content you come across that starts to form the foundation of your worldview. These are usually the most impactful book chapters, videos, podcasts, and other content pieces that you feel compelled to build on top of.
These are the content pieces that make everything “click” for you. They make everything make sense. That is your job in this space, to make the most sense to the group of people that you make sense to.
The Point With All Of This
The main goal with this system is to have a place to store any and all information you come across throughout your day. No matter where you are getting the information from.
To do this well, you have to search for the congruent voices that make sense to you. This will make you look forward to your research sessions and allow you to be consistent with it.
By having a plethora of tools at our disposal, we can test methods for capturing high signal information no matter where we are getting it from. Podcasts, blogs, books, tweets, etc.
This adds another layer of intention behind everything you do. You will start to gain a deeper appreciation for your work. Every aspect of life starts to gain practical application in a way that can impact and raise the collective well-being.
Nuances And Words Of Advice:
There have been a few nuances I’ve learned from using this system over time.
1) The Queue can add up fast.
If you are like me, you’ll want to put anything and everything inside The Queue. Do this enough times and you will get extremely overwhelmed. You won’t want to develop those ideas (in the next section).
In this case, the best thing you can do is clear out all of the information that you are “saving for later” and don’t have an immediate use for.
If those ideas were important, you’ll come across them again when you have a use case for them.
2) Don’t consume more than you have to.
This is a balance between creativity and productivity.
When you are building out a new project, you may have all of the information you need for the next 2-4 weeks. If you already know what you need to create, content consumption becomes less necessary.
Exhaust the majority of your creative resources before refueling for the next round.
3) This is all up to personal preference.
If you are a beginner, this process may hurt your content creation instead of help it. At the end of the day, this is what works for me — it may not work for your specific interests and goals pertaining to content creation.
As with life, your job is to experiment and iterate on a sustainable idea generation system — preferably one that becomes more complex with time (so others have a hard time keeping up).
This Shouldn't Be A Burden
If all of the information you are storing is overwhelming (instead of inspiring) you will need to iterate on your process.
A good practice is only noting down the things that have immediate use cases OR fit somewhere within your vision.
