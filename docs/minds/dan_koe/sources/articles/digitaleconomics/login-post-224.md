#  Optimizing Your Profile  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Remove from my
favorites")

Everything we are talking about is necessary for your _long-term_ success as a
personal brand.

The problem: little of what we wrote down can be displayed on your profile.

However, everything we have wrote down can be used in content, free products,
paid products, and everywhere else that a potential follower will see.

With that, we need to be careful when crafting our profile — we need to
formulate a profile from the strongest points of what you have filled out so
far.

One metric to keep in mind:

 **Does your profile _look_ like it should have 100,000+ followers?**

No?

Educate and iterate.

 **Why Twitter?**

Twitter will be the foundation of all other platform growth and content idea
generation.

  * Twitter has the most powerful share feature of all platforms. It takes one click to expose your content to an entire new audience of people.
  * You can post as many tweets as you'd like to practice and test ideas. If you posted 10 posts to Instagram or LinkedIn, you wouldn't get anywhere.
  * You don't have to show your face, have design skills, or a sexy body. All you need is a brain and the ability to write.
  * You can get feedback on potential article headlines, newsletter topic ideas, and what content ideas perform the best for you (once you know what does well, you can double down on that and use it to grow on other platforms
  * You can post links in tweets, replies, and at the end of threads. It is one of the best platforms for making sales and sending people to deeper content or other platforms. You can practice and test promotional angles this way

The future of Twitter is bright and is a great starting ground for beginners.

Even if you aren't a beginner, it is a no-brainer and zero-time-added way of
testing your content ideas for other platforms. Use Twitter to develop your
ideas, then you can turn that into posts for all other platforms.

Think about it — why does everyone post screenshots of tweets to other
platforms? Because they go viral all the time.

ALL of my content revolves around my Twitter. Even when it isn't my largest
platform.

This entire content ecosystem will make sense in coming sections.

If you are already creating Instagram posts, reels, TikToks, or other pieces
of content — why not write it out first and schedule it to post on Twitter?
Then you can just read the tweet to the camera.

Twitter Is The Foundation

Twitter is a writing and idea platform. The foundation of all good content is
writing and idea generation.

By building your content strategy around Twitter, you set yourself up for
massive leverage on all platforms — while tapping into an underrated and wide-
open platform for new creators that can win the idea game (Twitter)

**Creating An Attention Grabbing Profile Photo**

Your profile is dependent on the vibe you are trying to give off.

I have seen few people pull this off — but you can still grow if your profile
picture is a random picture of selfie.

I know a lot of young business accounts that have blurry profile pictures of
them at the club — because that's the vibe and lifestyle they are trying to
display. Their content matches that.

BUT, for most people, you will want to create a professional profile photo or
a logo that displays the tone you plan to speak in.

A few things to consider:

 **1) How is the lighting?**

Can you see your face clearly?

Are you under harsh lighting that makes you look bad?

 **2) Where are you looking?**

Are you looking away from the camera? (For a more mysterious or insightful
look)

Are you looking at the camera? (For a more direct and confident look)

Are you looking at your content? (Directing people's attention to your
content)

 **3) Do you have good contrast?**

Does your picture stand out on the timeline?

I am not talking about only color here. I am talking about contrast between
creator and consumer images — will people think of you as a followable person?
Or will they see you as someone who is just a bit more active on socials?

 **4) Are you unattractive?**

Don't take this personally, but you know if you are unattractive or not.

It is human nature to trust attractive people more.

If you do not have the best looks, consider being anonymous and paying for a
professional icon or logo to be created on Fiverr or Upwork.

OR — have someone create a vector or animated version of a good picture of
yourself.

We will go over examples of these at the bottom of this section.

If you do go the anonymous route, you have to be extra sure that you are
hitting all 3 pillars of social leverage.

There is an art to running an anonymous account that still builds trust and
brings in sales.

The Only Thing They See

When you are engaging with other people or having your content shared — people
only see your profile picture, your name, and the content along with it.

Does your profile picture _scream_ that you are a creator that provides value?

**Crafting A Bio Based On Where You're At In Your Journey**

When you are an absolute beginner you won't have much authority to bank on.
You can take a few directions in this case:

 **Learn in public** — form your bio based around what you are learning, what
you talk about, and why people should care.

 **Build in public** — form your bio based around a project you are building,
the vision you are building out, and the lessons that come from that.

You don't have to have a shred of experience to start posting online.

You can curate and share content that you've learned. An example from Sahil:

> The top 1% of new ideas I've encountered:
>
> — Sahil Bloom (@SahilBloom) [May 28,
> 2022](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1530548115891175424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Sahil writes down what he learns and teaches what he learned. It can be that
simple.

If you are experienced and have relevant expertise (expertise that relates to
your Domain Of Mastery) you can:

 **1) Flex your credentials or accomplishments**

Have you helped a certain amount of people?

Have you worked somewhere reputable that people will recognize (I.E. Google?)

What do you have that others want? That's why people follow you — because they
want to do what you've done. They want a higher status in the world. They want
to know what you know.

 **2) Show people what project you are building.**

Are you building something that will help your audience?

Are you working on a project — personal or professional — that others can
benefit hearing the lessons from and learning about?

 **3) Be straightforward with what you talk about and why it matters.**

What _exactly_ do you help people learn and why should they care? What problem
are you solving or benefit are you promising? What's the transformation?

The main thing is accurately describing or implying what the reader will
learn, achieve, or receive with social proof to back that.

 **One thing to keep in mind:**

This goes against much of the advice in the freelancing or consulting space.

They ALWAYS tell you to have the " _I help X do Y without Z_ " bio.

Boring. Everyone does that. And you know what happens if everyone does it...

This will only make you a commodity and limit the amount of people you can
help.

It will also make you feel like you can't talk about your other interests.

Save the selling for somewhere else. Not in your bio.

Emphasize education, bringing people into your deeper content (your
newsletter), and selling from there.

__

Don't Overthink This

How can you creatively put across what you are helping other people achieve or
learn? Why should they care?

**Other Profile Touchpoints To Consider**

There are a few other aspects of social media profiles on any platform that
should be taken into account.

 **1) Your header image.**

Does it match your brand colors?

Are you promoting a product? If not, does the image you are using represent
your vision (does it give off the feeling of what people will experience when
they reach your vision)?

 **2) Your profile link.**

Many people are afraid of putting a link in their profile because it may seem
"salesy" or feel like you are selling something.

Putting a link in your bio shows that you are building something. It gives
people somewhere to go to deepen their trust with you.

If you don't have a link in your bio, you are missing out on building a loyal
following.

People follow others because they give out valuable information.

When in doubt, put a link to your newsletter there.

 **3) Your pinned posts.**

This is available on a few platforms like Twitter and TikTok.

What should you put here?

  * Your highest engagement post to flex social proof (people trust things with high engagement).
  * A thread or post about your hero's journey (your story, the struggles you went through, and what you talk about).
  * A thread or post that has actionable beginner-level advice based on your expertise to raise their level of awareness.

All of those should plug your newsletter so you can funnel readers into there.

 **4) What is showing on your profile timeline.**

You don't want people to go to your profile and see a bunch of retweeted or
shared content. You want to give them a taste about what kind of content you
post.

This stresses the importance of un-retweeting or un-sharing posts every day.

You can also retweet your best tweets after you share someone's posts to keep
yours at the top.

Levels Of Awareness

Remember that you are speaking to a low level of awareness when they come
across your profile. They are nowhere near ready to buy from you or even trust
you.

Focus on what they will learn in basic terms.

**Examples Of Great Profiles**

Profile optimization is best illustrated with examples of some great accounts.

This stresses the importance of emulation, imitation, and "stealing like an
artist."

You will get more ideas out of this video than the entirety of what you just
read.
