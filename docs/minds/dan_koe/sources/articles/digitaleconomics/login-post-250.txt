The Principles Of Social Growth
As with many things in life...
if you aren't growing, you're dying.
(Take that with a grain of salt if you are just starting out. Growth is small and inconsistent until you post that one piece of content that changes everything, mentally, for you).
I want to reiterate where your priorities should be.
If you haven’t grown a substantial amount on one platform, trying to grow on another platform will be just as difficult.
Until you are ready to branch out – I would go through this module for the sole purpose of making connections. Try to understand the overall system and mechanics of social media as a whole. There are a lot of crossovers that may open your eyes and help you grow faster on Twitter.
There is a reason I am able to grow so rapidly on other social platforms:
I spent 1 year building my Twitter account and wrote 10K+ tweets
I had a database of tweets that I know get engagement and bring in followers
I practiced capturing, holding, and converting attention until it was second nature (this is 10x easier to practice with short-form writing than something like video, graphics, or other visuals).
I can repost all of my old tweets endlessly and outperform most accounts because they didn’t practice crafting an impactful message (capturing attention and delivering value)
My follower count acts as leverage. I can reach out to big Instagram accounts and offer to trade shares. They share me on Insta (or any other platform), I share them on Twitter. Social Leverage.
I built and grew with a network of other creators. We have masterminded and taken over other platforms in a strategic fashion.
It all starts with everything we discussed in modules 1 and 2 of this course.
Focus On Leverage, Not Money
Remember the 3 Pillars Of Social Leverage?
This is the result of good, diverse, and impactful content.
I want you to understand the importance of this through a story.
I first met Justin Welsh (the LinkedIn king) by connecting with him in the DMs (using the Non-Needy Networking framework).
I “led with value” by offering to have him on my podcast. I didn’t have to get him on a podcast, I could have just gotten on a call with him and it still would have worked out the same way.
Over the past few months he’s been helping me with LinkedIn and I’ve been helping him with Twitter and Instagram.
On Twitter, I mostly just comment on his posts. On Instagram, I sent him Loom videos on the basics of the platform and my current system for content repurposing (what you are learning in this course).
I grow fast on LinkedIn through his help, he grows more on Twitter and Instagram.
Win-win.
This week I asked him why he is working with me (and a few others) to do this with.
His response:
“You’re a good creator. You write good content, don’t get caught up in drama, care about your work, and deliver value on a consistent basis. I like working with people I can trust.”
Those aren’t his exact words, but they are pretty close.
In short, focusing on the money is only going to hurt potential opportunities.
Focus on writing great tweets, writing threads / newsletters, and networking for the sake of growth while giving away as much value as you can.
If you want to help other creators with things you’ve learned in this course, feel free. Just be sure to
make it your own
through The Epistemic Method, experience, and writing about it first.
Another story about the first time I spent $3500 on coaching:
Perception is powerful.
When I was around 5,000 followers, an account that I loved sent me a DM.
“Hey Dan, I want to talk to you, when can we get on a call?”
No joke. That’s it.
He had around 40K followers at the time.
I loved his content to the point that him sending me a DM sent me into fight or flight.
“No way, this guy wants to talk to me? That’s insane. I HAVE to get on this call.”
That was my thought process.
I was scared sh*tless because he was an authority in the space, but I knew it would open up opportunities for me.
We scheduled a call, talked for a bit, and he asked if I wanted to hear about his coaching.
I wasn’t even paying attention. I said yes, he explained the coaching and then told me the price.
Again… I wasn’t even paying attention. I was awestruck that I was on a call with a guy that I had looked up to for so long.
I said yes without hesitation, paid the invoice, and that was that.
By the way, this was social media coaching (which anyone can sell if they build an audience successfully).
He rarely talks about social media (because it doesn’t get too much engagement), he talks about self-improvement. But I knew he had social media, writing, design, business, and mindset expertise just because of the brand he’s built using those skills.
THIS is the power of consistently putting out content.
NO freelancer or coach without an audience can even fathom this reality.
You eliminate a lot of the traditional sales process by just consistently putting out good content for a year.
One more short story to hammer this point home:
I reached out to a HUGE account on Twitter to ask for help growing my account.
He said,
“I offer a 30-minute call and 10 retweets for $5000.”
(Because he built LEVERAGE, that’s why he can charge whatever he wants.)
A lot of money, but I accepted and maxed out my credit card.
The retweets didn’t even do that well. Our audiences didn’t have much crossover.
But it didn’t matter, I was in his circle now.
I could reach out to him for almost anything and get a response. Even better if I offered something in return like my Instagram strategy.
His retweets:
Put me in front of his entire 300,000+ audience
Put me in front of HUGE accounts that follow him
Got me on good terms with himself, he followed me (people can see that he followed me when they visit my profile, that helps with authority… a part of social leverage)
It doesn’t matter if they didn’t follow me immediately.
I was put on their radar.
I was made AWARE to them. Like the sales process, people don’t buy right after seeing your product. People may not follow you the first time they see your tweet.
Those retweets acted as him endorsing my content. Also, he wouldn’t have worked with me or retweeted me if my content wasn’t good.
Long game (emphasis on the word “game”). There is MUCH more than you can see.
Those retweets were expensive, but I made that “money” back in much more than just money.
I am not saying that you need to shovel money into social media (although it’s not a bad idea if this is truly the vessel for your life’s work).
I’m saying that leverage trumps all.
Leverage comes from well-written content, building an audience, and networking with people (both free and paid).
There Is More Than What You See
Pay attention to more than just your profile, content, and engagement. This is SOCIAL media. It requires PEOPLE.
How do your interactions with people (that the timeline doesn't see) impact your growth?
Start becoming aware of this.
What To Focus On
In the following sections of this module, we will be going over the fundamentals, strategies, and nuances to every platform that can work off of our content ecosystem.
Here is what you will be focusing on:
1) Leveraging Others’ Audiences For Growth
When you are just starting out, the ONLY way you are going to grow on ANY social media platform is by leveraging others audiences.
You do this by:
Joining communities and cohorts
DMing people you want to grow, network, or work with
Commenting under big accounts with “value add” replies
Practicing your tweet writing by quote tweeting accounts and using their tweet as inspiration
Optional — but should always be mentioned and made less taboo for those that choose to play the social media game — is paying for shares on good content
Growth is a priority.
If you aren’t growing, something needs to change.
Ask your network what they think you could be doing better
Broaden the topics you talk about so they are relevant to more people (example: instead of talking about “online business” talk about “money” as a whole)
Be sure your bio and profile is broad enough to attract a large audience — your emails, lead magnets, and other backend content are how you get them “up to speed” on the specific things you talk about.
Practice and put conscious effort into your writing. If it takes 2 hours to write an attention-grabbing tweet and deliver structured value, that’s okay. You will get better.
Use the methods we discussed in modules 1 and 2 — go back through them and see if you learn something new that you may have missed earlier.
2) Understanding The General Level Of Sophistication Of The Platform
Pay attention to what kind of posts get the most engagement on each platform.
You can gauge this by looking at the comment sections of someone's post.
On TikTok or Instagram you will have a low level of sophistication people that will always try to fight you in the comments if your content is good (ignore and block them).
On Twitter and LinkedIn people have a higher level of awareness and are open to learning new things. LinkedIn of course has a lot of professionals that scroll LinkedIn while they work. There is a lot more money flowing there compared to other platforms (when you are selling on the platform itself as opposed to your newsletters).
Podcasts, longer YouTube videos, newsletters, and blog articles have higher levels of sophistication. People that open your emails don’t have other posts trying to steal their attention. This is where you will build the deepest connection and make the most money.
3) How To Send Traffic With The Platform
This is another reason I recommend Twitter as an incredible starting point. You have creative freedom with your plugs and promotions because you can post links anywhere (threads are the most powerful way to sell your products compared to any other platform).
On a platform like Instagram, you can only have 1 link in your bio and can post links in your stories (and store them in your story highlights). You can’t post links in your posts or comments.
We will be going over the correct strategies for these on each platform in the coming sections.
