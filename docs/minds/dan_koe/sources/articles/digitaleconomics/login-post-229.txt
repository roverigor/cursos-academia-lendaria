Growing As A Beginner
When you are just starting out (on any social media platform) you won't have any eyes on your profile.
This means you need to get creative and understand how you are going to get eyes on your profile without retweets or shares.
It takes time to network and DM a lot of people, but there are other options you can take advantage of.
How To Engage Properly
Most people know about this or have caught onto it — but the main way of getting eyes on your profile without relying on content is through engagement.
That is, engaging with larger accounts in your niche because they already have traffic (eyeballs) going to the replies.
If your profile picture is good and catches attention, people will be more likely to read your replies.
Do not just reword what they said or write something that won't get people to click on your profile.
Instead:
Give your perspective on the topic
Talk about a problem you solved related to that topic and how
Tell a short story that comes to mind when reading that topic
ADD to the tweet and format it like you would your own content
Ask a question that will get them to respond to you
The more replies you get out, the more potential for growth you have.
This is also a great way to generate content ideas.
If you can't think of content ideas, go engage with 5 people's tweets and tell me you don't have ideas anymore.
A Forbidden Growth Strategy For Those Under 1000 Followers
This isn't something that people would advise. Many advise against it.
But, this is something I did at the start and I want to give you tools you can use at YOUR own discretion.
You will also want to ween off of these strategies soon.
I was not going to include this here, but I want to give you multiple different weapons to attack social media with.
It is your responsibility to use these strategies correctly.
If you want to play it safe —
avoid follow for follow completely.
Also, Twitter and Instagram have a limit on the amount of content you can like.
If you plan to use the like strategy — start off with no more than 20 per day. You can test and increase from there, but the higher you go, the more fire you are playing with.
The video has more nuance and the entire 2-fold strategy.
Please do not give me credit for this strategy lol. Use it at your own risk.
Getting Started With Content On The Right Foot
Virality doesn't matter — but it would be silly to not put as much effort as you can into increasing the engagement of any given post.
How can you make even the most boring topic high engaging?
We will be diving into more advanced content creation strategies later on, but I want to give you the strategy that I used for a long time to come up with high-engaging tweets.
The secret to all of this (especially at the beginning):
DO WHAT WORKS.
Again, this is why imitation and emulation is important.
Where do you find content ideas?
Most popular YouTube videos from creators in your niche
Top ranking blog posts found through Google search
The featured articles on Medium based on your interests
Top tweets from creators in your niche using
Twemex
or
TweetHunter
Pinterest, Instagram, TikTok — I have not figured out how to find the best posts, but if they get high engagement you can take them
​​​​​​​I would recommend pulling topics from your Domain Of Mastery to search on YouTube, Google, or Medium.
How do you use these content ideas?
The content you find will be tried and true (especially the YouTube videos, they work wonders for idea generation).
YouTube videos, podcasts, and articles can be turned into threads. You can also turn ideas from those videos into individual tweets.
The main thing you are looking for here is the headline or video title.
Your job is to take that big idea and turn it into content that falls under your brand.
A headline can be turned into:
Short-form content (tweet, insta post, another headline)
An idea for your own expansion on that idea (a thought that triggers a thought)
The content in a video or article can be turned into:
List style tweets / social posts (if the original content is structured / numbered)
Individual tweets from a random "knowledge bomb"
Threads that are already structured for you
This is a given, but do not plagiarize — synthesize and curate.
This is what everyone does. We all just steal from each other to give different perspectives on a specific idea Your customers are determined by your branding + marketing + getting in front of their face with the right offer.
There is only so much you can talk about for a specific topic — so why not talk about the ideas that work?
We all have our own unique biases that will make these unique. This is an art.
Leveraging Larger Audiences With Content Curation
You can get in front of more people by leveraging connections that you make in the DMs and engaging with larger accounts, but there is another strategy.
There are 2 ways to do this:
1) You can write a thread, tag relevant people that talk about that topic, and send it to them saying they inspired the post.
2) You can curate a list of tweets, visuals, or posts that have already done well (by looking at the creators' top tweets). You can then create a thread out of these, tag all of them, and potentially get retweeted by everyone.
This is difficult to explain in text, so I'll let the video take over from here.
Delete for good?
No, keep it
Yes, delete
