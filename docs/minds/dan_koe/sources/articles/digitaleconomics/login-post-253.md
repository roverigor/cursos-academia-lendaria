Podcasting is an incredible way to build a deeper connection with your
audience.

MOST of my initial ($8,000) coaching clients either came from the podcast
itself, or told me that they listened to the podcast.

Like a newsletter, you can dive deeper into topics and give necessary nuance
that can’t happen on traffic-generating platforms that favor the opposite.

Your podcast doesn’t need to be in the top 100 charts if you don’t want it to
be.

If you don’t see yourself becoming a full-time podcaster, then I wouldn’t
recommend stressing out over this or consistent guest episodes (or guest
episodes at all!)

Treat it as an audience nurturing platform over a brand growth mechanism.

See it as another layer to your newsletter for people that want to go even
deeper.

This is where your most loyal fans will go — even if you only get a few
listeners.

This isn’t exact by any means, but I would argue that 100 podcast listeners
are worth 5,000 Twitter or Instagram followers. That is what I’ve noticed.

 **Recommended Podcast Equipment & Resources**

There are many podcast distribution platforms, but the only one I have
experience with is [Anchor.fm.](https://anchor.fm)

I’ve enjoyed it so far, haven’t had any major problems, and would recommend it
to everyone.

 **Microphones**

The most affordable and quality microphone is the [Yeti
Blue](https://www.amazon.com/Microphone-Recording-Streaming-Podcasting-
Adjustable/dp/B00N1YPXW2). I would recommend that if you are just starting out
and don’t want to spend a lot of money.

The industry standard (that most big podcasters use) is the [Shure
SM7B](https://www.amazon.com/Shure-SM7B-Cardioid-Dynamic-
Microphone/dp/B0002E4Z8M). You will have to research how to best use this mic
with your computer and set up — it is more than just a USB plugin (I think).

I accidentally bought the Shure MV7 thinking it was the SM7B. It was a good
purchase, but I wish I spent a bit more for the better version.

 **Audio Editing Software**

The best audio editing software out there is
[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/). That’s all you need. There are a
plethora of tutorials online on how to use it, how to make your voice sound
professional, and how to edit your audio further.

 **Guest Interview Software**

I have tried ZenCastr, SquadCast, and a few others.
[Riverside.fm](https://riverside.fm/) has come out on top every time. It is
worth the investment if you plan on having guests on your podcasts
consistently.

Riverside also allows you to mark potential clips WHILE recording the podcast.
You can create these clips from the editor inside the software itself to
upload to other platforms.

If you don’t have the money to spend, Zoom works just fine for recording guest
podcasts.

 **How To Repurpose Your Content For A Podcast**

The podcast has gone through many iterations in the 100 or so episodes I’ve
recorded.

Lesson: don’t be afraid to change things up if you don’t like what you are
doing, aim for consistency.

Originally, I had 3 podcast episodes a week.

  * 1 guest podcast with people from Twitter (this helped me connect with A LOT of people)
  * 1 podcast with Joey to talk about self-improvement and business topics
  * 1 solo podcast where I give life updates

I did not study or buy courses on podcasting. I listened to podcasts,
struggled to emulate them, and got better (as with most things I’ve done).

Side note: the only reason I buy courses or coaching anymore is to see how
they structure everything and how they teach. That has helped me more than
being told exactly what to do (because then it is hard to teach others my own
unique methods… Experience Model)

Eventually, I got tired of guest podcasts. They stopped aligning with my
vision and I felt like I was giving away too much misinformation when I
brought health people on.

At that point, I changed the podcast to 1x a week and started using my
newsletter as a soft script. It was different from my YouTube videos because I
was going on more tangents and letting it drag on a bit longer.

Recently, I’ve decided to only talk about 1 big idea from the newsletter, my
Twitter content, or just something that I want to talk about. I keep it to 10
minutes long and it has been doing very well.

The 10-minute big ideas are a sustainable way to have an active podcast,
nurture your audience, and make more sales.

 **How To Send Traffic With A Podcast**

Simple.

You should write out a promotional script for the beginning, middle, and end
of your podcast that you can read off. This will of course be dependent on the
length of your podcast.

  * Under 15 minutes — have a promotion at the end only.
  * Between 15 and 45 minutes — have a promotion at the beginning and end.
  * Over 45 minutes — have a promotion at the beginning, middle, and end.

Use the AIDA or PAS copywriting framework to do this.

You can have an exclusive discount for podcast listeners on specific offers.
This usually works best for a digital product, physical product, or
membership. I wouldn’t recommend discounting a consulting or freelance
service.

Similar to your YouTube description, you will want to link all of your
relevant resources, products, and services in the show notes so you can direct
people there.

 **How To Leverage Others' Audiences With A Podcast**

This one should be obvious — but having guests on your podcast is how you grow
your podcast audience (if you don’t already have an audience to send to your
podcast, or if you want to become known FOR your podcast… it’s all goal
dependent).

When you bring a guest on the podcast, you achieve a few things:

  * You build a connection with that person and “add” them to your network. They will respond to you and help you grow if they can.
  * If you have a solid promotional strategy (like making clips or compelling posts) you can leverage their audience on other social platforms like Instagram.
  * You can use your podcast as a “lead with value” strategies in the DMs to bring people more exposure to their brand (so they become a part of your network).

People you want to connect with are much more likely to get on a podcast with
you than on a call, especially if they are “out of your league.”

People understand that podcasts have a HUGE lifetime value. They can be found
and referenced at any time, like a blog post. They don’t disappear after a day
like a Tweet or Instagram post. People will talk about the podcast (if it’s
good) and it will continue to grow your brand if other people are searching
for your podcast guest's name.
