#  Non-Needy Networking  [ __](javascript:void\(0\); "Remove from my
favorites")

Most people suck at DMs.

Seriously. It's a problem.

Never, and I repeat never ever ever expect a response if all you send is:

  * Hi or hey
  * How are you
  * Can you follow me back
  * A straight sales pitch with no prior connection
  * A long block of text that takes too much time to read (especially if the sentences aren't spaced out)

You have to approach DMs tactically. Especially if you are reaching out to a
big account that gets 10+ DMs an hour and probably doesn't check them (they
usually skim over them to see if there is anything important).

Again, put yourself in the other person's shoes and think for a second. How
can you stand out from the sea of crappy DMs that don't provide a shred of
value before asking for something in return?

 **7 Steps To Non-Needy Networking**

Knowing how to communicate and DM another person that you want to connect with
will open up opportunities to paid work, social leverage, and meeting high-
level people. You can use this strategy to:

  * Get a 50,000+ follower account to retweet your thread that will result in massive growth (the same goes for any other social platform sharing your post)
  * Have connections that will share new growth strategies with you (Dickie Bush just sent me a LinkedIn tip the other day out of nowhere, I feel compelled to return the favor now)
  * Join or create mastermind groups and begin forming your tribe (that you will grow with for much of your social media journey)
  * To put your name in more peoples mouths. The more people that know about you, the more work and potential connections will be sent your way. **Get your name in front of as many eyes as possible.**

Here are the 7 steps of Non-Needy Networking:

 **1) Find somebody that you WANT to DM**

This is not exclusive to making connections. It is crucial for paid work as
well.

The common theme between service businesses is that their life is a living
hell if they do not resonate with the client they are working with.

Reach out to people that:

  * You are inspired by
  * You would want to work with
  * You would want to strategize with
  * You see potential for mutual benefit

When you are just starting out, you will have to work your way up the ladder.
Start by DMing people that are within your follower range (or your cohort
classmates!)

Once you have an audience and leverage, you can really reach out to anybody
and get a warm response.

 _Where can you find people to DM?_

  * The "following" list of accounts that you like
  * In the reply area of one of your mentors (if people are replying, it is implied that they are trying to grow and network)

Those are the main two areas to find people without using any fancy
prospecting tools.

 **2) Send them an inspired compliment**

Find a piece of their content, work, or current projects that you are truly
inspired by. Send it to them and tell them how it resonated with you.

This requires you to actually like their work

People love praise — and per the principle of reciprocity — will feel
obligated to repay this soft favor.

An example for a tweet on managing emotions:

> What's up Dan, this tweet hit me hard. I've been going through it the past
> couple of days and this instantly gave me some relief. Thank you. [add the
> link to the post]

  

Simple as that.

 **3) Show interest in them**

If they don't respond, you can try reaching out again in the same manner.

Showing interest is communication 101 — showing interest makes you
interesting.

Ask them about:

  * Their goals
  * What they are building
  * What they do for work

This gives you the opportunity to give value (even if YOU don't have value to
give right now).

Let's assume they respond with the generic "thank you so much."

Now, you can either find what they are working on from their profile or just
ask them.

 **If you find what they are working on:**

> What are your next plans with Modern Mastery? It's been crazy seeing it
> grow, I'm curious what you've got in store.

  

 **If you can't find what they are working on:**

> Do you have anything that you're building right now? With that kind of
> content you must have something bigger in the works.

  

 **4) Lead with value**

This is the part that trips most people up.

Your first options are to:

  * See where you can help 
  * Send actionable tips
  * Send resources, systems, or videos you've created or remember off the top of your head

 _Don't go straight for a transaction when you haven't given anything first._

If you have to ask more questions in order to send better actionable tips or
resources, do it.

By resources I mean YouTube videos, articles, or anything that may be able to
help them — or would pique their interest.

If you have no value to give you can:

  * Send a resource that can help them with their goals
  * Connect them with someone else in your network
  * Just continue having a good conversation and showing interest

Show that you are interested in helping them.

 **5) Get on a call to make a deeper connection**

This part is optional but recommended. You can skip straight to step 7 after a
few days, but I would practice all of these steps at some point.

Making that "face-to-face" interaction is priceless. Nobody can see you, your
personality, or your mannerisms via text.

When I was starting out, I was getting on zoom calls left and right with
people that I wanted to get to know better. It's more normal than you think —
and people are usually open to it when it is clear that you are just there to
get to know them.

You can also take the conversation to somewhere like Telegram and send voice
messages to make yourself seem more human. Most social accounts use Telegram
and Whatsapp groups to communicate and strategize.

 **6) Follow up with value**

Remember their goals and keep an eye out for any content, resources, or people
you can send their way. When you find something or someone, send it to them.

> I remember you telling me about your plans for [their project or goal]. I
> found this today and thought you'd find it helpful.

  

"This" can be a YouTube video, article, lead magnet you found, or a person you
connected with that may be able to help them.

 **7) Follow up with an ask**

By this point you've built a pretty damn solid connection. You've given value
to the point where they are ready to return the favor. From here you can:

Ask them to join a mastermind group

Send them one of your posts that you put a lot of time into

Ask any specific questions you have for them without paying for consulting

If your plan is to leverage their audience for growth, be sure to write a post
that they would want to share. Then, you can send it to them and mentioned
that they inspired that post.

> Yo, just wrote this up and thought you'd enjoy it. It was inspired by our
> previous conversation.

  

Do not ask them to retweet it. Let them engage with it however they see fit.

Even if you don't get a retweet or share, any engagement will help more people
see it — helping you grow.

You should be reaching out to people almost every day. If you are immersing
yourself in the environment of your interests, you should see inspirational
people that you want to reach out to on a daily basis.

 **If you want to increase the chances of larger accounts responding to your
DMs — follow them and engage with their content for a few days before reaching
out so they are familiar with your face and profile picture.**

One More Reminder

DMs. Are. Important.

You may not see the value in it now — but I promise you will grow 10x faster
than the next person if you prioritize connections (especially as a beginner).

They don't say "your network is your net worth" for nothing.

**Forming A Mastermind**

Social media is tribal.

We tend to associate one person with another group of people whether we
realize it or not.

You can build your own tribe of people by connecting with them first using
Non-Needy Networking and then asking if they want to join a mastermind group
to help each other grow.

For a mastermind group, you will mainly be reaching out to people that have a
similar follower account as you. The lower followers you have, the more picky
people will be about joining a group with you.

Whether you are for or against the idea of engagement groups - they are an
extremely good way of:

  * Leveraging others' network of followers to get eyes on your content and profile
  * Making lifelong connections (I am still friends with those in my first mastermind group)
  * Strategizing with those at a similar level as you, sharing new tactics you are learning
  * Staying active on the timeline and building your tribe (people will start to associate you with those people, and it will build a stronger connection with your audience)

The general problem with mastermind groups is that they aren't structured.
People send posts at every second of the day... some don't send, and the group
ends up dying out.

This is the strategy that I used from 5K to 50K ish followers. It's simple and
doesn't require you to share a ton of posts and destroy your feed.

At the end of the day, how you use these mastermind groups are up to you. You
can use them to:

  * Create a group where you comment on everyone's posts to boost engagement
  * Create a group where you retweet each other (or share depending on the platform) to get more eyes on each others accounts
  * Create a group where you share strategies that are working for you

None of this is mandatory if you are already engaging with people, networking
in the DMs, and getting eyes on your content and profile.

Below I've embedded a video explaining exactly how to structure the group
[using this excel
sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14jS8OPJSLYFPWFHYRm7VCMxmNo9M2Is2-nCeSzpqsMM/edit?usp=sharing)
(click "File > Make a copy" and then you can edit).

Now if you don't want to form this kind of mastermind group, **you can always
reach out to connections you've built individually.**

If you create a post that you want shared, you can always send it to one of
your close connections, ask them to share it or engage with it, and tell them
to send you something to share in return to share or engage with.
