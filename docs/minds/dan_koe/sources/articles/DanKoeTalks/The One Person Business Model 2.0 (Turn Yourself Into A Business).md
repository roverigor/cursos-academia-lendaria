a new Society has emerged a virtual one
and not the one that we originally
thought was going to come into existence
years down the road and would be
facilitated by something like Apple's
new VR headset that's not how Evolution
Works Evolution comes from solving the
problems that cause our suffering it is
a slow burn until it finally explodes
the emergence of this new virtual
society that I'm talking about came into
being as fast as a star exploding we
called it social media when it happened
but there were burning problems in human
life that programmers Visionaries and
businessmen spent years solving up until
this point communication was local
information was local business was local
opportunities were local centuries of
geographic restriction changed in the
blink of an eye the internet allowed for
the emergence of social media and social
media allowed for the emergence of the
Creator economy and that is something so
new that not many people have been able
to wrap their heads around the
significance of what the equator economy
actually is because the Creator economy
allowed for the advancement of
decentralization the Industrial
Revolution caused an unsustainable
development of dominance hierarchies
more people and less power at the top
with less power and more people at the
bottom and the age of information began
to reverse this effect with the
development of Creator actualization
hierarchies so the distinction there is
that there are two different kind of
hierarchies that are Dominator or
dominance hierarchies this is what gives
them the bad rap which is like an ape at
the top of the food chain that has his
picking of female apes and food and
whatever they want and it's the same
thing with corporate jobs where you can
only rise so far up the ladder because
there's only so few people let up to the
top of the ladder but an actualization
hierarchy continues to evolve evolve
evolve and people move up along with it
as the crater economy and the people in
it pass down their lessons via courses
and content and everything of that
nature as they evolve and change what
they do because creators pivot all the
time they don't stick to one static
Niche like many people tell you to it
changes with your interests and skill
set and experience changing once you hit
a certain level in business there comes
a point where you have to push further
and you're going to be passing down
lessons from that lens and so the actual
the Creator actualization hierarchies of
passing down your teachings teaching
what you know it's not a pyramid scheme
like many people think it is or will
immediately label it as of like oh
you're just selling a course on this
that and that and oh it's a period
pyramid scheme because they don't
understand they haven't done it they
haven't experienced it they're viewing
one little piece of it taking it out
from the entire story of what it is or
the entire picture of what it is like
taking a pixel from an image and
expecting it to make sense as a pixel
and then they're just labeling it so
they don't have to actually do it when
it is going to be a necessary part of
life and so these actualization
hierarchies are based on skill they're
based on skill and experience and that
is what allows you to rise up it is
completely within your control to
maneuver your way to however far you
want to go up so what is this Creator
society that I'm talking about because
there's crater society and then economy
within it so I'll start this out with a
tweet that I believe sums up most of
what we're going to talk about here
knowledge not found in schools is the
source of money not found in employment
with the development of the internet
information has spread beyond measure
it's just uncontrollable it's a wildfire
and so this led to the development of a
more advanced Global and accessible
Society on the internet societies
consist of Institutions communities with
shared beliefs and cultural ideas the
most notable aspects are the school
system Workforce social and business
tribes and religious establishments
social media has expanded and collapsed
the lines between these if you are a
follower of like non-duality then you
understand that this is a natural part
of universal Evolution where things
divide and they reunite and so we're
dividing away from corporate dominance
into individual power and there's so
many shared perspectives that people
aren't able to take one ideology fit it
into something like a religious
institution in a specific culture in a
specific location lock people into that
Paradigm indoctrinate and brainwash them
that's not possible with the development
of social media it's possible but it's
much less likely just because everyone
can see it happening and they can stop
it from happening because they know it's
a problem and so on the topic of the
school system the public Traditional
School System has many problems
convergent thinking compartmentalized
learning Conformity over authenticity
memorization over process failure as
something to avoid authorities as
unquestionable long work over efficiency
and True Value intelligence defined as
book smarts decade-old curriculums that
only worry about training you into a
replaceable job and so of course there's
benefits but the deficits outweigh that
entirely there is no arguing that that's
because this is evolution we've gotten
to this point where a new school system
is emerging because it is demanded it
has to happen for us to move forward so
the new school system in the Creator
Society AKA passionate creators that go
and research the topics that they love
and distribute the lessons from their
own lens to the people that resonate
with that lens it allows individuals to
pursue their curiosity find teachers or
creators that they learn best from treat
learning as a part of life rather than
an annoying obligation learn modern
skills that allow you to adapt fast to
the fast changing environment find
specific knowledge that contribute to
their pursuit of self-generated rather
than assigned goals and prioritize
entrepreneurship as it is the only
logical end goal for those that want
more out of life the new school system
is internet content and courses none of
this is labeled it is just a part of
virtual life the religious
establishments narrowed the minds of its
followers and fought any perspective
that contradicted their own now
spiritual awareness and education are
accessible in most Creator Brands you
can open your mind study different
perspectives lives and self-experiment
until you cultivate a philosophy that
suits you this is not only for spiritual
growth but mental financial and health
related growth so that's the society the
school system religious system or
spiritual system and government and we
didn't touch on that but government is
pretty much people self-regulating
themselves and kind of tribes going to
war against each other this is what you
see when people make like reaction
videos to other people to kind of police
what they're doing and keep the industry
in check so what is the creator economy
because the exchange of goods has been a
natural part of existence since the
Inception of human interaction that's
how you like the exchange of goods Goods
can be a product service idea or
whatever you're selling or communicating
to another person and so money or
currency is a neutral form of value
individuals spend it on what they
perceive as valuable because other Goods
didn't match that it's like I could if
someone didn't see my little Clay Pot as
valuable then I didn't have a currency
to get what I wanted and so something
like money had to be created to kind of
level the playing field and allow people
to exchange what they deem valuable for
what they want and so with that you can
start to understand the importance of
marketing and sales because marketing
and sales is just illustrating the value
of your product and putting a price tag
on something that matches that for a
specific person at a specific level of
awareness with specific goals with a
specific level of mind with specific
problems in their life because that's
what composes someone's identity right
and this is why you need a target
audience or a Target Persona I recommend
targeting yourself because you
understand your identity the best and
you can attract people to that and sell
just based on your own values the
Creator economy is composed of
individuals Distributing value in the
form of content and products they
educate Their audience on the skills and
interests that will Aid in the
actualization of their goals their
products or services are meant to
generate results and move them faster
toward those goals so now we understand
the Society of the economy and but now
we need to understand my one-person
business philosophy so here's a quote
from Naval there are almost 7 billion
people on this planet someday I hope
there will be almost 7 billion companies
the best businesses change lives and
Transformations make a winning product
stop trying to solve imaginary problems
solve your own problems change your own
life package up the method slap a price
tag on it you're less likely to fail if
you solve real meaningful problems this
is the problem with most people entering
business they don't have an
understanding of Marketing sales
psychology or just evolution in general
so stop trying to land on Saturn and
build a billion dollar company when
that's not a real tangible problem
that's not going to make people's lives
better why are we trying to land on
Saturn when we can't even live on Earth
because the majority of the population
are still suffering from low
Consciousness problems and that is hold
the individuals that form the collective
are holding back the collective ego from
Enlightenment so I recommend starting as
a micro education business model to
actually solve real problems in your own
life and then distribute your solutions
to others there's a video I have called
the micro education business model
something like that because that's how
you contribute to the happiness and
evolution of humanity and you first
start doing this by understanding the
Eternal markets which is health wealth
relationships and happiness so by
solving your own problems in these
domains you push toward your own
self-actualization create a unique map
with your own story that you can pass
down and make an income by helping
others heal and achieve their goals from
there everyone is at a higher state of
consciousness we can do what we love
with our time and solve deeper problems
that we are passionate about like
landing on Saturn at that point so if
social media is the new Society then
personal brands are the people of that
society and no this is not limited to
those that have a business like even you
you have a social media account you're
just not contributing right you're not a
part of the economy so to say and you
are you're a consumer in the economy but
you don't understand that this is global
right that you can can you can be a part
of this it's not like a physical
location where there can only be a
hundred buildings in a specific lot you
have your own lot you just open it up
you want digital real estate sign up for
a website builder and put up a [ __ ]
website boom because creators small and
large are hiring people left and right
so are brands or corporations they're
hiring people that actually display
their value with their public resume
which is their profile or their content
social media is a public job board
public school public note taking system
and public party where you can find
friends and nurture business
relationships so to start a very good
option is to just work for another
Creator or brand in the economy to start
getting real world results with modern
skills that are going to be much more
necessary to start your own brand right
and I would argue that every single
skill that you can apply to your own
brand are the necessary skills that you
can apply to other people's Brands so by
working and building your own brand
you're stacking the most applicable
knowledge that is going to get you paid
the most when you go to work for someone
else if you want to at that point so
let's talk about the path to self-man
there are three paths and we're going to
break these all down but the first is
just the typical learn a skill sell
skill or learn a skill teach a skill
sell a skill this is what most people
recommend you do to start making money
fast is learn a modern skill that
creators or brands use in their business
like email marketing funnel design or
content writing create content based
around that skill to flex your knowledge
frankly this won't gain many followers
your profile will be more like a resume
and charge higher prices for a freelance
or Consulting service because you don't
have the audience or leverage to sell a
product in your sleep so for any of this
to work you're gonna have to learn the
Evergreen skills which is writing
speaking marketing and sales I talk
about that more in the 1 million dollar
offer Stack video so path number two is
to become a value Creator within your
interests so here is a graphic of what
the value Creator in my eyes actually
does if you want to stop and read this
I'd recommend it or you can screenshot
it for later this is difficult to
articulate the whole value Creator thing
because most people because most people
are at the place in their life where
they're just like I don't have any
interests because you've been force-fed
what to become interested in from school
from all of the problems we listed
earlier about the public school system
so let's start there how do you generate
interest in a topic you generate
interest in a topic by investing energy
into a goal that way you feel as if
you're wasting the investment if you
don't achieve that goal right you need
the pressure you need the pull you need
something on the line you need something
you need mental currency AKA Focus
invested in a goal so that you feel
pulled to actually achieve it and so
true goals are based around the Eternal
markets health wealth relationships
happiness in the pursuit of
self-actualization most other things are
just cheap desires they aren't really
true they are just kind of they're
fabricated wants that were projected
onto you and so the interests or skills
you learn along the way to the goal are
how you generate interest in something
because if someone achieves wants to
achieve a goal in health they're going
to find the path that is best for them
in a sense with some trial error so some
people with the pursuit of Health are
going to learn the interest of nutrition
or a specific diet within nutrition or
training so maybe they like bodybuilding
maybe they like running more maybe they
like cycling more and so all of these
little things and interests start to
culminate as you're achieving that goal
for the Health Market I can become
interested in sub-topics of nutrition
training and mental health so like
bodybuilding the ancestral diet
minimalist training yoga mindfulness for
the wealth Market I can become
interested in subtopics of business
career development and finance like
freelancing software as a service resume
building interview preparation budgeting
any skill listed in the previous section
and for the relationships Market I can
become interested in subtopics of social
dynamics dating and marriage like
couples therapy confidence and Charisma
Day game how to approach all of these
push me towards the development of each
area and this is how you become a
digital renaissance man you must become
a lifelong autodidact or self-learner if
you want want to be truly Irreplaceable
and you can learn anything in record
time faster than any of our ancestors
used to be able to just thanks to the
internet and courses and coaching and
all of the things that too many people
write off as oh that don't have
credentials they don't have results
whatever and so that was path one and
two learnerskill sell a skill and value
creation based on your interest but path
three and my ideal way of doing this
which is much more long term is do both
because as I said earlier with a
personal brand you will be forced to
learn most of the modern skills that
lead to any kind of brand or Creator
success you will have to build your own
landing pages funnels emails content
profile design graphics and the rest to
make your brand a success if it doesn't
help your brand grow it won't help
others and it isn't worth learning in
that case when you start getting results
for your own brand then you have the
experience to start helping people with
others in exchange for money the product
or service you wish to sell at this
point by practicing on your own brand
will usually be based around your
interests right so the way that I can
put this is like yeah if you're going to
learn a skill sell a skill route then
you build experience by working with
other people the same is true with
health wealth relationships whatever it
may be but let's say I want to go into
bodybuilding and so I get results for
myself because this is the one person
business personal brand and then I can
use those initial initial results to
create a product or service so like a
training program or health coaching or
whatever it may be and then from there I
can build my landing page my profile
write my content and start to invest
energy in this personal brand and decide
what I like to do the most do I like the
marketing do I like the graphic design
do I like the health the most and what
can I start to sell but you're
practicing selling the health related
interest because you already have
results within that domain and so a
obvious caveat here is that if you're
just sitting on your ass all day you're
not improving in any way shape or form
then you're not going to make money you
have to start now no I'm not going to
give you motivation to go and do this I
mean you have enough motivation the
universe is calling you to evolve
there's a poll there's a reason you feel
bad for not doing the things you're
supposed to be doing it's because it's
obvious that you need to do them and the
only way you're going to enjoy doing
them is from what we talked about
earlier you have to start invest energy
in the goal and then you feel as if
you're wasting that energy if you don't
actually complete it and along the way
that's the only way to expose yourself
to experience within reality to actually
find the things that allow you to keep
going the whys or the reasons in short
stagnation equals Death and if you
choose to do nothing with your life
that's how you become a cog in the
machine because all Human Action is goal
oriented and clearly you're going to
keep walking around moving and doing
things and you're going to have to
survive so you're gonna go along the
default path until you work a job that
you hate until you finally hit that low
point and decide to bounce out of it you
might as well start now so now let's
talk about the four pillars of a
six-figure one-person business for brand
tell a story for Content make a map for
product create a game that is a tweet of
mine that I felt very insightful writing
in the past but here's the thing the one
person business model can have so many
different interpretations and
definitions right it's just a concept
it's just made up there's no actual
thing that is the one person business
model it's an idea and now that I have a
small team I can't really call myself
it's weird calling myself a one-person
business and so because of that I'm
going to redefine it so that I can
continue calling myself a one-person
business and on top of that just like
little tangent here is that I pushed a
bit too far into a business model that I
didn't like going after and it made me
realize what I don't want which I talk
about all the time and how it made me
realize what I want so I'm actively
trying to get back to just being one
person with like a VA a small team is
good and I like it but I've realized
what I want above all else I want to
write and I want to take on creative
challenges with my writing that is what
gives me energy for the rest of the day
and of course I want to work on my
health I want to maintain my lifestyle
and routine that I love but the main
thing first thing in the morning is just
writing in creative challenges the
income reflects that but at the same
time it's like I know that there's going
to become a decrease in income from me
peeling back my business so I can do
that and focus solely on that and write
more books and write more content and
just really Flex my mind and try to
advance understanding in the topics that
I like talking about so for the sake of
collective and shared definition we're
going to consider the one person
business as turning yourself into a
business if you want to hire a VA or
Freelancers or contractors like I don't
have any employees right now it's just a
few contractors that I hire for odd jobs
so I give you permission not that it
matters because I'm not the gatekeeper
of one person businesses and so the one
person business concept is a novel way
of grabbing attention and saying become
high value and put yourself out there
until enough people know who you are
what you do and why you do it
opportunities will compound in a
nutshell that's all you really need to
do to succeed so here are the four
pillars the first is brand you are the
niche and so here's a graphic of the one
person business again pause screenshot
whatever but we're going to go over this
but it may help just to go over it for
like big picture so your personal brand
is yourself or identity in the new
Society your identity is the underlying
story that shapes your perspective your
perspective contains goals from which
you perceive situations these goals can
be assigned to you via social
conditioning in your upbringing or they
can be self-generated in alignment with
your vision when you read a book any
book you are going to interpret it
differently from another person just
because you have different goals that
are more prevalent in your life because
if I read the book awareness by Anthony
Demello at a financial low point in my
life I'm going to absorb the ideas that
will most help me get out of that whole
financial whole and then if I read it
where I'm at a spiritual low point is
really going to help with that because
it's a spiritual book but what about a
relationship slow point then it'll help
with that right and I'm going to
interpret the ideas based on the burning
problems in my life and so another
person that reads it at a relationship
high in their life are going to absorb
the ideas that will allow them to
reinforce that and keep it going and
possibly nurture the relationship so two
people that read the same book at
different points in their life or their
story are going to have different
insights that come from reading the
actual book itself so in order to create
you must consume and just by consuming
stuff and being able to distribute your
ideas without trying to fit it into any
box that's how you create unique content
that's how you create a unique brand
it's not that hard but you have to be
pursuing goals you have to be building
things if you're stagnant no wonder you
can't generate ideas it's because
everything's just going in and out in
one year out the whatever the [ __ ] the
saying is so your brand is your vision
for the future and that evolves as you
do if you want to make it simpler it's
your goal that you're working towards
the goal for your life or the goal for
the next year of your life whatever it
is what are you leading people towards
right the goal what's the intention of
you what's the intention of your brand
by Leading people towards something
that's how you attract followers if
you're not doing anything in life then
you're not going to attract followers
pillar number two is content or
documenting your mind I like to think of
social media as a public note taking
system where you jot down what you are
learning and how it applies to your life
your thoughts and opinions on your
skills and interests and the lessons you
are learning throughout the story of
life without knowing it we are actively
building out the collective
Consciousness online in an explorable
Fashion on the internet but you can't
just write things and pray that they
grow your brand you have to study the
Evergreen skills you have to be building
your brand so a goal right building
towards that while learning about
Marketing sales copywriting Etc
everything that's going to grow the
brand so you have something to apply it
to and so if you want to learn these
things and actually start building it I
would recommend the free portion of
digital economics I I believe that's a
course within itself that's worth more
than most other people's courses so if
you go to the digital economics landing
page there's an email sign up at the top
just entered it there you'll get an
email to log into the free course and
now of course the rest of it like the
actual systems and my philosophies and
everything that I do that's a more
expensive part of the course the entire
course isn't free so if you don't want
that cool if you do check it out and now
if you have no idea what to learn I'm
just going to tell you straight up start
learning Marketing sales copywriting and
direct response marketing from those
lens because that alone will change your
life and I know this is a cringe book
title I know that it may have some bad
connotations with it but digital
millionaire Secrets really helped me
understand and grasp what was going on
online from the lens of like marketing
it could be seen as like pushy salesman
whatever but you don't have to perceive
it that way right you can take the
lessons from it and use it ethically and
I would recommend doing that it's
actually a pretty short read but very
very insightful and I've talked a lot
about these big principles in previous
videos like value creation the single
skill That Built My one-person business
that is a great starting point as well
so pillar number three is a product or
public personal projects under the
one-person business philosophy you
contribute to the new Society by solving
your own problems and selling the
solution here's the progression identify
a problem in your life turn it into a
personal project for experience turn it
into a minimum viable offer start
selling for 500 to a thousand with
freelancing or Consulting build your
audience along the way with content
increase the depth and complexity of
your offer productize it when you feel
ready so it can sell in your sleep this
will take about one to three years so if
your goal is to make money in business
or your career then you can learn a
skill like email marketing and if your
goal is to increase your attraction and
confidence and get ripped then you can
go to the gym and fix your nutrition and
then once you do once you've achieved
some form of progress within that you
can start talking about it identifying
knowledge gaps because you won't know
how to articulate your points or you'll
get challenged by someone online and are
forced to learn more about what it is
that you're learning and then you can
start teaching people as well either for
free or a small price tag because the
value that you ask for the money has to
reflect the amount of value that you can
give so if you're not an absolute expert
with a ton of results then you can't
charge a super high price tag and that's
fine you're gonna have to start lower
and work your way up as you gain
experience so where does a project come
into play projects are how you actually
solve problems in the real world they
force you to apply what you learn
they're also tangible they are your
result you can iterate on them and get
better with time you can reflect on them
and make it easier to achieve for the
next person so with email marketing you
can create an email sequence for your
own brand you can either do it for an
affiliate product so you have something
to sell when you don't have anything to
sell or you can practice on your
favorite books or products or if you
create a product based around your
interest like if I'm interested in
productivity I can go and create a
planner without any prior experience
because the way you get results is just
by putting something on the market if
you don't have anything on the market
then you're not going to be able to get
results and you're not going to be able
to refine it to get better results and
so once you do that you can start to
craft persuasive argument around them in
your email marketing sequences and
actually practice the writing speaking
Marketing sales that you're learning
applied through a results-oriented skill
like email marketing and then from there
from that portfolio piece that you have
you can then create something better
because you have to be able to iterate
on something for it to be better and if
you don't have anything that you've
created before then you can't improve it
and so now you can go to like a brand
and do a permissionless apprenticeship
type deal where you write their email
sequences for them or you create a
health program for them or whatever it
may be and you just send it to them and
you'd be like hey I uh I made this for
you take it and do what you will if you
want to use it and see if you get
results cool if not whatever just leave
it at that don't be needy don't try and
make the sale opportunities will come to
you that way I promise and another way
to do this if you have something visual
is you can post it and tag them if
you're targeting a big Creator let's say
you make a landing page for them make
sure it's good so you don't get
embarrassed online and you post a
landing page onto the timeline and you
tag them like on Twitter you post an
image of it and then if they like it at
least they're gonna comment like retweet
and then you can grow your audience that
way even if they don't use the landing
page that you built for them and even
then they just spread you to Their
audience and so you'll have people that
are actually interested in landing page
design and if they like your designs
then they're going to go into your DMs
and ask to hire you so pillar number
four is marketing or selling to yourself
because you won't make a single penny if
you never self-promote it's obvious
because people ask me from a state of
stress worry and overwhelm because
they're not self-promoting why they're
not making any money and it's because
they're not self-promoting they're not
even giving themselves a chance to get
results or money and they focus on doing
everything that doesn't result in making
more money and marketing exists across
the entirety of your brand but is most
prevalent in your landing pages for your
products and services your emails where
you promote them your content where you
promote them and your Outreach messages
where you see if others are a fit for
them again I've talked about this all
before in previous one-person business
videos there's a playlist for that and I
give my exact systems out into our
writer and digital economics courses so
let's just go over a framework that you
can practice with and that understand
that I can't just go over every single
nuance and thing here you have to take
the framework view it for what it is the
essence of each part and be able to
apply it to literally everything in your
brand so the first thing is to identify
their goals or desired outcome and I'm
talking about the person that you're
trying to sell a product or service to
or just someone that you're trying to
promote to because you have to know what
your audience wants and you have to make
it top of mind for them by talking about
it in your content promotions or just
bringing it up to them in the DMs like
what are you building right now I'm
interested in that what's your goal
that's literally the best starting point
for any conversation is like Hey Dude
Looks Like You're Building something
cool mind if I ask more about it what's
this thing that you're building what's
this website what's this content what's
this interest that you're talking about
ask questions you become interesting by
being interested in other people and For
the Love of All Things holy like oh my
gosh don't be so robotic with this like
just be a normal person text like if
you're texting a friend people want that
authenticity where my editor Devin has
people from my community and I try to
make this clear and everything thing
that I write they'll DM him like a pitch
and it's just like the most washed down
thing in the world and it's like you
don't think that people can like see
through that it's like dude just say hey
what the [ __ ] is up man I I want to get
to know you what are you working towards
what's this thing you're building is
there any way I can help with it just be
a genuine human being so the next thing
once you understand what their goal is
you have to under you have to identify
what is standing in the way what is the
reason people aren't achieving their
goals what is the reason you didn't
achieve the goal at the start write it
out in your promotions or ask the person
you were talking to in your Outreach
messages an example what's preventing
you from achieving the goal that they
mentioned right you have to understand
what's the pain Point what's stopping
them from overcoming it you're digging
deeper into why they aren't achieving
the goal and if that goal is actually
desirable to them then they're going to
become more aware of the problem in
their life and so the last thing from
this state of them having goal top of
Mind understanding that they aren't
going to be able to reach it themselves
you present Your solution as a way to
solve that burning problem and so now
that you know about the goal all in
what's standing in the way you
understand whether they are a fit for
you or not if they are not a fit leave
it alone don't try to sell them if they
are a fit then just present it it's like
hey man I have this service or product
and I think it really helped do you want
to hear more about it and so something
you can ask here as well is ask them how
their life would be impacted if they
don't reach the goal that they're trying
to achieve right you have to make them
realize what is actually going to make
them move people move when there is a
problem in their life that they are
aware of like really aware of and how
it's impacting their life so if their
goal is to make more money and there's
something standing in the way like oh I
don't have the time or I don't know how
to actually start or I just don't have a
business model that fits me it's like
okay I have a solution for that
personally the one person business model
I can teach you about it for 500 bucks
over the course of two calls and then I
ask like what's like if you don't do
this like how's it going to impact your
life and you can even resonate with them
here where it's like yeah man I
understand that I when I didn't have
this business or I wasn't making enough
money it really impacted me in this this
in this way like does that resin at all
with you and then they answer it and
you're like okay well like this wasn't
initially meant to be a Pitch but it
feels like I should at least put this on
your radar my product or service like do
you want to hear more about it and so to
practice all of that like just
communication and being a normal person
in general I have the non-needy
networking process video that you can go
and watch that walks you through it and
that also helps with like how to grow
your brand without or like in an
authentic way and frankly that's all you
really need to know about the one person
business model for now that's big
picture understanding some practical
advice but that's all you really need
like go take a course or something
invest in your self-education contribute
to the Creator economy because if you're
going to ask for money from it but
you're not putting money into it that's
kind of selfish like you shouldn't
really try to join the new society that
way you need to actually contribute by
putting money into it because you
believe in it you're investing in it and
you're putting pressure on the line for
yourself to actually be a part of that
Society slash economy of course uh I've
made previous videos on this all the
time the one person business model
playlist you can go and watch it aside
from that the art of focus book will be
launching soon stoked about that uh
