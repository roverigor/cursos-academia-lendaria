when I first started out in business I
felt like freelancing was the only
option because I didn't feel
authoritative enough to start a personal
brand and I didn't have enough money to
buy product for an e-commerce store I
didn't even know what Consulting was
like I didn't understand the term and so
agency and freelance work are marketed
towards beginners and it's for good
reason it's because one the education is
free with the internet you can learn
pretty much any skill you want now
learning Marketing sales and offer
creation how to package that up is a bit
of a different story right that's where
courses and other things come into play
how to use those skills in a specific
business model a new business model that
college can't teach you to run and with
an agency or freelancing you don't need
to invest time or money in building some
form of traffic like SEO to your website
or building an audience uh like a
following of course that helps a lot and
I highly recommend doing that from the
start but you don't need it right you
can learn some Outreach strategies and
some cold email and some LinkedIn
prospecting and you can get your clients
that way and lastly you only need three
to four clients a month right you're not
selling a product so you don't need to
make like a hundred sales a month to
even pull in some form of an income all
you really need is to improve your skill
set over time iterate on your service
get three to four clients increase your
prices and boom you're making more money
than ninety percent of the population
and so that was a no-brainer for me
that's why I started off with
freelancing and attempted to to do
multiple different things with it right
SEO web design all of the above and I
still think it is an incredible option
for beginners I talk about this all the
time but if I were to go back and do
something different I just recommend
that people start posting online
providing value attracting clients that
way showing that you are an authority
and building leverage via a personal
brand in a following so you aren't left
with nothing when you inevitably decide
hey I'm done with this freelancing stuff
where do I go next and if you've only
been doing Outreach to clients you're
 and so 36 36 of the workforce are
Freelancers right they do freelance gigs
and with the future of work and my
predictions and the way the world is
moving with AI automation I genuinely
believe that that number 36 percent of
the workforce of Freelancers is going to
Skyrocket to 90 percent Plus
I like making delusional predictions
everyone will be a freelancer because
the state of work will demand it right
companies will realize why am I paying
for this in-house paying this guy a
full-time salary for the same amount of
work that I could pay one freelancer
1500 bucks to do as one client they save
so much cost and Freelancers themselves
can make more money by taking on more
clients it just makes sense and so that
is everyone will be a freelancer until
they decide they want to evolve into a
Creator and they can start by doing this
right now with what we're going to talk
about in this video the micro business
model that we're going to talk about and
still the options are endless with
freelancing or any of this right the
niches that you can go into are endless
there's endless skills to learn and
stack there's endless Outreach
strategies to test and content writing
tactics and it's no wonder that the
online business world is so overwhelming
every single step you take you think
you're making progress just to be met
with another roadblock that causes a
bunch of overwhelming uncertainty just
right when you got out of that phase
because it's all so new think about it
this whole online business stuff and
anything that we've been talking about
here has only been actually prevalent
for maybe a decade maybe and that's
insane on the grand Scale of the
Universe and so this is why I talk about
how College isn't going to teach you any
of this right they can't catch up with a
decade's worth of curriculum like that
fast and so for those that think
freelancing is their only option or
they're going to start freelancing I
want to show you a new path that you can
either take instead of freelancing or
you can use it to help you evolve Beyond
freelancing right but first we have to
shed some limiting beliefs education
businesses are the most meaningful
business models for beginners people
love to talk bad about education
businesses right info products courses
YouTube content creation information
because people think that it's just a
bunch of dudes like off in the corner
circle jerking each other scamming
people and manipulating because
information is in and tangible right and
people that have bought courses
understand how life-changing they can be
and if you even if you bought a 50
course and it wasn't that good but it's
still information they still delivered
on the promise right and you're gonna
label it as a scam I don't see a problem
with that right go ahead talk bad about
the courses that are bad but at the same
time it's like it's 50 bucks most
college courses are complete dog
and nobody complains about spending two
thousand dollars just because it's
conditioned into their head that that's
what they should be doing and excuse my
language because I get very passionate
about this because education businesses
have helped me so much not only because
I have one and I recommend that everyone
should have one because everyone the
information in people's heads are unique
watch the video you have a 100 000
product stuck in your head but at the
same time it's changed the course of my
life I would not have my anything in my
entire lifestyle if it weren't for me
being able to learn online from people
that I aspire to be like since I was a
child
that changed the entire direction of my
life and so in reality education
businesses are the most results-oriented
business models out there because think
about it it's like people complain about
paying fifty dollars for a course but
then you're gonna go and spend fifteen
thousand to fifty thousand to seventy
five thousand dollars on a watch and
think that it's any more valuable than
the information that you hold in your
mind that influences every single action
you take in this world and the success
you have
henceforth from it and here's the thing
you will only find new specific and
relevant information from courses in the
Creator economy that's just how it is
and so most are just impatient right you
buy a 50 course you see a little promise
they're like oh I made six figures doing
this I made Seven figures doing this I
try to preface everything with it's
going to take like three to five years
right that's even in one of my YouTube
titles but at the same time it's like
people right now would rather get a sub
six-figure job that isn't a promise by
going a four to eight years of
University to learn the same curriculum
as every other person going there
instead of learning from a decentralized
individual teaching what they know
because they've gotten results from it
right professors sometimes maybe they've
gotten results but they're hired by the
school system to teach the school system
because they went through the school
system and they were a good student and
so rather than learning from an
individual for 50 bucks or maybe five
thousand dollars for coaching for the
exact information you need that align
with your interests in order to make
that a part of your life it's invaluable
and so to get a bit of evolutionary
psychology e here to understand the
importance of information we have to
understand the importance of evolution
and survival right so animals they seek
to replicate the information in their
genes as do we but we've also
transcended that plane of existence and
we try to survive the information in our
Consciousness right so the ideas the
beliefs uh and everything else that we
subscribe to that form our concept of
self who we are and so we don't only try
to survive our physical form but our
mental form which is who we are it's
ourself and so we do this by projecting
and communicating the ideas and beliefs
that we hold in our minds at any given
moment right when I'm communicating
right now I am replicating ideas into
you that will help form your sense of
self and your sense of self forms your
perspective which forms how you perceive
situations which forms how you make
decisions within those situations right
so if you're watching someone else who's
just
like throwing out all this garbage and
putting poison into your minds and
you're just gonna sit there and do
nothing and do nothing with your life
but you're watching this and hopefully I
am replicating myself into you I'm
spiritually impregnating you if you will
to do something better with your life
because that's exactly what parents do
as well as they are raising them as they
are teaching them and educating them
they are putting pieces of themselves
their self their mental form into their
children and so are the teachers and so
is every single other person that comes
into contacting communicates with them
and so you could argue that education is
what creates better selves in this world
and it goes on to impact the collective
well-being
of the society and civilization
education is the pillar of progress and
evolution education changes human
behavior education creates useful people
that contribute to society earn more and
create jobs the education industry will
only continue to grow and those that
don't accept it may be left behind start
an education business I don't care who
you are start one with a personal brand
and contribute to the Future that's
where this that's where all of this is
heading find a problem learn how to
solve it document how you solved it
distill into a replicable process give
it to others that want to be helped do
it offline and it's called Improvement
do it online and it's called business a
Creator banks on three pillars
inspiration education and entertainment
and so now there are solely
entertainment creators like Mr Beast
there are also Soul uh inspiration
creators or accounts like a millionaire
motivation theme page but I like to take
the holistic approach right you have to
Encompass all three in the message that
you're putting out to the world to
attract the audience that you want to
attract so Joe Rogan is an example of
this he is just he just is himself and
he educates people on what he knows he
inspires people with his story and he
entertains people just with his humor
and so I also do this like unconsciously
I had to reflect and think about how I
incorporate all three of these but it's
like I entertain people with my
philosophical musings or my evolutionary
psychology takes and then I use my
personal experience and my story of
building businesses to inspire people
and then I educate people on what I've
learned along the way through the
courses that I bought the things that
I've done and just what I enjoy studying
and so the usage of all three of these
or the blending of these is what makes
you the niche you are the most
profitable Niche go and watch that video
it's a good one the future belongs to
those that hold them most mental real
estate right in other words it belongs
to those that capture and hold the most
attention right so Tick Tock ain't gonna
cut it because you're holding Maybe
10 seconds of someone's attention and
that's all you get to uh communicate
your message with and spread your sense
of self and influence their actions with
in a ethical Mutual mutually beneficial
and conducive manner to a good future so
Yoon at you as a Creator and an educator
need to focus on having your ideas stick
in the back of people's minds because
you can hold more attention with a
newsletter a YouTube video a Twitter
thread an Instagram Carousel which we'll
talk about but as a whole you should be
focused on how your ideas stick in
people's heads right because uh when I'm
in a emotional rut then I'll think back
to the power of now with Eckhart Tolle
and think of one of the big ideas from
his book right and how it helps me and I
will go on to recommend Eckhart Tolle
and the Power of Now to other people who
are experiencing the same problems right
because his ideas were so good and they
helped me so much and they changed my
behavior and he replicated a part of
himself in my mind through education
that I attribute my progress to him and
who knows how much money I've indirectly
made him just from who I've recommended
it to who they've recommended it to and
the network layers out this probably
thousands of thousands of people
that I have told about the Power of Now
that have went and paid him ten dollars
three thousand times ten bucks thirty
thousand is probably more than that
honestly stop thinking of content as a
means to income will your ideas be
mentioned in a top 10 podcast episode
will your ideas be in the intro of a
best-selling book will your ideas be
mentioned in viral videos in tight-knit
newsletters right for impact and the
income will come and so in order to do
this you must develop yourself you must
develop your mind your cognitive ability
because personal development is about
solving your own problems business is
about solving other people's problems
the internet collapses both into one and
allows you to earn from solving your own
problems and living with purpose so
develop yourself document the solutions
via in education business and help
develop others by treating your life as
your life's work you go on to change the
course of humanity for the better so now
I want to talk about the three-point
micro business model I do not want to
overwhelm you I want to give you
actionable steps that you can use to
actually start a business today and let
the momentum compound and snowball over
one two three years of iteration and
persistence into something absolutely
incredible right a mass following that
will pay for your services and pay for
your expertise and you will be able to
pass along and have a meaningful
business and just lifestyle teaching
these people something that is helpful
to them and so as the path of Mastery
goes it starts as difficult and becomes
more pleasurable with time things aren't
going to make sense at the start you're
going to start a newsletter and be like
what do I write I can't do this you're
going to waste a week of just
overwhelming your mind stick it out
seriously trust me stick it out people
quit after two weeks because they just
don't have the sticking power and the
people that have the sticking power
without needing a dedicated answer or oh
like how do I overcome this without
needing that absolute clarity the people
that do that are the ones that succeed
the people that think it's a scam
because they didn't see immediate
results
are idiots
kindly I say that kindly so the process
that we're going to go over is pretty
simple it's start a newsletter write the
newsletter condense that into a thread
Instagram Carousel or any other
repurposable thing turn those into
tweets let the tweets go and of course
you repurpose these two different
platforms as well you see which ones
perform the best you turn that into a
newsletter and you repeat the cycle for
years and years and years until you
develop a philosophy that people love to
read about right My Philosophy is the
one person business model and a bunch of
philosophical Concepts to back that and
so this structure the micro business
model of newsletter thread tweet that
forms your like traffic Source your
content ecosystem that generates traffic
that you can send to your products or
Services we're not going to talk too
much about products or Services you can
go watch uh the best business model to
make one million in three to five years
or any of the videos in the one person
business series playlist and this is
what most of Twitter's specifically
successful people run on right because
they're writers and so they start with
newsletter thread at tweets and then
they just keep that flywheel because
then they have like long medium and
short form content holding the most
attention and uh delivering the best
ideas to people's minds so the first
thing is to start a newsletter and
nobody wants to start a newsletter
because they don't want to write to zero
subscribers and that's exactly why you
should start one nobody is watching and
would you rather write to nobody and get
the out before you start writing to
5 000 people and never actually send the
newsletter because you're afraid of what
they're gonna think of your shitty
letter because you didn't do it earlier
you didn't get better and so why should
you care about writing a newsletter
first it develops the most Authority
short form content only holds so much
attention and that means you make the
most sales from long-form content you
own the audience you acquire social
media platforms can go down at any time
so your newsletter is like the Hub and
this is where you sell your products or
services to people that care about you
rather than spamming social media and
looking scammy right lot of people are
concerned with this where it's like I
don't want to create a product I don't
want to talk about my service online
then create a newsletter and only pitch
it to the people that care about you and
so long form content should be the
pillar of your business because it
forces you to develop depth behind your
ideas it forces you to actually educate
people and not just write a 280
character Post in the form of Instagram
or Tick Tock or shorts or tweets or
whatever it may be you're not building
much Authority that way you're building
some right it's not black or white but
you're not building as much as you could
you're not making as much sales as you
could you're not nurturing your audience
and educating them as much as you could
and so how do you start writing a
newsletter a high quality newsletter is
first is you hunt for high performing
ideas because frankly it's not the
animations even though I now have an
animation agency because it really does
help with top of funnel Instagram growth
that's how I got from 250 000 to 1.4
million but the ideas matter the most so
if you're interested in that link in the
description for serious creators only
that want to grow fast on Instagram but
it's not the captions on the clips like
Alex hormozzi does it's not the Tweet
structures it's not the specific YouTube
video structure it's not the perfect bio
it's not the most colorful thumbnail
it's the ideas people collect from
someone they like so to find High
performing ideas filter your favorite
YouTubers videos by most popular and
study the titles sign up for medium.com
select your interests and study your
homepage suggestions headlines daily
read books until a novel idea catches
your attention write it down and use it
in your writing videos or speaking and
so my absolute favorite way to do this
is by studying top tweets of all things
because tweets are just ideas right
they're digestible ideas and they're
time tested they're so good people sleep
on Twitter like crazy if you're not on
Twitter Twitter and you're a Creator
you're really missing out and so I
personally use tweet Hunter this is how
I like schedule all my content uh
specifically on Twitter because Twitter
is a testing ground for my ideas I write
everything on Twitter post three times a
day and then I choose the best ones and
turn that into other content that
usually performs pretty well right and
so I use tweet Hunter to type in the
accounts that I like look at their top
tweets right it will show you their top
tweets and then you can use that for
idea generation to make sure that your
ideas are validated before you go and
write them in your own words so the next
thing you can do after hunting for high
performing ideas is to study Frameworks
and use them as training wheels so now
that you have an idea you need to
practice articulating it in a persuasive
and structured manner that holds
people's attention so in other words you
need to write it in a way that
illustrates or implies their pains
problems goals and the solution between
both of those and so I wrote about that
in depth in the value creation video
right value creation the skill that
built the single skill that built the
entirety of my one person business so
study top performing tweets deconstruct
what they look like and why they work
and practice writing it with your unique
idea study small copywriting Frameworks
like Pas and Ada to tap into human
psychology you can Google those for long
form study Pastore or the systems I give
out in my course the two-hour writer
links in the description as with all of
this consume social media and marketing
content from the lens of a Creator not a
consumer and again practice ideas are
only impactful if they are consumed
right if your ideas aren't read because
you don't know how to structure an idea
and actually capture and hold attention
then they're never gonna see it and
you're not going to get following you're
not going to get paid so the next thing
you can do with a newsletter after you
write it is to distribute it to all
platforms you can use it as a YouTube
script most people wing it and the
videos fall flat right this is I'm
reading I'm using my newsletter as a
soft script here and no nobody cares
that it's just a repeat right they
prefer that people want to be reminded
more than they need something new
it just works the people that don't care
like if you care that I read my
newsletter from my phone unsubscribe I
don't want you here but I do love you
either way if you stay or leave that
sounded mean I'm On One upload it to a
Blog so you can repost it for life if it
has your products or Services that's how
you sell them so what I do is I upload
each newsletter and embed my YouTube
video in a blog post and then anytime on
social media I can plug it under a tweet
or in my Instagram story any of the
posts and then if my products or
services are linked in there not only is
my YouTube growing but my email list is
growing and people are visiting my
products or services and if I do that on
a daily basis that's how I make an
income all right so after you write a
newsletter I would start by making it
like make it like a thousand words right
don't make it too long maybe 1500 I go
pretty long but just make it a thousand
fifteen hundred words and then the
second thing you're going to do is
you're going to condense the main points
into a Twitter thread so why a Twitter
thread well first you have to understand
medium form content if you want to stand
out on short form top of funnel
platforms like Twitter Instagram
um LinkedIn then you have to understand
that longer form content builds more
Authority and leads to more growth and
more sales so so you are missing out if
you are not writing Twitter threads that
you can then repurpose into an Instagram
Carousel that you can go and repurpose
into a LinkedIn post and then you can
fuel your YouTube or your newsletter or
your blog from those things because
they're generating so much traffic if
you understand social media growth and
so I write a Twitter thread by taking
the main ideas from my newsletter
outlining a shorter and more concise
post writing it as a Twitter thread
because you are forced to condense your
ideas to be the most valuable and
keeping the thread to 10 to 15 Tweets in
length maximum that way they can be
turned into an Instagram or LinkedIn
Carousel with a few minutes of effort
easy and so the longer you hold
attention with newsletters and threads
the more perceived value your brand has
to Any Given individual and so the third
thing is to break it off into short form
so we talked about this earlier but
short form is your mechanism for growth
and testing ideas and by short form I
mean like tweets Instagram posts tick
tocks reels shorts LinkedIn posts but
short order that kind of stuff regular
posts because every single part of your
thread and many parts in your newsletter
can be turned into Standalone posts and
then you can plug the newsletter or the
YouTube video under that that is related
to that topic and then you have your
products or services in there and that's
how you make sales right it's just an
endless content flywheel of traffic
circulation and nurturing your audience
so almost all of my newsletter ideas
which are then turned into YouTube and
blog
were taken from my top performing tweets
right many of you have seen this and
most of my video well all of my videos
are newsletters but the shorter ones are
from my threads that I write from high
performing tweets right so if you aren't
writing short form content if you don't
have this entire three-point business
model in check then you are missing out
on
a lot of potential growth and just ease
of uh transferring content to all
platforms and so since that that's the
thing here right is because I tested the
ideas on Twitter I knew they did well
and Twitter's the easiest platform to
grow on if you understand what you're
doing or you go through my links in the
description for help because this is
just one video there's only so much I
can go over like it's not a course where
I have a billion different pages and
strategies and stuff like that right but
since my tweets performed well better
than others that means I know that my
YouTube videos and newsletters and
threads and everything else that stems
from them and leading back into them are
going to perform better and then
increase and compound and go exponential
with time so that's the first thing that
three-point business model is for
building distribution or traffic to send
to a product or service that's how you
monetize and so everything above will
form the levers for what you do on a
weekly and daily basis right writing
newsletters writing threads writing
tweets and then repurposing if you want
to so as you're building that
distribution or that track traffic then
you need to start to think of okay how
am I going to monetize once you actually
have it growing so I've spoken about
monetization methods a billion times
before but you study your interests you
start a service business you grow an
audience you work for free you develop
your process you increase prices you
repeat five through six you productize
your process and you scale your audience
and your income scales with it as you
evolve but with this three-part micro
business approach there are a few
different ways to go about this right so
Sean Puri for example I believe that's
how you say his name he started a
newsletter business where he had about
100K subscribers and he was making fifty
thousand dollars a month from
sponsorships from that so if you build a
newsletter you reach out for
sponsorships and they pay a lot of money
I promise especially if you're in a like
a decent Niche where the sponsorships
are and then if you film your newsletter
as a YouTube video and you grow on
YouTube then you expect you can accept
sponsorships there as well because when
I think about this I heard this the
other day max tuning a fitness guy he
does he gets a good amount of views per
video but he said that he only makes a
hundred thousand dollars per year from
like AdSense and monetization but with
sponsorships he makes a million dollars
a year right so sponsorships can make
you a lot of money but
creating your own products for service
will always make you the most money and
so if you have the sponsorships and you
have the AdSense and whatever it is you
just create a digital product like
Justin Welsh who he has two 150 products
based on the things that he's done he
literally just created a product because
he knew how to grow an audience and that
adds another million dollar a year
Revenue stream of course when you're on
Justin Walter's level but still even
people that get like a 10K a month
Revenue stream that's life-changing and
so literally the only thing you have to
do is just build an audience and then
focus and learn about monetization along
the way teach what you learn create a
product or service promote and then
you're good to go build distribution
then build whatever you want shout out
Jack butcher because you have infinite
monetization options in this day and age
like once you just build an audience
like opportunities are thrown at you
people are like hire me I like your
content I'll pay you three thousand
dollars for coaching do you have a
product where I can learn more about
this hey we want to sponsor your
newsletter like you literally just have
to put yourself on the market by doing
the things that telling you to do give
value build distribution ask to get paid
that is it before you leave I have an
actual important message so I've been
told many times digital economics it is
underpriced it's kind of expensive
already but I am doubling the price okay
so solopreneur Sprints the cohort starts
on May 15th around that date at that
time digital economics is going to be
doubling in Price Right digital
economics houses solopreneur Sprints so
if you want to get in on this month's
cohort or maze cohort then purchase
digital economics while the price is
still technically cut in half that's all
I have to say for now I'll talk about it
more in future videos join the
newsletter if you actually want updates
but aside from that like subscribe hope
you enjoyed the video
see ya
