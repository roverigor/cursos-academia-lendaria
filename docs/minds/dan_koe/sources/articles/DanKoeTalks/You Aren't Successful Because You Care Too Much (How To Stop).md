stop caring about others opinions when
you trust yourself with your future that
is a lot to unpack lack of confidence is
the one thing that plagues the potential
of the majority of the population they
care too much about what others think
let's say you want to start a business
and the thoughts start to flood in what
will my parents think what will my
friends think what will my spouse think
will it be enough to replace my income
how long will it take and don't even get
me started on the thoughts that start
coming when you actually start building
the business the reason people fail is
they can't lift the emotional weights
required to achieve the goals they set
for every thought of a better life there
are 100 negative thoughts beating you
back down and that's just about business
what about the other 60 to 80 000
thoughts that humans have on average
every day we have a lot on our plate
will I come off as weird when I try to
make new friends where will I end up in
life if I don't get my debt under
control did I feed the dog this morning
imagine how terrible of a pet owner
people will think I am if they found out
developing self-confidence is no easy
task more information more
responsibilities and more options for
future turns confidence into success and
anxiety into failure this is the modern
environment that we live in so how do we
start to cultivate that self-trust that
leads to self-confidence the four
pillars of self-confidence first is
perspective so you can realize that
nobody is special the second is
perception so you can act on
opportunities the third is practice so
you don't shy away from Challenge and
the fourth is authenticity so you don't
conform to others opinions when most
people wonder how they can start to
become more confident they're reminded
of the simplistic advice confidence
equals competence so the learn and learn
never act never self-reflect and never
actually develop confidence as a skill
in any situation this is the most common
outcome there is depth behind that
simple statement that people can't see
so we must seek to understand that
statement because clearly confidence
equals comp tense as general advice has
not fixed the biggest problem in the
world but it has made it worse so pillar
one is perspective when you enter a new
situation where you don't feel confident
anxiety shoots through the roof this
closes your mind to everything but your
thoughts they multiply you completely
retract from the situation and become a
slave to your past you focus too much on
the experiences you've had before pull
those feelings into the present moment
and you remain the same person by not
breaking that cycle you have to snap out
of this and make a conscious effort to
reprogram your way of habitually acting
to situations to do this when you enter
a situation and anxiety Sparks pause
zoom out to see the situation for what
it is it's just a normal situation
transfer Consciousness to those in the
situation with you transferring
Consciousness is adopting another
person's perspective because most people
are just living the same experience as
us billionaires are people with the same
problems fitness models are people with
the same problems any person you
mentally place above you has the same
problems the one thing that will make
them react in a negative way to you is
treating them as if they aren't a normal
person just like you and so when you
come off with a lack of confidence in a
situation to other people you're not
getting a negative reaction because
you're overly confident or you're good
at being yourself it's because of the
opposite they can sense that something
is off and that you are unconfident or
that you're projecting into this
imaginary future of where that situation
will lead and remember that this is a
habit you are forming is pausing zooming
out and gaining perspective it will take
practice and repetition in real life
this one video isn't going to fix it
immediately for you and you cannot
advance to the other pillars that we're
going to talk about without first trying
to adopt this as a habit so pillar
number two is perception how you
perceive situations determines how you
act this requires that you shift to an
open-minded State before and maintain it
during the situation if you're scrolling
social media and don't perceive a
business owner's tweet as an opportunity
to reach out you won't reach out and you
won't make money if you don't land him
as a client that's in the case of like
freelancing if you do see it as an
opportunity you still May botch the
message or not send one at all because
you misperceive that individual the same
goes for making new friends and engaging
in new situations and perception goes
two ways here right people you have to
be able to see beyond how people present
themselves or how they are holding
themselves like as an example at the
apartment complex here when I first
moved in I well first off I'm just very
stoked to begin with I'm very like
straight I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do
if I'm going outside to go on a walk I'm
going outside to go on a walk and so
when I was passing by people and I just
was beelining and as I passed them and
they're like hi and I was just like oh
hey what's up and then like kept walking
but after talking to that person later
meeting them like after they would
mention they would always mentioned that
I'm very like intimidating like they
don't want to say anything because I
feel they feel like I'm so focused on
something and but in my mind if people
say hi I'm perfectly fine with it I'll
stop and I'll have the conversation
it'll be upbeat and happy about it but
you have to be able to perceive the
situation in a sense where you can act
regardless of how the other person is
going to respond to it and you need to
understand that most people are going to
respond positively to you interacting
with them and this is what I mean by
perception goes two ways here where if
you do not present yourself in a way
that is either welcoming or getting
across the vibe you want to get across
this is why how you look going to the
gym wearing clothes that fit you and etc
etc that's going to determine how people
perceive you so when you perceive the
situation to go in and act that you
don't look like a total creep that
doesn't have any control over their
lives you have to be someone they
actually want to talk to so pillar
number three is practice how good you
are at something allows you to perceive
situations better think of skill
acquisition as a way to increase your
level in The Game of Life in a video
game there are skill trees as you play
the game you choose skills to help you
play how you want as you practice those
skills you increase your experience and
new skills become available to you the
key Point here is that you are not able
to access other skills until you
practice the ones available to you you
don't have the awareness of profitable
opportunities because you don't have the
skill to recognize choose and act on
them because if you're entering a social
situation and you don't have the social
skills one you're gonna have to practice
at your level and work your way up but
at the same time when you are more
social and when you have more experience
there and when you've overcame that
initial beginner's hell hump then you're
able to perceive the situation for what
it is because you've experienced that
situation so many times before and you
know how to inject yourself into it in a
confident manner so as you move towards
your goals that relate to confidence
whether it be starting a business just
going to the gym talking to a new person
getting a new friend group it will
require that you educate yourself as you
are pursuing those goals you need to
have information coming in through the
filter of you achieving those goals like
I don't know how to explain it aside
from just pattern recognition in the
brain where if I'm trying to talk to new
people and I'm listening to audiobooks
or anything on social skills then I have
something fresh in my mind to experiment
with and practice with the same goes
with going to the gym and every single
habit you have in your life every single
thing I do that I believe every single
person should do pertaining to their
body and the things that they have
ownership over like going to the gym
starting a business developing a skill
set or mindset and cultivating good
relationships in your life you should
have a rotation of information you
shouldn't even consider reading or
consuming anything that doesn't
contribute to those goals now of course
entertainment is another thing if you
want to go and watch Netflix to uh like
wind down during the night that's
perfectly find what I'm saying is that
like in the morning rather than
distracting yourself and scrolling on
your phone all day you should have
information going into your mind that
you need to have inputs that contribute
to the outputs that you want to do on a
daily basis the reason I'm so far ahead
in many areas of my life is that I never
stop learning about the gym I haven't
reached a point where I know everything
at least once a day I'm listening to 10
20 minute YouTube video on Fitness and
business and mindset and spirituality
and philosophy all mixed not every day
you get what I'm saying there's constant
flow of energy week by week going into
me that I can use to experiment with and
get better results on my goals this
isn't really optional this is the main
thing that I see people failing with is
that they go they pursue something they
achieve a goal they're starting to
maintain it like a nice body but then it
never it just becomes repetitive and
mundane you have nothing new to
experiment with you have no good
dopamine going into your head because
you've stopped learning and so with this
with your current skill what you know
and what you've learned about you have
to play at your level you have to get
results at that specific level until you
can get to the next level and so the
best way that I can illustrate this is
in business as your level increases you
will fill your tool belt with skills
that allow you to view the plane you are
on which is more vast than the lower
level you were at my first successful
Endeavor was freelance web design a
single skill that is available for
anyone to learn lots of competition and
battling for higher prices I knew that
if I wanted to do something more
profitable like funnels for service
businesses I would have to learn skills
like marketing copywriting and buyer's
journey to do that well then when I
pursued the level of a Creator so after
freelance web design and funnels for
service businesses I went into marketing
Consulting and becoming a Creator I
needed to combine what I knew and add
skills like content writing I needed to
add all of the skills that I teach into
a writer the ones that actually get
businesses results because a Creator is
a full stack business if you can build a
Creator business you're going to have to
learn all the skills that transfer over
into helping others build theirs this is
why I recommend building a Creator
business or just a personal brand and
displaying your character in the virtual
reality and contributing to Virtual
humanity is because you can learn web
design graphic design copywriting
content writing branding literally every
skill that makes a business successful
is going to be necessary for you to
understand from a big picture to make
your personal brand successful and once
you actually get results if you don't
already have a product that you want to
create to monetize because you have all
the knowledge to do so you can go and
work for another business as a
freelancer and make 10 times more money
than the person who's just like oh I
want to learn web design as a skill and
Target this person and send a bunch of
cold emails to them you don't have any
experience you're going to lose from the
start because you're not practicing on
building your own business and getting
results so pillar number four is
authenticity authenticity is doing what
you want without interference from
external thoughts opinions and beliefs
that you feel the need to conform to you
one example is that just me cursing
occasionally in videos right where I'll
get a comment that it's like you
shouldn't say that that's unprofessional
that's ungodly and I I don't believe
that at all I've zoomed out I was raised
heavily religious and it was forced on
me hey do not say these words and so
when I questioned it and I researched
and I actually thought for myself I
realized this isn't bad in any remote
sense if people get turned off by one
word because they have so many
connotations attached to it it's just a
word if you get turned off and don't
want to watch please do so leave [ __ ]
leave because I don't care to be
professional I don't care to be offended
by words that every single person
interprets in a different way confidence
through authenticity is a mental game
you must play it daily you must pause
gain perspective perceive the situation
and practice the skill that the
situation requires authenticity is how
you implement the four pillars of
self-confidence so now how do we get to
self-confidence we need a path and I
want to present an unconventional one
the secret to self-confidence is to
become a Fountainhead of value through
education and creation you don't have to
question your worth when you have public
proof entrepreneurship is in your nature
to pursue new challenges never settle
expand your perspective through skill
acquisition and get feedback on if you
are actually contributing to society in
the of money entrepreneurship is
creation and being a Creator is the act
of channeling the Divine through your
human Edge you don't want to get stuck
in a situation where challenge ceases to
exist like a monkey in a cubicle your
psyche will suffer and you will wonder
why your life isn't fulfilling even if
you are a top one percent earner
personal growth is a gateway drug into
business growth and business growth is
the unconventional path to
self-confidence I combine the two in
digital economics so you can improve
yourself productize yourself and earn
from being yourself a natural
progression so why is business growth or
entrepreneurship or being a Creator or
just providing value because that's all
those things are is providing value and
receiving the value that you want in the
form of money how does that develop
self-confidence first is it demands that
you evolve or die most people die at 25
they get their job they get their spouse
they get their house they get their car
they get exactly what Society wants from
them someone who has come docile and of
little threat to their system they are
trying to survive life is ever flowing
ever evolving and if you choose to
obstruct that flow by settling for a
subpar life you're dead death is
symbolic and all understanding is
metaphorical if life is growth and
growth requires new death is the death
of new ideas potentials projects and
practices if you want to survive in a
world that never stops changing
entrepreneurship ensures that you don't
if you persist until success that is
reason number two is that it forces you
to become an expert in your industry if
you have subpar understanding you will
get subpar results understanding is
different from knowledge understanding
is the upward motion of expanding
Consciousness meditation is the downward
motion of expanding Consciousness most
Mystics and spiritual teachers forget
this balance it's not creativity or
productivity it's not monk or Warrior
it's not peace or progress It's not
being or doing it's both its life The
Duality collapses into one if you stack
Theory without practice you will fail in
this business you need both daily
education and execution not one or the
other reason number three is it demands
you get results for yourself and your
customers if you don't get results you
aren't valuable simple as that if you
aren't getting results that isn't a sign
to quit it's a sign to improve True
Value requires development over time
entrepreneurship is how you ensure that
you develop yourself into a valuable
asset in reality reason number four is
that it demands that you suck at what
you're doing so that you can improve it
is foolish to think that you will not
suck at almost everything at the start
this is what keeps most people from
acting on their dreams once you overcome
the first hump you snowball into a
season of pure progress reason number
five is that it demands that you change
your work rest and Play Habits you
cannot reach level 2 with the character
that got you to level one growth
requires change and that's why most
people settle early reason number six is
that if demands a skill set with a
psychology base so you understand your
mind and therefore the minds of other
people because this is all that business
is is you communicating with other
people the value that you have to offer
and them giving you something in return
Marketing sales writing and speaking are
the backbone of business success that
will be in the next video I'm redoing
the million dollar skill Stack video in
today's world wealth is generated
through code and content code is the
back end of the internet content is the
front end combined both and you have
people and a product send people to
product and you have profit you can
learn to code which is incredibly
valuable but unless that is a passion of
yours you're better off learning content
you can build using what the coders
build like website Builders social media
platforms and everything else on the
internet to distribute your content
content requires self-understanding you
must capture attention hold attention
and deliver value to that attention so
business is the unconventional path to
self-confidence and there are so many
different business models so many
different ways of going about this and
so I'd like to go over the one that
worked for me the one that I feel like
applies to a lot of people that just
want to turn their interests into income
and people that don't want to stick to a
status Niche they want to they want to
be the niche they want to display
themselves and earn a living doing what
they enjoy that is more than possible
with the internet nowadays so let's go
over a potential progression for
self-improvers build your mind with
books self-reflection and writing build
your body with the gym long walks and
nutrient dense foods build your business
with skill acquisition problem solving
and self-promotion becoming
multi-dimensionally jacked is the path
to the good life that was an older tweet
of mine I feel like it was pretty
fitting I'm going to make a video on
that as well becoming
multi-dimensionally jacked the anxiety
trap is dangerous when you attempt to
become more confident you get anxious
approaching new people you get anxious
about the change required to build a
business when you feel it pause no
seriously this is going to take a
conscious effort pause zoom out reframe
your mind the cure to anxiety is
curiosity that's it that's the reframe
when you're anxious about starting a
business you're projecting so far into
the future that Clarity is near
impossible your mind cannot bring order
to the chaotic situation you are in
bring your attention back to what you
can do right now get curious about what
you can start learning then learn it
when you are in a social situation stop
imagining every little detail about the
future with that person Focus your
attention on them right in front of you
what is something that catches your eye
ask them about it here's how you can
leverage curiosity more to build
momentum into a profitable business with
self-confidence as a byproduct Step One
is of course as always to start with
writing as you guys know or if you are
new here I'm not a fan of like methods
and tactics I'm a fan of principles
writing speaking marketing and sales are
absolute principles that you will have
to learn no matter which business model
you go into I don't care if you are
super interested in email marketing
that's writing I don't care if you're
super interested in advertising that's
writing I don't care if you're super
interested in YouTube The Script is
writing writing is the most valuable
skill especially when paired with
marketing and sales when you aren't
confident writing is your best bet and
it's the foundation of any and all
content tweets ads videos reels Etc all
start with writing the actual post or
script and it feels weird because I
won't be able to say tweets anymore when
I kind of built my entire business on
Twitter so X if you're up to date I feel
like everyone is but X is the new wave I
have high hopes for it uh I'm still
going to be on there everything still
applies based on what I talk about if
you watch any of my previous videos on
me talking about Twitter it transfers
over to any platform writing allows you
to flex your intelligence while everyone
else competes for looks you don't have
to show your body or even your face for
that matter orange book on X or Twitter
is one of my favorite Anonymous writers
go follow him just look up orange book
it's like at Orange book underscore he's
definitely one of the people that I like
to
emulate when it comes to my voice right
because he also writes very stoic or
that's the way that I think about it
very like pithy very philosophical he
isn't one of the only ones that I
emulate or try to be like but he's one
that has kind of nailed that tone and I
really like that to become a good writer
you will need to understand psychology
to structure a message that captures
holds and spreads attention to
understand psychology study marketing
and sales that's how you learn to apply
your psychological understanding in the
real world if I were to give you a path
here's how to start writing one is
choose a topic you're interested in
making your full-time gig two is to
block out 30 minutes to learn about
Marketing sales or your interests three
is do not skip a day of learning watch
videos podcasts read books and internet
content four is to take notes on the
ideas that stick out to you five is
start on Twitter or X or threads and
start posting your ideas six is to study
social media as a skill so you can grow
I teach all of this into our writer in
the course of three to six months if you
actually try to grow your account you
should gain a decent amount of followers
at least enough to give you the
confidence that you can make it a
full-time business because even if let's
say in three months you gain 500
followers you gain 500 followers if you
could repeat that and improve that then
how do you see yourself failing if you
can gain one follower you can gain a
million you just have to learn how to
replicate that process and make it more
efficient once you have enough readers
you can create a product or service to
monetize your writing the marketing and
sales knowledge will compound at this
moment so step number two is to Branch
into speaking most people don't know
this but the first platform that I
branched out to was not something like
Instagram or LinkedIn it was podcasting
I started I grew on Twitter grew to like
50 000 followers and then at that point
I started a podcast but why it helped me
meet high level people and get offered
more opportunities you don't need video
editing skills it is an easy progression
from writing it forces you to identify
your blind spots and communicating with
other people I didn't use a podcast to
monetize or become famous because one
that's incredibly rare with podcasting
especially since I was just starting out
and I would have had to make the podcast
the main thing that I wanted to be known
for if that was the case but I used it
to get people that I wanted to talk to
and ask questions to on a call and that
made them closer to me as an example I
wanted to talk to Justin Welsh and so we
got on a podcast we talked I uploaded it
to YouTube people loved it and it
actually gave me an angle for my content
that led to me gaining 150 000
subscribers on YouTube in however much
time if I wanted to I could reach out to
higher and higher level people to get
them on the podcast and then I'm
connected with them and they will help
me grow in whatever manner I need the
difference between a 500 follower
account and a 500 000 follower account
isn't necessarily their followers yes
that's a big difference but it's the
connections that they have for that 500
000 follower account they probably met
50 to 100 high level people that you
will never ever ever meet in your real
life you have access access to so many
more opportunities that consumers don't
see because it's behind the scenes
you're talking to people over text you
have such a wide network of people with
diverse skill sets that you can never
fail once you reach a certain point so
step number three after writing growing
an audience and then branching into
speaking nurturing the audience is to
create a product or service because by
now you're growing an audience you have
people well hopefully if you don't you
need to zoom out and realize it's a
skill issue you need a big picture
understanding of social media to get
eyes on good content however you can
money requires people and a product
product can also include Services here
it is what you sell to people you've
attracted this is the only way to make
money you can aim to be one of the
select few that lives off of AD revenue
generated from the social media platform
alone but you will be a slave to the
algorithm creating your own product or
service is how you take control of your
income social media as a skill becomes a
faucet that you can turn on whenever you
want to make more money you know how to
attract people and you have a product
that sells there's a lot that goes into
both you will need to improve at both
I've written about this extensively so a
few videos that you can watch is an
overview of the one person business
model so there's the one person business
model and the one-person business model
2.0 the best way to create an offer as a
beginner where I talk about the minimum
viable offer that's found in the best
business model to start in 2023 to make
a million dollars or something like that
it's got me in the thumbnail like
looking like this or something and then
the last one how to create a product so
you have one hundred thousand dollars
trapped in your head or a hundred
thousand dollars in your head I don't
know because the reason building a
product or service helps with confidence
is that you will suck at first this is
the case for literally anything else you
do don't see it as scary just because
business seems foreign to you you get
direct feedback on what can be improved
people can be brutal but most are nice
if you want to actually make money you
need to actually provide value if you
aren't continuing to grow your audio or
money maybe start thinking about how
valuable you really are that is it for
this video my friends thank you for

yourself or turn yourself into a
business and then there's also to our
writer which is how you learn high
impact digital writing so you can really

social media but you can grow on social
media you can just write better you can

the foundation of any other skill and
allows you to learn it easier and of
course there are seven days to genius
