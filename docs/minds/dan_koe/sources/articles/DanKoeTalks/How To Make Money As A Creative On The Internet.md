humans are lazy they
tend to
phase out what they don't like doing
right and this is why the people that
make the most money or see the most
success in the world are creative people
they are not the people that are working
um manual low-skill labor drops and this
has shown across
the entirety of human evolution
as an example when when we got tired of
manually plowing our fields let's say at
a farm the creative person came in and
innovated and they made a tractor and
they expanded their mind to the point
where that
imaginary idea of a tractor
got turned into an actual tractor
through creativity and building and
pulling all of the resources they had at
the time
to create that tractor so over time
things have been getting phased out i
saw a tweet
about last week that
some guy was complaining about one of
those um like automated ordering touch
screen things that you're starting to
see at like mcdonald's
or other fast food chains where you come
in and you like click your order and
it's phasing out cashiers because it
saves
the entire company as a whole
money now a lot of people would see this
as a bad thing but the people that
either believe in themselves or know
that they have a higher potential and
know that they have the possibility of
learning
new skills and increasing their skill
set improving their skill set through
self-education and the endless ocean of
resources online
and just taking a few hours a day to
actually do that
those people
aren't worried maybe they have a bit of
worry at first where it's like oh yeah
this
like the the low skill jobs are kind of
getting phased out i may have to go this
route or the other route but all in all
the lesson in this is to consistently
improve yourself and acquire
high
value skills and become a student of
life in a sense so you open up room for
more creativity in yourself and the
creative solutions you build
open up more opportunity and creativity
for others as an example the creator
economy so the creators visionaries
strategists leaders etc are the ones
that make the most money because they
make the money for themselves they
create their own job in a sense because
they understand human nature and they
understand that all you have to do is
understand how other people perceive
value
educate them a bit and you know
do it
ethically
as many people would advise
but you create a solution that someone
else wants and then they buy it from you
and that's how you make a creative
income and you go on to innovate as an
example creators i've mentioned this
before but sixty percent of the new jobs
or sixty percent
yeah of new jobs haven't been created
yet creators and i'm not talking only
about like content creators i'm talking
about creators as a whole those that
lean into their nature as a creator and
start to piece together thoughts
everyone is a creator everyone has the
potential
for creativity if they expand and
develop themselves and specifically
their mind so there's people like for
example i don't even know what my job
title is i put this out to attract an
audience and start cultivating some
value i do everything i understand what
people want and i give it to them most
of it eighty percent ninety percent i
would even say ninety five percent of
the content i create is free and then
the other five percent which is still a
vast amount
is paid and the people that want access
to that information or those products
services whatever it may be that's how
you make an income you have people you
have value you bridge the gap so a quote
from naval which
we've we've been including quotes from
him in a ton of videos recently because
i've been studying him a lot he's a very
smart dude and i'm starting to piece
together his entire philosophy and it's
very aligned with mine so a tweet from
him if the work doesn't require
creativity delegate it automate it or
leave it so what this means is that
you need to take personal responsibility
for your future and increase your own
skill set so you don't get phased out by
what is human nature in continuously
creating a better future for us
consciousness is the fabric of reality
everything that you are conscious of
right now you are projecting meaning
onto to create your own reality the
ability to order consciousness is the
greatest skill of the 21st century now
what i mean by that is the ability to
create
certainty from uncertainty or create
signal from noise or
meaning from struggle or all of those
things right it's polar thinking it's
polarity it's two sides of the same coin
there's chaos and there's clarity
there's you put someone in an
environment where it seems chaotic to
them you throw them off their routine
you
uh just put them into a new mental or
physical environment in general and
they'll feel a bit lost they don't it's
not familiar to them
and you put another person who
understands that environment and can
control consciousness within
that
environment they are much more at peace
because they have made sense of that
specifically nature is creative you are
creative god is creative the universe is
creative whatever form or interpretation
of the higher intelligence that exists
out there is creative you can see this
in everyday life
things are constantly creating and
growing internally which is an important
buzzword that we'll get back to they
grow internally they generate their own
energy creation is the process of
molding controlling and ordering
consciousness and this is tapped into
from our subconscious the information
that we have been made aware of
throughout our entire lives the
information that we have been exposed to
the energetic frequencies if you will
that we have tapped into and pulled
information from
that is what we can pull from and at
that point it's our job to take that
make that creation with our mind and put
it out into the world so other people
can benefit from it now we understand
and make sense of this information
through our senses the things that
we can make sense of and that we are
directly conscious of through our senses
now what most people are unaware of is
the sixth sense which is awareness this
is the foundation of creativity because
we can become aware of so many things
that stem
beyond what we can make sense of via the
traditional five senses right you can
become aware of a feeling or a thought
or something that is intangible that
people that operate from the materialist
paradigm don't value
and that is also stored in your
subconscious and allows you to pull from
more information
to
be creative now i want to make a
separation between what people think is
creativity and what creativity actually
is what people think creativity is is
usually dependent on a skill like design
or art or something that implies more
creativity than a technical skill and
while that does
require some form of creative output
that is not true creativity there are
designers that are still in a low skill
labor job making x amount of money
and there is ai and other things that
are coming in to
pretty much take over their jobs and so
the visionaries the strategists the
leaders the innovators the creators of
the world that end up making the most
money aren't necessarily reliant on
these creative skill sets they are
reliant on their nature as a creative
being so the true form of creativity
is
best explained with this graphic that i
have created and am throwing up right
now so at the top it says creativity
equals create plus clarity now creative
solutions to modern problems are how you
make the big bucks that's how these
innovators visionaries whatever
actually make the big bucks they do it
by
diving into the unknown kind of
collecting these dots that you see in
the graph and becoming aware of those
certain dots and then connecting them
now i want you to think of this graphic
the circle in the graphic if you have
already forgot it here it is again
the circle in the graphic is the unknown
or it is the experience you gain over
time or it is what you are made
conscious of i want you to think of it
like a map your job as a human being is
to trek into the unknown
aspects of life the uncomfortable
aspects of life the unpredictable
aspects of life and gain awareness of
what is on that map right and as you
create this map or you
kind of explore this map of your reality
you start
filling in those dots that are not
filled in with
the dots that are filled in now the dots
that are filled in are what you are made
conscious of and now creativity is
taking that experience and all of the
stimuli and information and everything
else that has been stored in your
subconscious and creating clarity from
that that's what creativity is where you
are pulling from your prior experiences
and the information that you have in
your head which is more than you are
directly conscious of right now because
it is in your subconscious
that
connecting those dots is how you make a
creative solution to a modern problem
now i want you to think of it like this
where if you were to put five creative
people at the bottom of the mountain and
you asked them how do you get to the top
right the desired outcome
and they'll all draw different ways of
getting up there because they have been
exposed to certain tools or strategies
or tactics or ways of doing things that
will make all of those
paths that they draw unique and this is
why there is no saturation or
competition in creative markets or free
markets and so that's what people want
they want a step-by-step kind of
systemized or at least clear way of
reaching achieving a certain desired
outcome in their life right you think of
that as the top point of the map and
people have to trek through it that is
your job on this earth is to help people
advance in stages of development by
giving them a creative solution to do so
and helping them navigate the rocks and
the the
roadblocks that you encountered on the
way up to the top of the mountain right
because you're creating a map you're
encountering these difficult aspects of
life you're experiencing these problems
you're solving them you're figuring it
out and you're continuing moving towards
your vision for the future or whatever
it may be your goals
and if you're documenting this or at
least becoming aware of these things
along the way because you can do this
unconsciously and
not be able to tap into
the kind of creative energy that you've
built over time now it's no wonder
why these creative abilities are
harnessed by
so few because by the from the time we
are born to the time we turn 18 or go
through the school system our reality
has been externally created we've been
assigned specific things to read and
become conscious of right because there
are fun schooling i i sound like i'm
attacking the school system when it's
it's a blessing and a curse where there
are fundamental aspects of reality to
get everyone on the same page so we can
actually operate as a society that we
need to be informed or made aware of
through the school system and through
assigned work
it's it's almost impossible it is
impossible to avoid external
conditioning or
just being made aware of things from
other people as you are growing up
that's how you
like learn to survive and operate in the
world it's all survival where you're
imitating everyone around you or you're
soaking in information and you're kind
of building out these complex systems
within your mind
of what's good what's bad when you get
negative feedback on something when you
burn when a kid touches a candle he's
made conscious of oh
this hurts i'm not going to do that
again i'm going to do this instead
that's that's a system right you get
negative feedback so you try something
else until it works and eventually that
gets conditioned over time into your
head
but there are dangers that come along
with that because it is very easy
especially in this modern world
to
just go about life unconsciously to be
constantly distracted to do the things
that are assigned to you to follow the
ordered consciousness or the hierarchy
of goals that corporations and
organizations and religion have set out
for you because that's the thing we
talked about ordering consciousness
previously and
we're kind of in
a
we're kind of back in fifth century bc
when there was an abundance of ideas and
information that was being created
because in this
phase that we're in in whatever this is
just in the life that we live right now
people are questioning things right
there is an abundance of information and
ideas and uncertainty and anxiety are
all there because people are losing
trust in what originally would order
consciousness and create that clarity
for us which are
let's say corporate culture right they
have that uh they have steps they have
clarity on what you need to do
what you need to show up and work on
what you're working towards as a
corporation the same thing with religion
whether you're religious or not they are
assigning a set of values and beliefs to
you that help you make sense of reality
and order your consciousness so you can
operate from a non-anxious or chaotic
place so for some this is scary
right because it's like oh what do i do
i have no one to tell me what to do when
you need to cultivate that value of
personal responsibility in your life
create your own vision for your future
create your own set of values create
your own routines to operate by create a
code for your life that helps that is
conducive to optimal outcomes in your
life that help you navigate reality and
dive into the unknown aspects and
increase your skill set and do all of
these different things that will breed
creativity and a good life for yourself
in short it's about not
accepting handouts or
putting your fate or your future
in another person's hands now this
shouldn't be controversial and i'm sure
it isn't for people that are watching
this video but it blows my mind to see
that taking responsibility for your
future and being able to use the
vast amount of information that is being
put online anything you want you can
find any skill you want to learn you can
learn it anything anything if you
if you have a problem in your life there
is something that you can learn and
educate yourself on and become directly
conscious of until you can test a system
for getting that desired outcome you are
quite literally creating a better life
for yourself by learning self-educating
becoming directly conscious of things
that you can use to solve problems in
your life right
mental mindset it's all about
self-development not only
uh
like the tangible aspects of life but
the mental aspect of life
mindset and mental development and
intellectual development has to be a top
priority of yours you have to
consistently be learning if you want to
bust through these new
if you want to bust through certain
stages of development in your life and
be able to
build creative solutions for those under
you and help them reach the stage that
you've reached in life that's what life
is all about that's what evolution is
all about that's what raising the
collective human consciousness and what
everyone is put here to do is all about
is to develop yourself
and become conscious of the things the
roadblocks the failures the lessons
everything else so other people can
reach that stage faster and you continue
building building building building
because that's the thing in terms of the
job market
60 percent of new jobs have not been
created yet creators are creating their
own jobs i don't even know what i do for
work what would i label myself maybe
like i label myself as a brand advisor
right now because it's like
nothing that i do falls under
conventional
uh
career paths right it's i forge my own
way i understand how to make money i
understand what is perceived as valuable
i have developed myself to a point where
i can help people reach the levels that
i have and i attract an audience of
people that want to do similar things as
me and share similar values and a
similar vision and similar goals for
their life
and i can help them achieve that via
free or paid content 95 plus percent of
my content is free the five percent that
is paid are these creative solutions for
navigating
life and business in general and so
that's the main distinction there is
that
creativity like a design job isn't
inherently valuable your design skill
isn't inherently valuable if you can
apply that skill to help people
improve and develop themselves to a new
stage in order to reach some desired
outcome in their life then
that's perfectly fine let's say someone
has the problem of
not being able to
design their profile picture or they
want to get a design job and you help
them learn what they need to learn
faster than they would at say a college
degree right and now this is directly
applicable across
a wide
infinite range of interests and skills
and all of these other things that
people
learn through their genuine curiosity
right everyone is different if everyone
from the time that they were 18 learned
how to
harness and use their curiosity or their
intuition or whatever that calling or
that force
in you that
you suppress because you're like oh no
i'm supposed to do this i'm supposed to
go to work and do all this stuff and i'm
tired after work and i don't have time
to read i don't have time to learn i
don't have time to go to the gym i don't
have time to develop myself and open up
new room in the unknown aspects of life
to
expand my mind and be able to be more
creative and tap into a higher way of
living that
normal i guess normal people or average
people or people that
are externally conditioned and
unconscious their entire lives
that's the life that they lead so in
order to reach these new stages and make
more money you can't expect people to
just give it to you you have to dive
into the unknown you have to figure it
out for yourself and you have to be able
to create clarity for those under you
because that's what all of this is it's
corporate it's all people helping those
that are under them in terms of the
developmental stages that's what all of
this is and once you understand that
and can learn about this then
that's when things start to open up for
you now i want to touch on focus a bit
i'm going to throw up another graph
which is the focus matrix and i want you
to think about this for a bit
because a lot of people
i've seen they don't take
spirituality seriously or they don't
take
uh
pretty much another interpretation
of
the phenomenon that psychology is slowly
starting to figure out that science is
slowly starting to understand they don't
take spirituality seriously for that
reason when in essence what spirituality
is saying is that you if you are in an
open or divergent or conscious state of
focus in that bottom right quadrant of
this focus matrix that you are tapping
into your creative billet abilities as a
human because you aren't so hyper
fixated on let's say a negative thought
in your head or just
something in general there is a
separation between productivity and
creativity and the further right you go
on this spectrum of focus the more
creative you are the more you go on the
uh kind of
divergent side of things the more
focused and creative you are the more
narrow your focus is
the less creative you are that's when
you are more productive the more
uh
convergent or open or wide your focus is
the more creative you are because you're
in essence expanding your mind or
tapping into your subconscious and all
of the things that you have been made
conscious of throughout your entire life
and now this is where
creativity truly starts to become a
thing because
that's when you can pull from all of
this information that you've stored over
time now creativity is not inherently
valuable okay you can spend
six figures a lot of money on a degree
in artistic basket weaving or some other
thing like that or
whatever creative thing you want to get
into or artistic thing and even in terms
of like business or anything you want to
learn it's not inherently valuable until
you understand how a select group of
people perceives value a select group of
people are watching this video and even
a more select few are understanding
exactly what i'm saying and that's just
the thing you have to understand this
what is deemed valuable is up to
perception what you see as extremely
valuable in your life based on what
you've been made conscious of throughout
your entire life and what you have been
conditioned to believe is going to be
completely different from the next
person completely different they're
going to see it as a hunk of garbage
when you see it as a diamond right so
along with your creative endeavors right
and you are building your creative
muscle by developing yourself and your
mind now the way you kind of harness
this is by studying human nature human
understanding you know studying the
people that are going to give you their
money
and help you build that creative income
source how else are you going to get
money right you need people you need
people that deem something that you
create
valuable so you need to study things
like psychology spirituality human
nature philosophy storytelling just
human understanding in general how we
make sense of the world possibly
consciousness
all of the things that dictate our
experience and what makes our experience
better because that's what people want
people
may or may not some
may or may not pay
to
make their experience on this earth
worse that's not what people want
people want to make their experience
better they want to feel better they
want to experience a better life they
want to have novel experiences and
become passionate about life itself now
by studying one of these things you're
in essence studying all of them right
marketing for example is just applied
psychology or applied persuasion or
whatever it may be your marketing is a
structured way it is a creative way
to
market something to a human and
understand them and kind of tap into
what makes them perceive your product as
valuable now i truly believe that human
understanding is an iceberg that
everyone should master so if you're
watching this and it's like i don't know
what to learn
i don't know what to dive into the
unknown because that's what all of this
is it's learning and diving into the
unknown the way you do that is by
learning and making yourself directly
conscious of something so then the
things that you learn about and apply to
your own life and internalize can be
tapped into from your subconscious and
formed and molded and ordered to
create clarity for another people person
and help them reach
the place that you have faster and
navigate that path on the map faster
than you did so you can raise the
collective human consciousness and do
what you were put on this earth to do
so in terms of human understanding if
you have no idea what to learn i would
recommend diving into marketing
persuasion and sales it's the easiest
way to not only understand yourself as a
human but to understand others and what
they perceive valuable so you can start
creating things that are valuable and
eventually exchange that value
for money that's how you build a
creative income is by developing
yourself
understanding how people perceive things
as valuable
following online marketing and all these
other things to attract people to your
message
so getting traffic and then creating an
offer that seems valuable to them so
i i don't i really don't want to hear
that like this is completely against the
point when people ask me like okay well
how do i start learning about that type
human understanding or type marketing or
sales or persuasion into your search bar
and if we refer back to the graph
on
what we did earlier where it has all of
those dots on it the first dot is you
diving into the unknown it's not about
asking me questions on what to research
it's about figuring it out for yourself
buy a book on marketing buy a book on
persuasion you don't need the perfect
top rated recommended by everyone book
you need to expose yourself to the
information
see what you are curious about as you
are reading through that and then
continue diving down the rabbit hole and
either buying books or researching
online or buying courses or investing in
yourself as a whole and you're learning
in your education that's how you do it
you just start do not ask questions
right now go buy a marketing book do
some research that's
how you make it in this world stop
relying on me to externally condition
you so i may not tell you exactly what
to buy in order to start learning when
it comes to
the skill set that will make
anything else monetizable so marketing
sales persuasion branding
but i can teach you how to learn in an
effective way right can't teach you what
to learn but i can teach you how to
learn so you can learn faster and the
first step to this is to immerse
yourself
in an environment
conducive to the desired outcome that
you want and now what i mean by that is
buying a book to read this month any
book
don't ask questions buy a book
research
read that book for that month set aside
30 minutes a day the next thing is to
follow people on social media that are
talking about those interests so they're
talking about marketing they're talking
about sales they're talking about
persuasion they're talking about your
other interests as well that what
they're not talking about
is
just a like a cesspool of negativity and
self-deprecation that most people get
sucked into or they're flexing this
lifestyle that nobody actually wants but
you've been conditioned into wanting you
don't want the fancy car you don't want
the mansion you want the experience and
that's related to that because you've
been
made aware of the feelings that stem
from that experience i want to feel good
i want to feel energetic all the time i
want to feel whatever maybe the lust
that comes from these girls in the
mansion parties and the cars i want to
feel that adrenaline that comes from
driving those cars so
don't follow those people that are
flexing the false lifestyles follow the
people that are truly putting out good
information and this takes time but you
go to someone let's say on twitter or on
youtube and then you go to who they are
following and then you start following
those people and eventually you're
exposed to this content you're expanding
your consciousness and your awareness
and you eventually immerse yourself in
this environment that is constantly
reminding you and educating you and
helping you learn about these different
things so that's the thing you buy a
book you follow people on social media
uh you
read articles on blogs you listen to
podcasts that your entire
point of existence for this whole month
is to just immerse yourself and gain a
deep understanding of marketing sales
persuasion branding and just human
understanding in general so if you want
to follow people about spirituality and
other things you have to attack
spirituality and
possibly philosophy
from
the angle of understanding yourself and
what you deem valuable so you can
understand what other people deem
valuable and eventually
create a solution to one of their
problems and so another thing you're
doing here is you're expanding your
awareness right so you're becoming aware
of things you're making the the dots on
the map that weren't filled in you're
making them filled in and so eventually
things won't make sense at first you're
like what what is this guy talking about
with this whole marketing strategy stuff
i don't get it but eventually you become
aware of all of the things that connect
the dots for you so you're in essence
already creating solutions to your own
problems how do i monetize something
okay immerse myself in the environment
of marketing sales branding persuasion
and then things start to come together
you start to connect the dots and
eventually you have a path to the
solution and now you can test that
system or that process or that path and
once it works and gets results for you
and you've experienced it then you can
take that and
give it to other people that's your
creative solution for solving your own
problems and figuring it out for
yourself and gaining specific knowledge
by pursuing your genuine curiosity
with this stuff so with all of this
during this time you're also starting a
personal project with potential
profitability right so in our case it
would be a business and i don't want to
hear that you don't want to start a
business or become an entrepreneur
because it's in your nature
right we weren't meant to be
metaphorical monkeys and cubicles that
are neurobiologically deprived of
what we are wired to do we are wired to
be entrepreneurs entrepreneurs are
creators you are a creator you're just
not putting the content that is in your
head
online we've been moving in this
direction for such a long time where now
everyone has the ability to have a
platform and connect with the specific
community of people that they
vibe with the most and that are
attracted to them and this does take
developing your communication your
writing your persuasive skills to get to
this point so i personally this this
isn't the only path but it's the path i
recommend after trying
so many different things and failing at
them your job is to start a personal
brand right so a youtube channel or a
twitter account i recommend a twitter
account because it doesn't require you
to have any editing or visual knowledge
it only requires that you know how to
type on a keyboard now what you're doing
with this is you're kind of creating an
outline and you're creating something
that you can tie your learnings to so
you can apply them right because if
you're just learning and not doing
anything with it you're not learning you
really aren't you're not gaining
practical experience that can help other
people because you don't know if it gets
results so the reason for you starting
let's say a personal brand is so when
you are learning about say marketing and
you learn this strategy or you learn
this tactic or tip you apply it to your
personal brand
because a personal brand
it requires
all of every skill that an online
business requires it requires marketing
it re requires communication it requires
writing and refining that writing and
iterating over time it requires
understanding other humans and what they
deem valuable so they engage with your
posts spread your message and you start
to build a following that eventually
when it comes time to create some form
of solution from your experience you can
package that up and sell it to them now
step number three number one was immerse
yourself
in a conducive environment conducive
learning environment the second one is
outlining a personal project with
potential profitability which
is
in the best way to do that is a personal
brand because you can do anything with
that a personal brand is you just online
and number three is embracing the
unpredictable path
because nothing worth having is
predictable now we're going over this
tweet from naval yet again
specific knowledge is knowledge that you
cannot be trained for if society can
train you it can train someone else and
replace you specific knowledge is found
by pursuing your genuine curiosity and
passion rather than whatever is hot
right now so you create clarity you
order consciousness by diving into the
unknown aspects of life
figuring things out becoming aware of
things and having these dots on the map
where you can connect them that specific
knowledge is how you get from point a to
point b
with the experience that you have in a
creative way and the way you actualize
this is by becoming a creator another
quote from naval that helps illustrate
this point but i'm not going to throw it
up on the screen is that there are seven
billion people on this earth one day i
hope there will be seven billion
businesses i want you to stop thinking
of it as a business but rather you
amplifying your voice and your value and
just getting online and improving
yourself and helping other people that's
what life is all about and that's why
unconsciously i think that us as a
society have flocked to these social
media platforms and why these social
media platforms have been built is so we
can connect
with the group of people
and our tribe metaphorical tribe like
our ancestors had
in
this time and we help them develop their
skills and we educate each other and
help people raise their consciousness so
i'm a firm believer that starting a
personal brand nowadays is
non-negotiable it's not optional because
while most people are relying on
different ways of getting jobs this
isn't only for becoming an entrepreneur
or whatever it may be it's for
displaying your value as a human being
so potential employers and other things
can see your public resume and see that
you are actually trying to apply your
knowledge and get results in these
creative domains and whatever your
interests are by talking about them by
enhancing the perception
of your personal brand and whether
people see it as valuable or not and
having social proof that employers can
rely on by building a following and you
getting results for other people just by
helping them and connecting with them
right it's leadership as a whole so i
want to make this
practical for you more than i already
have with other steps about immersing
yourself in an environment learning all
of this other stuff i want to give you a
simple three-point business model that
you can focus on now this business model
is writing based so you don't need much
right what you need is a newsletter
you need a twitter account
and you need something to talk about so
what you need is a newsletter
a twitter account and a creative
solution or potential solution to
iterate on so the first thing is
starting a newsletter why because most
traffic generating platforms like
twitter uh instagram or these other
short form platforms they're very
shallow right they're algorithm based
and you can gain that algorithm and grow
very fast but there's no depth there's
no authority there's nothing there that
will inherently make people buy from you
and trust you now of course you can sell
from social media that's more than a
thing and a lot of people make a lot of
money with that but i'm trying to set
you up for success not only in the
domain of making money but in the domain
of developing yourself and writing
longer form content so you can make
sense of your ideas more right that's
why i create these long videos is so i
can expand my mind right i enjoy
creating these videos because it forces
me to take what i'm learning and package
it up in a way that hopefully
makes sense to you so the newsletter is
the foundation of these videos so
what you do is you create a newsletter
you write about a topic every week or
every month or whatever it may be you
start a newsletter
that's where you plug your services or
your products now the next thing is
starting a twitter account and
understanding and learning and
self-educating on how to make that work
right the first thing you do when you
start learning is one you create a
project you don't just start learning
you create a project so you can apply
the information to it so you start a
twitter account and you start educating
yourself okay what's going to make these
tweets get more engagement it's
copywriting it's persuasive writing it's
understanding uh social media in general
and the platform you are on
so you can buy a twitter course or you
can just study and emulate other people
but you also have to learn the
principles of social media growth right
when you start playing a game it isn't
fun until you learn the rules and you
stick it out for a bit until it truly
becomes a game to you and you can play
it you have to learn the principles or
the fundamentals of any given skill or
interest first so then you kind of open
up you reach the initial branches right
let's say branches of awareness where
it's like okay i've learned the
principles and that opens up an entirely
like a few new branches to go off of
and it shows you what to learn next
that's how you pursue your genuine
curiosity is by learning the principles
and fundamentals and trying a bunch of
different things and seeing what you
want to dive deeper into and not
suppressing that curiosity now as you're
improving and developing your skill set
here and hopefully building an audience
along the way you can start to charge
for stuff people like people have a bad
relationship with money and a scarcity
mindset around money but if you're
giving out free information on your
twitter and your newsletter and you have
a way of helping people whether it be
with the marketable skills you're
learning like branding persuasion
copywriting etc you can help other
people learn those that are one to two
steps behind you and want to reach that
next stage of development or if you have
another interest that you're studying
let's say leadership or communication or
web design or something else that you
can help people with you can either
start
with a minimum viable offer of something
like 500 to a thousand dollars and start
talking to people and pitch them in the
dms now there are a lot of strategies to
do this that i talk about all the time
not just in this video and like this
video is getting long so i'm not going
to go over the like specifics here but
that's what you do you reach out you
connect to people with people
you ask them what their problems are and
you see what you can help that how you
can help that's just the foundation of
value that's how you provide value to
another person is being interested in
the problems they have and then offering
to help them for free at first to see if
you can get results but then eventually
you can create like a pack of four
consulting calls which is pretty much
just mentorship right it's like online
mentorship at school you go to after
school mentoring to get extra help in
online you dm someone you're like hey
i'll sell you four calls for a thousand
bucks and i'll help you do this that and
other and of course as you're learning
marketing and sales you'll understand
how to do this more efficiently and you
can self-educate on how to do this more
more efficiently but it's more more than
possible right and then you start
iterating on that because
from helping other people you are
learning more you are expanding your
awareness more to know what gets results
and then you'll be able to craft this
process that you can replicate over time
and eventually package up and sell to
other people as a more expensive
consulting or freelance offer or
into let's say a digital product or
even if the way of achieving a desired
outcome comes from a physical product
like a planner right i used to sell a
planner
then i can sell a planner and create one
right and all of this information is
online you can find it if you try to
find it and you just dive in and start
actually building these things so the
way you do this is by working your way
up the ladder so you start posting
online
you start hitting roadblocks which is a
problem that not only you are facing but
other people are facing and then you
write about either that problem or
overcoming that problem or what you're
learning about to overcome that problem
and you start to develop some kind of
confidence in
giving that advice or that system or
that
thing that will solve their problem to
them and that's how you attract people
that you can help to an audience you
solve your own problems or someone
else's problems if you already have
expertise in a specific area you talk
about that in an engaging way and then
you eventually package up a system and
sell it to them but you start with free
work first right whether that be just
posting content online or just getting
on a call with someone or even creating
something for someone let's say you want
to create
uh social media banners for people and
charge like 100 bucks per banner you can
create one for someone that you want to
meet and connect with and be like hey i
made this for you man it's yours for
free
and then they'll respond of course
happily
and you guys will connect and now you're
connected you gave someone else value
and now you're connected with this
person who may have a large audience and
who may shout you out or retweet you to
help you grow your audience and get you
more potential work so as you continue
up this ladder from free to paid you can
create a minimum viable offer which is
something like a basic freelance one
skilled freelance service or
like a pack of four consulting calls on
whatever you have been developing your
expertise in and you sell that and then
you eventually get better you eventually
create a better solution you eventually
charge more and then you can go and
productize that creative system or
solution that you built and sell it to
the audience that you've built over time
i truly believe that this is the way
that the world is going in general
because as creators we all follow
creators right i follow and buy from the
people that i follow because they solve
problems in my life and everyone does
that i follow 500 plus people everyone
follows plus or minus 500 people that's
our tribe that's what we're interested
in that's what we enjoy learning about
those are our genuine curiosities and if
everyone were to do that which they
already do
and everyone were to
deliver value
the creativity and evolution of the
world will just work out
in everyone's favor
but not everyone is going to do this
that's the beautiful thing about this is
that if everyone watched this video
you'd there'd still only be one percent
creators 99 consumers it's just
natural
it's nature right there are going to be
some people that don't understand or
even care about this message so the
people listening to this
you're more than happy to join the one
percent at any time that are creators
that's all i gotta say so
dive into the unknown start developing
yourself start developing your mind
start
diving into the unknown and collecting
the dots so you can eventually connect
them and
just enjoy
the the
benefits that come along with living in
accordance with nature and reaping the
psychological benefits and good dopamine
that comes from it it's just a better
way of living it's a deeper satisfaction
that you get from doing this than by
pigging out on like nachos and whatever
the people do watching netflix all
night i'm not saying these things are
inherently bad but when it becomes your
entire unconscious life yeah it's pretty
bad so if you enjoyed this video please
