when I first started my business Journey
it was out of curiosity I was very
observant I observed those that I didn't
want to be like and those that I did
want to be like and that created
contrast that created a polarity it made
me realize that I don't want this I want
this and this is what I'm going to work
towards so that I don't end up like this
because on one side of the coin there
were people that were unfit unhappy in a
consistent cycle of living from paycheck
to paycheck and to me it became very
clear not out of judgment but out of
discernment that that isn't how I want
to live my life and even more so it
seemed that they were unwilling to
change right and I've noticed a lot of
people in my own network are just
friends or people that I'm connected
with where they experience this very
young it's possible to overcome this
limiting belief when you're older but
when you're young you're more of a rebel
you have more of that rebellious Essence
in you and you see someone doing
something and you're like that's stupid
why would I do that and then you
question it and you work away from that
and that could be good or bad but in
contrast to that on the other side of
the coin to people that are living unfit
unhappy unhealthy whatever it may be
there were people that were living the
dream spreading a great message and
educating others and providing value and
just inspiring people to be better to do
better with their lives and to get more
out of life and since I was born
26 years ago I'm 26 now birthday was
just in October so when I was 26 years
old by the time that I was of the age
where I wanted to start learning about
things and start pursuing a better
future for myself I did it on social
media I follow people on YouTube on
Instagram and just other places where I
could pursue my interests and learn and
yes there's always objections here where
it's like yes the people on social media
there's some that are like uh living a
flashy lifestyle there are some that are
just like putting out a message that is
a bit too extreme or they say that
they're happy all the time and so people
think like oh all rich people are
unhappy deep down all of these social
media influencers they're unhappy deep
down they they don't know anything
they're just putting on this facade and
you're like it's everything is a half
truth right you're you're true to an
extent there are some people that way
but to believe that every single person
you see online is that way and that all
of their success is just nothing it's
just a fart in the wind that doesn't
make any sense at all that is completely
that is just the most closed-minded
perspective you could ever adopt for
yourself because why don't you question
that's what curiosity is why are you not
questioning these things and I'm not
talking about the social media
influencers being rich and unhappy I'm
talking about your own limiting beliefs
and reactions to those things like oh
they're all unhappy deep down it's like
what if there are some that aren't
unhappy deep down what if some are
actually extremely happy wouldn't I or
you have to be in their exact shoes to
know 100 for sure wouldn't you have to
have access to their state of mind that
you will never have access to therefore
it's not worth worrying about it's worth
working towards it if that's something
you want and not talking about it and
not talking bad about it and just
throwing other people off a perfectly
good path to take in life so you would
have to pursue that and you would have
to experience that lifestyle to know if
you're going to be perpetually unhappy
because that just doesn't make sense you
can be happy in any phase of life that
you were in that's what spirituality is
all about whether you play the external
game of riches or not you can still be
happy and enlightened in whatever it may
be and so this curious mindset led me to
trying things that I eventually fell in
love with I tried the gym because I was
watching people go to the gym and yes
all of these started out as surface
level shallow Pursuits that's how it
starts out for everyone so I tried the
gym because I wanted to get over a
breakup and I wanted to get jacked and I
fell in love with it and eventually I
attached new why or new purpose behind
it so that it could become a sustainable
and meaningful pursuit in my life and I
tried new skills that people were
promoting and told me would benefit my
life and I fell in love with learning
and I failed a bunch I fell off the path
but I eventually came to the point where
my knowledge my skill set and my
experience that all compounded to the
point of where everything started to
make sense and I was able to navigate
life and business that much more
artfully and so with a vision for my
future and small consistent actions and
failures and everything in between the
entire hero's journey I have built
myself into a lifestyle where I can
research my interests I can write about
them in a creative way and produce a
valuable message that other people get
value from I have full control over how
much I work whether it's zero hours a
day or four hours a day or 20 hours a
day I have full control over that and I
can increase or decrease accordingly and
yes my income can sway sometimes with
that but I have control over it and then
I also have full control over where I
can live
um and the different things that would
normally keep someone chained to a
specific location and I get to build
products and services that will not only
help me but will help other people and
now the the main downside of this
lifestyle is that you are in full
control so however you perceive that and
the uncertainty and discomfort and
everything else on the negative side of
the coin not comfort and security which
are usually just Illusions and are far
more risky uncomfortable and uncertain
than just pursuing things for yourself
and embracing the uncertain nature of
life because that's what it is but
that's the main downside is that you
have to manage and take every aspect of
your life into your own control and so
that's the first lesson out of the 11
more that I want to give you that I've
learned these are just the most
important lessons that I've learned from
building a one-person business from
doing what I want with my life from
talking about my interest and turning
myself into the bit into a business
which has been the theme for the last
two videos right the first one is the
one person business model how to
productize yourself the next one is the
rise of the value Creator a career path
for polymass and self-improver so if you
want a broader explanation of the type
of business model like the Creator
business model uh or the digital
business model that I'm talking about
here then I would go and watch those but
these are the 11 lessons that have just
these are what changed everything for me
so I hope they can do the same for you
so the first lesson is that it's all
traffic and offers because business is a
game of creating a good product or
service and putting it in front of the
right people if you don't have people to
view your product or service you don't
have traffic you don't have social media
shares you're not growing you don't have
an audience you don't pay for ads
whatever it may be you don't have media
that brings people to your product or
service the way you monetize then
nobody's going to buy it but if you have
a bunch of traffic let's say you build
like a theme page on Instagram and have
a million followers but none of them are
interested you don't really have a way
of monetization
um you don't know what you're doing in
terms of marketing and sales then yeah
you're not going to make money either
and the thing here is is yes there's
details in like marketing promotion
strategy funnels all of those different
things that are tactics for the main
principle of traffic and offers right
there's principles and there's tactics
principles are a must they come first it
doesn't matter if you study all these
marketing funnel and other if you
don't have traffic and a good offer then
you're not going to make money so as an
example and just like a beginner level
thing you have to understand these
principles so well and where you're
going to apply them so social media in
this case to the point of where you
could do this at zero experience and
here's what I mean by that is that you
could affiliate for a product if you
don't know what an affiliate is it is
someone who gets a commission on selling
someone else's product so if I want to
affiliate for let's say a web design
software like WordPress and Elementor
they have an affiliate program then I
get like 30 of what I sell from them
through my link so let's say I start a
Twitter account right here's how I would
make money immediately and let's use it
for the case of a different product
where I have higher margins so a digital
product a course where I could usually
get 50 commission let's say the course
is on web design right so I go on
Twitter I write a thread on the
fundamentals of web design how to create
a good website right I put some time
into the content I make it attention
grabbing I make it very valuable and I
plug my affiliate Link at the end for 50
commission and then what I can do is I
can pay someone 25 to 50 to retweet that
thread right this is what social media
marketers and social media management
agencies do all the time they pay for
other traffic an audience is traffic if
I want to get more eyes on my content on
Instagram I could go and pay for a story
share to get traffic to that offer my
profile would be the offer in this case
and so on Twitter I write that thread
about web design plug my Link at the end
and then I pay let's say
four people so I pay a hundred bucks for
four retweets from people with a hundred
thousand follower audience so I have the
potential of getting in front of four
hundred thousand people then not to not
even taking into account
them retweeting it and then their entire
audience seeing it and many of them
retweeting it as well and spreading it
to their audience and potentially on
that thread I could get let's say a
million impressions right let's say
thirty percent of them make it to the
bottom three hundred thousand make it to
the bottom let's say five percent Click
Five percent of 300 000 is like
I don't know it's it's something okay a
big number and now let's say five
percent of those people convert because
the landing page is good so let's say
that I get like
a thousand people to the landing page
five percent convert I should stop using
five percent because I don't understand
the actual conversion five percent of
one thousand is fifty I think it's fifty
so if 50 people buy a course that is
ninety nine dollars and I get fifty
percent on that so fifty dollars times
fifty is
2500 I believe that's 2500 so from zero
experience from spending a bit of money
I spent a hundred dollars on advertising
and then I made twenty five hundred
dollars so twenty four hundred dollars
profit from doing absolutely nothing but
understanding traffic and offers so
lesson number two is that you need three
levers so let's say that you have a
brand and you have a product so you have
the traffic and you have offers you need
three levers the first one is growth you
have to be growing your brand if you
aren't growing then you're going to get
stuck in the rat race that everyone else
is in of trying to consistently reach
out to clients lamb clients or just sell
via a medium that is not your own
traffic source so you need to
continuously grow your brand and your
follower count you do that by writing
basic and beginner level content that
works right it's not like you just go
and you write something that you think
is basic the idea has to be validated by
the market if you aren't in the social
media game already you don't understand
this where you're going to have posts
that perform better than others posts
some may get 10 likes some may get a
thousand the ones that get a thousand
you take that message and you start
writing about that more so your
engagement increases over time and then
you have a consistent cycle of that
Evergreen content in your creative
process or just how much you post
content and that's how you continuously
grow then you can sprinkle in other
things here and there as well the second
lever that you need is a nurture lever
because here's the thing and what a lot
of people Miss it's like oh I have to
sell and make money online product if I
want to make money with a course oh I
can't sell something that I'm interested
in if I want to make money doing what I
want to do and that's just completely
false it's because usually those people
saying that are in the survival mindset
of I need to make money immediately and
so they start studying direct response
marketing which is a great skill to have
but it teaches you how to get someone to
click and buy in one go it's not like
General marketing and so with people
that are in a less Niche area or a less
profitable area you need to dedicate
yourself to educating your audience to
the point of becoming customers you
don't just attract people that are at
the highest levels of awareness and
marketing and then just hope that
everyone buys no you're going to attract
beginners intermediates Advanced people
you're going to attract a global range
of people and you need to filter them
into your newsletter so that isn't
affected by the algorithm and you can
talk about whatever you want and then
you educate people on your interests and
why they're important and how it can
impact their lives and then you plug
your product or service in order to help
them and that's where you're going to
make the most money so the third lever
is the monetization lever and that is
just an offer or promotions you have to
be consistently promoting yourself you
can't just promote yourself once or
write a thread and send people to it and
make twenty four hundred dollars like we
talked about earlier you have to be on a
systemizing inconsistent promotion
schedule right this is why I personally
made the two hour writer is to give you
my promotion schedule for all of these
things and how I create content and how
I write and how I do everything that I'm
talking about here if I do not promote
my products once a week at the end of my
newsletter which is long enough where
that promotion once a week isn't too
much right it's the perfect amount and
I'm delivering more value than I am
promoting right so people have the
option to buy my products and services
and if I do not get that in front of
people's faces every day every week
every month then I'm not going to make
money and so when I say systemized I
mean you work it into your content
creation process if I write three tweets
a day and I want to plug my service or
my product under one of them then I can
do that and so that means every single
day I have to go in and I have to plug
my product or service so that I can earn
an income for myself and hopefully that
product or service is good and valuable
in your are iterating on it and you are
making it better according to the
feedback that you get from customers so
lesson number three is one of my
favorites and that's to question
everything I truly think that it's just
unfortunate that the advice of question
everything has been talked about so much
that the message behind it is deluded or
people don't take it as seriously as
they should just because they've been
exposed to that so many different times
it's not novel anymore it's not going to
catch your attention and make you think
oh wow that's so insightful when this is
probably the best skill you can ever
perform in life is just questioning
everything especially in business
because everyone's giving out all this
advice that people take as a law and
then they don't see results and then
they call it a scam so questioning is
the driver of My Success in business
people would yell at me like oh you have
to Niche down and who said who said I
had to Niche down aside from you guys
who have built this thing mental
construction of the exact way to get
business success to the point where no
you you absolutely have to pick a niche
and while I am technically niched down
it's a in a completely different way
than what most people talk about because
business is getting different every
single day and I've adapted to that and
I understand that niching down
in the traditional sense as a broad
coverall term is not the answer because
that just Sparks so much like it Sparks
so much confusion Niche down on what
brand content uh product everything that
I talk about my bio if my bio is too
Niche that nobody will follow me or at
least enough people to fuel like I don't
have the growth lever down so I can't
even monetize then it doesn't make sense
to Niche down so this is a side tangent
and for another time my favorite thing
is Broad net or broad catch specific
sale go based around all of your
interests and talk about things in an
interesting way on social media top of
funnel beginner lower level of awareness
and then funnel them into a specific
product which targets a specific problem
that you educate people towards and get
people to the point of having that
better problem in their life that you
can come in and solve so another thing
is like you have to wait to monetize
until you hit 10 000 followers that's a
common piece of advice in the business
realm it's just like who said who said I
just gave you guys away to monetize
immediately at the start of the video
and then another thing is like you can't
make one million dollars while working
two to four hours a day again who the
 said just because you can't do it
doesn't mean that I can't build
something that allows me to do that so
 your limiting beliefs right off get
them out of your head it's hard to
practice but stay mindful
and
question every single thing you've been
told especially the things that are
preventing you from making progress
lesson number four is to deconstruct
everything deconstructing
complex topics or just deconstructing
everything is the key to creativity
right you want to deconstruct a hole
into its parts and then you want to take
those parts and turn it into something
new not even necessarily new But A A New
Perspective of viewing things or just a
new solution or a new way of thinking
about things and that's the key to it
right it's Consciousness and creativity
if you want more on this go watch the
video uh it's like how to make a
creative income for yourself I believe
I'll link it but that's the main thing
is you have to expose yourself to more
experience you need to have accurate
perception in the the things that you
are consuming the information you're
consuming you need to question it in
order to break it down and understand it
and gain a holistic perspective of that
specific thing then from that you could
piece things together and apply it to a
different goal either the goal that you
are pursuing in Life or the goal that
your readers or audience are pursuing in
life right if I'm studying spirituality
and it's talking from the perspective
active of here's how you become
enlightened how am I going to take those
same principles that I deconstructed
from studying spirituality and apply
them to business how am I going to help
people achieve the goal of making more
money with spirituality that's a
challenge that's a very like weird thing
to do but that's what I'm doing that's
where it becomes fun that's where it
becomes new that's where it becomes
novel that's where you change people's
minds around specific things that's how
you become unique and that's how you
create a niche for yourself is not by
getting super specific it's by studying
your interests and applying it to the
goal that you're trying to help other
people achieve it doesn't matter how
broad or specific those interests are
what matters is the specific and Niche
goal that you're trying to help people
achieve if you want to if people said
you need to Niche down
towards a specific goal that someone is
trying to achieve then I would agree but
even then you see what I'm saying here
you have to think deeply about these
things I could I'm creating a whole
video about this I could create an
entire uh something about this a writing
or newsletter or something but it's like
even then how broad or Niche or specific
is the goal right usually I like broad
goals because if I want to pursue
Financial Freedom and I'm studying the
interests of spirituality philosophy and
business how am I going to apply those
in order to help people get there so
lesson number five is don't quit pivot
because everyone is worried about shiny
object syndrome but if you're still in
pursuit of that same goal but you pivot
along the way it's not like choosing a
different skill is starting over or
quitting altogether it's just pivoting
it's not shiny object syndrome because
what you need to understand is that you
are allowed to start over from a better
place of compounded knowledge right if I
learn web design
and I can only make 500 to a thousand
dollars with that singular skill am I
going to prevent myself from learning
copywriting SEO design or other things
simply because someone else told me that
it's shiny object syndrome if I'm making
my service better or I'm choosing a
slightly different path or a slightly
different like Verge from the path
than someone else
that's not a bad thing that's not
signing object syndrome right someone
can take this path to reset angle and
then you can start taking that path but
then you can pivot and you can take this
way and then you're unique so lesson
number six is to copy your way to
success or steal like an artist and so
many people get this wrong they just
plagiarize and they just take
something and try to act like they
didn't steal it from someone else
because you have to understand that
success is a game of intelligent
imitation do not act like you are not
the product of somebody else or
everything in this world do not act like
since the day you were born that you
were taking what other people told you
what you experienced in this world and
what your teachers told you and
everything else to create who you are
today you are literally a copycat you're
literally a clone of a bunch of
different stimuli information that
created you when you were young you
could be speaking a completely different
language if you were born across the
world like it's you are a Copycat by
Nature that's what you do you see
something you interpret it and you
either get rid of it or you adopt it so
I'm throwing up this graphic from an
earlier video of intelligent imitation
where you pursued your Curiosities and
interests you as a whole in your
perception of the world is a perspective
vessel you read and interpret
information differently from other
people and then what you do is you
package up and you distribute those
learnings or discoveries to other people
from your unique lens in accordance with
the goal that you or your audience is
trying to achieve so the best thing you
can do is
practice writing in your favorite
author's voice use the topic your
favorite account posted as an
inspiration swipe the problems that your
competitor Targets in their landing page
deconstruct Why certain posts go viral
and whether or not it brought in money
look at what everyone is selling meaning
it sells and think about how you can
create your own with your unique
experience or read about an idea that
excites you don't highlight and write it
without looking at the text making your
own by recalling what you learned from
memory and filling in the blanks with
your prior experience so number seven is
that the most profitable Niche is you so
traditional or like salesy or sleazy
branding marketing and sales that's all
coming to an end we've explored that
crevice of reality it's had its time in
the market and now people are catching
on people are much more wary of the
scams and other things that are going
about and the age of authenticity is
Among Us especially for the people that
want to take lead in moving in in that
direction right as I am with the past
two videos on the one person business
model and the rise of the value Creator
so if you want to get ahead of the curve
you need to productize yourself and you
do this by watching the other video on
the one person business model because
that's 40 minutes long and I don't want
to take away from the depth that is
provided there by just glancing over it
here but if you want a little sneak peek
here is a graphic of how you can turn
your brand and all of that stuff into a
cohesive business pause and screenshot
this if you'd like but go watch the
video if you're truly interested in
learning more about that so lesson
number eight is that self-awareness is
key absolutely key so if your creator or
a marketer or just a solopreneur
business owner in general you understand
the importance of marketing and you
probably understand that marketing is
just applied psychology what you may not
understand is that psychology is your
mind you can study it at any time if you
are conscious in a way aware of how your
mind interprets things or that you spend
time practicing being self-aware so if
I'm on social media and I want to write
better content then I need to pay
attention to how my mind interprets
content and how it perceives certain
content as valuable or not so if I'm
scrolling social media right just as I
normally would I stop the scroll okay
why did I stop my scroll right what
caught my attention and how can I use
that to catch others attention and then
I continue reading it why am I
continuing to read this post I want
others to do that on my posts so what
can I pull from this and then I like the
post why did I like the post I want
other people to like my posts so how can
I do that I retweeted it okay why did I
retweet it and how can I get people to
do that for me I clicked on the profile
click follow I went through to their
website I scrolled down I read a longer
article I bought their product
how why question why you do that because
other people are human beings too how
can you tap into your experience and
leverage that to get more people and
build a name for yourself so my tweet
from a bit ago sums it up pretty well if
you want to make money understand why
you spend money and now a lot of people
commented and like DM me about this it's
like what do you mean like what do you
mean it's like exactly that stop and
think become self-aware stop Outsourcing
questions that you can ask yourself so
lesson number nine is start then learn
information is abundant and the biggest
mistake that people make is letting
knowledge outpace execution because yes
you can learn anything but are you
learning anything and so my favorite way
to do this is building projects just
always having a project to build a side
project a hobby project a meaningful
project and treating everything as a
project because a project implies that
you are researching in order to add to
that project
if this video were a project then what
would I do I would outline the project
right I would create somewhere where I
can actually flesh it out so in notion I
do this I go or in notes or whatever it
may be and I outline okay this is a
potential title for the video this is a
potential introduction this is a
potential body this is a potential
conclusion here's a little bit of what I
want to write about but now I have to go
and research this thing so I can create
a credible argument around this I need
to pull quotes from books I need to
watch YouTube videos I need to do
whatever and now I am intentionally
learning and consuming
so that I can add to that project and
open it in my phone when an idea comes
to mind and write it down right and so
as a beginner you don't have to be
because experience is always a problem
that people struggle with you don't have
to be a content creator from the start
you can be a Content curator right so if
you want to create a it's all about
positioning and perspective when it
comes to this stuff so if you want to
create a write an article or a tweet on
let's say how to start a one-person
business but you haven't started a
one-person business then what you're
going to do is you're going to research
everything involving one-person
businesses you're going to create the
post and you're going to make it very
clear that like you're not saying you're
not giving advice on how you did this
you're giving advice on how other people
did it and how you're going to do it
it's all perspective and positioning so
lesson number 10 is to create your own
career this is a very difficult lesson
and requires quite a bit of experience
to understand because at the start
if if I were to ask you okay how would I
start an online business with zero
dollars you'd probably give me a few of
the traditional examples of freelancing
starting an agency that's really it but
now if you were to ask me what I do like
what I actually do I have no
clue like you ask me in like if in the
elevator if someone asked me like oh
what do you do for work and I just say
I'm a writer like I just blog like I
honestly have no idea I don't know what
to say it's like well I write tweets on
self-improvement and I make videos on
business and spirituality and sometimes
I post on Instagram as well it's like I
could call myself an influencer but I'm
I don't like that word so I'm not going
to call myself that I could call myself
a Creator but that doesn't get the point
across and it's like I've created like
I can't just
take my business model and be like yes
this is a career for everyone like I can
train everyone into this this deserves
to go into a college curriculum so other
people can be trained into it and
eventually replace no it doesn't work
like that you have to create your own
career by following what works by doing
what works but in your own way without
getting in your own way and then you
continue on and you iterate and you
continue and you blow past societal
expectations to the point of where you
have a holistic view of your business or
whatever you're doing but from the
outside nobody knows what you actually
do like people have asked me what do you
actually do oh so you're a YouTuber but
you make a hundred thousand dollars a
month that doesn't make any sense like
and so it's funny it's just fun to see
that people don't understand the whole
picture but that's the thing create your
own career by just sticking it out and
challenging the notion of like if
there's a problem in your life like I
don't like working eight hours a day
then fix it create a solution for create
solutions for all the problems in your
life until you're living the ideal
lifestyle that you want to live and so a
more tangible way of putting this is
that you can create your own niche in a
sense right you can create your own
career to the point where I like
studying broad interests I like getting
the big picture and Distilling those in
the form of content so if I'm studying
spirituality and philosophy and
Neuroscience then I can create a new
category right I can take those and
create an umbrella category that nobody
else knows but me and then I can start
talking around that called Nero
philosophy so let's say it's
neuroscience and philosophy I'm noting
the connections between the two and I
call my Niche or career neural
philosophy or that I'm a Nero
philosopher right and so then that opens
up a bunch of different topics that you
can talk about and that's very Niche and
specific and something that people
haven't heard about before so it's novel
and you're going to attract more people
and you're going to build Authority in
the category that you created so lesson
number 11 is lack of experience is not
an excuse because it's incredible what
kind of mental gymnastics your ego will
go through to convince you what you
can't do we've talked about this already
about having the affiliate link and
paying to get eyes on a thread and
traffic and offers and making twenty
four hundred dollars and whatever it may
be but lack of experience is not an
excuse It's a limiting belief to think
that you don't have enough experience
you don't understand how to position
yourself in the market in a way that is
authentic and true to yourself even when
you have zero experience because if I
tell you to start writing online and the
200 benefits that it creates for your
life and business how does your mind
object it'll be like well I'm not good
at writing oh that stuff's only for
influencers oh I'm just freelancing
before I decide to start building an
audience and all of these are more dumb
and false than they are true because
it's your mind it's your ego the last
one is a bit too silly and it allows us
to create an example of what I'm talking
about here so that last one was I'm just
freelancing before I build an audience
because people feel like they don't have
experience to start building an audience
so they decide to freelance first it's
like do you even hear yourself you're
saying you're going to accept 500 to a
thousand dollars when you have no idea
what you're doing but you're afraid to
talk about things online
from whatever perspective or positioning
you want to from a beginner level like
perspective you're just saying I'm
sharing what I learned it doesn't make
any sense you're going to accept money
rather than just post online and give
out free information and gauge the
viability of that information for free
in the form of an audience and then
build leverage to the point where you
have a lot of traffic built up to the
point where you don't even have to reach
out to people to gain freelancing
clients so here's a little graphic very
simple very streamlined but it's not you
need experience to start it's you gain
experience by starting and so everyone
human beings in general are leaving out
the pieces of the picture that would
lead to them taking action right you're
letting your ego
close your mind off and laser in on one
specific thing and leave out the
holistic picture and creative ways of
thinking about things in order to pursue
your goals full force that's the problem
don't let fear rule you and keep you the
same so that is it for this video my
