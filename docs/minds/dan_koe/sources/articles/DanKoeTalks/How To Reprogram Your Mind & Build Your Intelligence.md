how do I introduce this
my friends the time has finally come
after three years I am holding the first
hardcover copy of my book and I'm so
stoked I am also holding this but that
will be explained at another time
it's finally here if you want to check
out this is limited Keepsake Edition you
can sign up for updates with the link in
the bio the art of focusbox.com we are
writing or we are doing those first
where it's going to be a box and then
after that sells out there's only going
to be 2 000 copies we're going to launch
the paperback and it will sell as a
normal book on Kindle everything and
hopefully audible in the future but with
that exciting news out of the way let's
get into the actual content of today's
video by starting with the best
compliment that you can receive I've
heard this a few times in my life from
specific people that I've met and the
best compliment that you can receive is
I like the way your mind works and when
I was young I always envied those that
were more intelligent and articulate
than me I always wondered how they did
it how did they organize their thoughts
and put it into words that impacted me
through books videos lectures whatever
it may be how did they say what I've
been thinking for years but couldn't
string into words how did they have
these high level conversations like in
podcasts where I'm so young and they're
so old and there's such a huge gap in
knowledge and understanding that I don't
really understand what they're saying in
these podcasts or these lectures or even
these books but I know that it means
something I know that it's deeper or
higher than my current level of
intelligence and I have always wanted to
reach that point the poeticism of Watts
the pithy advice of Seneca the
crypticism of Nietzsche the Elegance of
Peterson there was a gravity to their
words that always stuck in the back of
my head and I truly believe that they
led me to where I am today they
influenced the the want to become
intelligent led to all of the actions or
it influenced all of the actions that I
was taking up until this point and I've
always known that I wanted to do
something creative I never really wanted
to work a job even though I did I didn't
know exactly what it was but I wanted to
do something creative I knew that even
when I had interests in something like
Fitness I didn't really want to post
pictures of my body online even though
like if I could get super fit that would
be a cool thing but it never really
stuck with me I never really wanted to
do that and I also knew that I didn't
want to work a job so I didn't want to
earn from both my body or my time so I
knew that I had to earn with my mind
then this led me down a brutal path of
skill acquisition and business failures
like learning graphic design web design
trying Drop Shipping with e-commerce and
really just taking on any opportunity
that I could learning web development
getting a web development job and all of
these things even though they failed and
I had learned and stacked these skills
and for a brief moment of time I felt
like they didn't have any applicability
or would earn me any form of an income
because if I had to get a job then it's
like oh okay well that sucks my degree
goes out the window most of the time all
the skills that I learned go out of the
window most of the time but what they
did lead to was the ability to solve
creative problems and today I'm grateful
to say that I can earn a living with the
skills that I've learned the interest
that I have writing and I can sustain a
high quality of life by pulling two
levers the inputs and outputs of my mind
so in this letter I want to discuss four
big Ideas the first is your mental body
and how it rules your life two is how
mental bodybuilding is your path to
intelligence three is why mental real
estate is the most valuable resource and
four how to monetize your mind to create
your own source of income mental
Aesthetics is your master key to the
doors of The Good Life so chapter one is
the mental body that's the first thing
we need to understand and what I mean by
the mental body is our self image or our
concept of self or the idea of who we
are our identity all of these are
synonymous whenever you hear them in
spiritual teachings it's like the ego or
the self or when you hear it in
Psychology it's also the ego or identity
when you hear it in self-help it's the
same thing it's personality identity all
of these things coincide it represents
the idea of who we are because our body
changes every seven years all of the
cells
are different they change they die and
they reproduce and our body is
completely different than who we were
seven years ago but our concept of self
is kind of the same so it shows that our
who we are is not the idea in our head
and that that can also change but we
tend to stay static and people stay
comfortable and they allow their
identity to rule their life and so one
example of this is from the book psycho
cybernetics by Maxwell Waltz I haven't
read the whole thing I just read like
the first chapter and got this example
it talks about a phenomenon where
surgery patients undergo like a massive
change in how they view themselves and
their quality of life and what they go
on to do once they have that plastic
surgery or they change their physical
body that then changes the way they view
themselves because someone with let's
say a crooked nose really had all of
these pent-up attachments and it really
skewed how they viewed themselves in
relation to other people or when they
interact with other people it caused
them not to act on certain opportunities
simply because they just thought they
looked weird and so when they got that
fixed it changed their psyche to reflect
that and they went on to be more
confident and because they were more
confident they took on better
opportunities and they became successful
to an extent so this brings up the
concept of conceptual survival what I
mean by that is humans survive on both
the physical plane of existence and the
mental plane of existence yes so if a
bear is charging at you then obviously
you're going to have that stress
response that fight or flight response
to get out of there but we live in a
very comfortable environment but we
still experience these stress responses
every single day even though we are more
comfortable than ever and I would argue
most people are in a life situation
where they're doing pretty well compared
to our ancestors or even someone that's
across the world in a third world
country that doesn't have internet or
something like that even they're happy
because expectations versus reality so
right now I would argue that 95 percent
of the time if not all of the time
actually yes all of the time humans are
surviving on the mental plane of
existence we are surviving the idea that
is our self because even if a bear is
charging at us it's not that we really
care that our physical body is going to
die we care that our personality and the
attachments to that and the people that
we know the people we consider friends
everything that we attach to who we are
is going to die along with us because
our Consciousness will go blank there's
no longer that vessel that is our mind
to carry who we are to help understand
this more conceptual survival one get my
book when it comes out but if you're
subscribed to a specific religion and
somebody says another religion is better
or they question your beliefs how do you
feel how tied are you to that religion
to that ideology something so static
that you can't break free of right if
someone threatens that do you feel
threatened physically the other stress
response do you get angry do you get on
do you get reactive to everything and
the same thing goes for like a diet
Model A lot of Fitness people let's say
they love the keto diet and they adopt
it as a part of who they are because
they got them results after having a
crappy diet and not trying or
experimenting with everything and noting
the principles or truths between them
all and then creating their own path but
they identify with the keto diet and
then some when someone comes in and says
like oh I love to eat carbs how do they
feel do they feel threatened do they
feel like they have to react and be like
Oh no you're you're gonna die because
you're eating so many carbs and so all
in all this stems from a lack of
understanding and awareness but the
thing here is is when they react right
one you're threatened so you feel like
you have to survive so replication
reproduction of who you are is also a
part of survival so when you feel
threatened you feel the need to
reproduce you feel the need to
communicate your ideas into other people
so that they adopt them that's what
you're doing when you have children yeah
you're having a physical child but
you're you're creating who they are
through ideas and information and
talking to them and so when someone
questions My Religion which I don't have
any but if they did then I get
threatened and then I start to say why
mine is so good and why they should join
my religion whether it's almost done
always unconsciously people say they
don't want to try and convert you but
they're doing that every day because
it's a part of their identity and they
have to survive it so the lesson here is
releasing Concepts releasing the
attachments to your identity and letting
them go to develop expand and grow
yourself not to be confused with
inflating your ego you must release the
ideas that prevent you from rising up
like sandbags tied to a hot air balloon
when you feel tension or stress or the
need to reproduce or react you have to
train yourself to pause this is what
mindfulness is when you notice a thought
you become aware of it and that's really
the cure to it is just becoming aware of
it over time and letting that correct
your actions with time you may succumb
to it a few times it's not going to be
perfect the first time around where you
notice that you're in an angry phase and
you're aware that you're seeing your
body like react in real time where
you're angry and you know you're angry
and you're doing things really that's
out of your control but you have the
awareness of it that will fix itself
over time awareness is Curative it's a
medicine so on to chapter two that is
mental bodybuilding I love this concept
um I don't think I'm the one that came
up with it but I love to make this
analogy of regular bodybuilding and
mental bodybuilding when most people
have a sense of self that is the product
of the external world you have the
chance to peel back the layers you can
build a self that is a conscious
personal creation that works less earns
more and enjoys life that's the intro to
one of my chapters in The Art of focus
it goes into all of those but again
check it out links in the description
I'm going to promote this non-stop
this is my life's work okay the highest
paid individuals are the strategists The
Visionaries and the true creatives of
the world they're the people that
understand that they have to earn with
their mind and that they have to have
control over their mind and that they
have to protect their mind the people
that get what they want out of life have
sculpted and crafted and built their
ideal self they bet they built their
mental body so that it can spot perceive
and actually act on opportunities with
the ideas the beliefs and possibly those
being limiting beliefs that you shed and
skills and everything else that you've
acquired through learning and carefully
curating the inputs of your mind because
that's what creates the self is your
conditioning it's the ideas the beliefs
the skills the education the religious
Doctrine literally anything that you can
consume is soaked into your mind
especially as a kid when it's
unconscious and you're just a spot a
sponge absorbing information that
creates who you are all of these
millions of bits of information
culminated over time create who you are
you have much less self-control than you
think because there's so much stuff
going on in your brain firing left and
right that goes into the actions that
you take you at this point in time can
take Millions upon billions of different
choices you can make whatever choice you
want right now but you as an individual
with the conditioning that you have are
only going to you're going to be limited
to a select few because of how you
perceive life so Destiny or just the
default path or where you're going to
end up is drastically influenced by your
identity so you need to build your
mental body because that's also how you
live a mediocre life is by doing what
everyone else tells you to do never
zooming out never questioning your
beliefs never changing who you are it's
by letting your attention get stolen
from you and being distracted all day
scrolling on your phone that's exactly
how you program yourself to do
absolutely nothing with your life so I
like to when we're talking about mental
bodybuilding I like to make the bridge
between
food metabolism or digestion and
information metabolism or digestion
because life is experience and
experience is information if you want to
get spiritual or like metaphysical
everything is in formation right in this
present moment infinite Consciousness
whatever however you want to phrase this
but we're perceiving information right
now it's just people
all over the place our brains are
processing all of the information and
there's some fact or something like that
where it's like your conscious mind can
process 50 bits of information per
second so what you're focusing on the
unconscious mind can process 11 million
bits of information per second and so
these two processes are running both on
what you're consciously focused on which
is very limited and you have to protect
that which influences what gets stored
in the unconscious and changes your
actions and heavily influences
everything you do without you knowing it
your mind dictates your quality of life
because your development dictates how
you process information or how you
process life when you're overwhelmed
with information you feel anxious when
you're underwhelmed with information you
feel bored to maximize the flow of
information think of your mind as a
digestive system of reality if you eat
too much or you don't move enough you
won't metabolize the mental information
and if you eat too little or move too
much then you're digesting it too easily
you're not really utilizing the extra
information or sitting at the edge where
you're in this growth phase right so
talking about bulking and cutting
because in Fitness when you build muscle
you have to be in the environment that
is conducive to building muscle you need
to both lift weights so practicing
skills or building something like a
project or a business and you need to
learn information or eat food so that
you can actually do that right so you
need to use your skills and you need to
learn new skills so you need the habit
of both what I've been saying in
almost every video is that you need to
build and learn in unison because they
work together to build your mental body
and so when you're bulking you
eventually gain a bit of fat you get
overwhelmed right you do too much or you
push too far in business or you learn
too much information that you don't know
what to do with so you need to peel back
you need to cut you need to stop
consuming so much information you you
need to rest more and you need to
produce more you need to build with the
information that you already have so you
can metabolize it and so a key Point
here is that you need a conscious goal
for every part of your life or every
chapter of your life because a goal
provides vision and orders your mind a
goal gives you a lens to not only build
to but like what to perceive and learn
information from if you have the goal of
building a business then one you start
building the business so you're like
lifting emotional weight in a sense
because it's going to be hard and then
in order to fuel that you need to learn
new information so that you have the
skill and understanding to actually do
it this is where people go wrong is they
try to learn information so quick like
oh how do I build a seven figure
business in six months that's not going
to happen because you're not giving
yourself enough time to build the muscle
and there's things like steroids for
business like paid ads and other things
or networking but those come in later
right you have to build your natural
physique for like 10 years and then if
you want to take steroids you can so the
thing that we need to talk about here is
the balance between the known and the
unknown and living at your Edge this is
where meaningful events occur this is
where you feel the best in life when you
aren't too comfortable and you aren't
too uncomfortable you're right in the
middle where skill matches the challenge
of the situation that you're putting
yourself into when the flow of
information is maximized in your life
through the balance of consumption and
creation you will encounter meaningful
events you will feel a deep sense of
excitement for the future fulfillment in
the present and gratitude for the past
these feelings should be seen as an
opportunity to document the important
parts of your life that you can share
with others when you read a good book
that Sparks excitement in you you need
to write it down because if you plan on
giving any form of value it's going to
be the stuff that you find important in
your life my best Tweets are the things
where I read something and I'm like
that's really good I wish I wrote that
and then I rewrite it because now I have
something to write and I share it with
other people and it resonates with the
people that are similar to to me so if
we take the ideology or I don't want it
to be an ideology but that's what it is
just don't adopt it as law is like the
one-person business or turning yourself
into the business where if I attract
people that are like-minded to me and I
create a solution for a problem in my
own life like a planner then I can sell
it to other people because it's helped
me in my life and if I have like-minded
people following me from the information
that I share on the internet through my
character and virtual reality which is a
personal brand on social media then
that's how I make an income pretty
 simple you aren't where you want
to be because you've been where you are
for a bit too long you have to push
yourself into the unknown you have to
set your own conscious self-generated
goals not ones that are assigned to you
by a job school or society and then you
need to pursue those with actual effort
yes it takes effort it's going to be
hard now chapter three let's talk about
mental real estate whether they be
positive or negative the ideas that
occupy the collective mental real estate
will influence the progress we make as a
species the future belongs to those that
can capture and hold attention with
valuable information for the most amount
of time possible another quote from my
book who wrote the code in your head
that is to say who fed you the
information ideas beliefs perspectives
and World Views that create your sense
of self let's consider yourself as an
intellectual construct a house not a
home a psychic body and it's it's a
house that can be occupied by tenants
and these tenants can either nurture and
build the house or destroy the house by
parting inside of it and tearing it down
and leaving it a mess so in comes the
internet in comes social media and
incomes all of these so much information
that we've never really dealt with
before as a species we're allowing all
of these ideas or tenets into our mind
and we aren't paying attention to which
ones are destroying the house and which
ones are making the house better and we
aren't kicking out the ones that are
destroying the house and we aren't
inviting in people that are Bill
building the house so that alone is a
great way to audit your life is one be
conscious of your social media
consumption two use the information in
your head to create and put on paper so
you understand and can get it out and
metabolize the information and see okay
this is this isn't that good I need to
change this about myself or this is good
I like this I'm going to leverage this
and build something worth utilizing by
other people and so another way to do
this audit so to say is by questioning
why why are you doing anything that you
were doing ever in this life why because
if you don't know why you were going to
that class going to that job marrying
that person or doing anything that you
do you did not create yourself sustained
long-term focus is a lost art in a
distracted world and it's wreaking havoc
on our ability to achieve anything
meaningful so how do you use social
media for good first understand that
social media is the devil if you
perceive it that way and social media is
the vessel for your potential if you
perceive it that way how you perceive
opportunities depends on your
self-development you won't see a viral
social media post as inspiration if you
don't identify as a writer or Creator
you won't see a business owner's
complaint as a post as an opportunity
for you to reach out and provide your
skill set and services to help them in
exchange for money you're letting
opportunities pass you by day in and day
out just because you don't identify as
someone who uses social media for work
or for business or for their career you
haven't built your mental Body by
developing a skill set that would allow
you to do that you've developed a skill
set that the schools told you to do so
that you could be trained directly into
a job and another thing that I find
interesting is that some people see like
cliche or like basic advice as cringe
and then they go on to just scroll and
look at memes the entire time and don't
do anything with their life when the
cliche advice and principles that have
stuck around for years and years and
years are some of the most helpful
information that like people are just
writing off so I see social media as
virtual reality to create your potential
there's so much more available to you
and I talk about this in the value
Creator videos there's two of them
because I also see that entrepreneurship
is the only long-term option for logical
thinkers a personal brand is an
extension of your character the self you
continue to develop your goals are what
attract like-minded buyers your problems
when solved are how you help others in
the form of a product or service your
ideas are the posts that occupy the
mental real estate of your followers and
shape their sense of self writing and
speaking your beautiful mind to the
masses through social media is how you
check the boxes of a fulfilling life I
talk about turning yourself into the
business not only in other videos but in
digital economics my master class of
everything you'll ever need to know for
digital economics or online business so
we talked about like conceptual
reproduction or spiritual reproduction
in like previously where we tried to
survive our concept of self and so the
reason that having a child is so
fulfilling is that you're creating a
self you're creating someone that's
going to go on and impact the world
hopefully so if you want to fulfill that
early in your life then you become a
Creator you become a writer you become a
creative you become someone who
contributes to humanity through business
and you use your mind to help other
people and by doing so you change
identities across the globe I would hope
that I could say that I've changed some
of your guys's lives and by doing so a
part of me is inside of you
it's always weird when I talk about this
stuff we're talking about mental plain
of existence guys okay but this is why
writing speaking and building a business
is so rewarding is that you feel that
sense of connection and fulfillment that
comes from impacting lives at scale we
are in a spiritual war those who occupy
the most mental real estate hold the
most power in the modern world think of
James Clear he wrote the book Atomic
habits if James Clear went on Twitter or
X and he wrote the word habits and
posted it he would get thousands of
likes now if anyone else were to do that
they would get very little likes they
would get less engagement than they
normally do and so this brings up a few
lessons one is that the longer you hold
attention the more power your ideas hold
books will always reign supreme podcasts
and long videos come second short
content comes last but all have their
use cases two is that your ideas must
spark positive behavior change if you
change someone's life they will credit
you over and over for your success
meaning your ideas spread without people
consuming your work three when your
ideas change lives you hold attention
longer if someone is forming new habits
James clears ideas will occupy their
mind throughout the day Which shapes
their identity they become a half child
of James clear so something like short
form writing on Twitter is good and
necessary for attracting initial
attention but long-form writing is for
building trust and nurturing the mind
and creating other selves so all I'm
saying here is that power not only in
your business but in just the modern
world in general or as a Creator or as a
writer which I'm going to be talking
more about is just online writing and
becoming a writer because I see it so
powerful but the way to do so is by
holding attention for longer periods of
time through content and you need to
understand that short form and long form
go hand in hand in that if you neglect
one or the other over time I didn't
write a book until three years in right
but over time of you doing this that's
your goal is to hold attention for
longer so let's go over a few action
steps just so this is a bit more
practical this study that which
generates attention psychology media
design writing Marketing sales
persuasion influence and the mind study
yourself your thoughts emotions actions
and follow them to their root what goals
problems and beliefs have others
projected on you that led to those
thoughts emotions and actions this may
sound like a lot but you have your
entire lifetime to focus on this like
the the when you're not doing this
you're distracted that's it because
what's the only other option it's
distracting your mind numbing your mind
doing nothing with your life there's
nothing wrong with rest but there is
something wrong from not balancing it
out with work meaningful work because
the only pain greater than seeing what
you are capable of is not seeing what
you were capable of your education
should and must reflect that the final
chapter is mental monetization we have
understood our mental body we understand
the concept of mental bodybuilding so
how to build a valuable mind and then
mental real estate so how you occupy
other attention with the Beautiful Mind
that you've built and so now that you
have that now you have people attracted
to you now you need to give them
something worth paying money for that's
called business that's how you monetize
your mind because it's 2023 you have the
resources to revamp your education
enhance your skill set and change the
source of income in less time that it
would take to get a college degree but
there's a trap that many people fall
into they attempt to monetize the vain
superficial or rapid they post half
naked pictures online just to lose their
income Source when they have to gain
weight and actually be healthy they
study the algorithm rather than human
nature and hope that AdSense or just
relying on someone else to create your
income for you Works long term they
study the best business models of 2023
instead of understanding just business
as a whole and studying Marketing sales
writing and speaking that way they don't
lose their income when the economy
shifts it is better to realize early
that intelligence is a more sustainable
monetization lever creativity wisdom
development and character can be the
source of your income if you protect
your mind so let's talk about what you
need to study so the three applications
not necessarily skills that we need to
study are social media offer creation
and traffic generation these are how
your skills are going to be learned and
channeled to actually build your own
thing you must build a brand offer and
practice driving traffic between the two
that's how you make money and so when
you learn the skills that we're going to
talk about I talk about them more in
depth in the one million dollar skill
stack videos there's two of those but
when you learn them you filter the
information through what you are
building and what you are applying them
to the application social media offer
creation traffic generation so the first
skills that you need to understand are
just writing speaking marketing and
sales you need to understand how to
create a valuable message through all of
them distribute that message which is
writing or speaking online like I'm
doing right now now and distribute it to
the world that's how you do it you must
start building not learning and when you
encounter a problem study writing
speaking marketing and sales courses and
content a good book to get you started
on this is influenced by Robert cialdini
the second set of skills that you need
to learn are results oriented skills
something more practical something more
modern but these will change with time
just like how AI is becoming more of a
thing right now that's a good skill to
learn it's results oriented but so is
graphic design web design and
development search engine optimization
email marketing social media marketing
agencies any other business or skill
that people tell you to learn or start
but all of these are made effective by
the Evergreen skills writing speaking
marketing and sales because if you learn
one of them by themselves like graphic
design you get primed for replacement
and can usually only only earn an income
from a job if you don't know how to
Market your own business then you're not
going to land clients and if you don't
study it holistically then you're not
going to be able to scale you're going
to be stuck as a freelancer in the
starting during artist phase doing
manual Outreach all day and hoping that
you get referrals so now that you have
these skills to learn and hopefully you
start learning I want to give you guys
some more just practical advice so what
you need to do is you need to write
speak market and sell on social media so
the way you do that is you dissect your
mind for topics and I talk about this a
lot more into a writer if you just want
systems that you can learn and that's
how you learn writing speaking marketing
and sales as well I teach it in there
but to our writer check it out if a mind
is composed of ideas that form thoughts
beliefs and actions it makes sense to
break them into their individual Parts
study them enhance them and reprogram
the way you think so here's how you
dissect your mind for topics to actually
write speak market and sell about what
are your goals write about the benefits
of achieving them what are the problems
standing in the way write about the
emotions involved in overcoming them
what skills do you have to acquire to
reach your goals write about how you are
applying those skills and what you've
learned what are 10 to 20 things you are
genuinely curious about study them and
ensure the big ideas that you feel
compelled to share with someone else but
in your own words what are the topics
and interests you already consume I love
watching reading and just listening to
really any type of content that falls
under self-improvement so that could be
psychology productivity creativity
philosophy metaphysics business anything
so you want to create a topic three with
three broad interests for me I would
argue that most peoples should
umbrella under the one interest of
self-improvement or self-development or
personal development because we're
trying to improve other people's lives
and then you break those down into three
for now not limited to three but let's
say productivity creativity business and
then you use those as a starting point
to start researching buying books
looking at content generating ideas from
like what other people have posted on
YouTube or medium or other places so
then you can start to create that
content too are you beginner
intermediate or Advanced 99 of the
market are beginners and this is often a
struggle point for people of all levels
think about out what you consume and how
you consume it are you on social media
to actually be educated are you looking
there to learn no that's impossible you
wouldn't be just on social media like oh
I want to learn this because I'm
struggling with this so I'm hoping that
it shows up on my feed when you are
searching for something to learn you're
searching you have intent right so when
you're posting on social media you need
to understand that because you need to
understand that most people are posting
beginner level advice and seeing success
doing that because people are on social
media to be entertained or reminded of
the principles that work even if you
think you're learning from the timeline
let's say you go onto YouTube and you
watch a video that pops up about Fitness
is it not just saying the same thing
over and over again about the principles
that you already know but that's helpful
to your life because it shows you that
you're on the right path so you need to
join in on that and not become so high
level with the things that you're
writing on social media so that you
actually resonate with people and grow
and then you save the hive level
information for when people have intent
to either buy from you or search
something else now the very important
thing here is that one you're sticking
this out for life
okay if you're not leave this video
you're not welcome here you're welcome
but uh you're doing this for life I
promise you that you'll make that
realization eventually we need to
iterate on our big Ideas because it's
the nature of life everything is trial
and error the way you do good is you
write write and then you go back after a
month and you see okay this one did
better than most of them I need to lean
into this more okay A year down the road
I have 50 posts that are extremely good
they got way more engagement than any of
my other posts I need to double down on
those two years later you have 500 posts
and now all of those are validated ideas
that let's say I take them from Twitter
to Instagram I know they're going to do
well that's what I did that's how I grew
on Instagram I took my validated ideas
put them on there executed a growth
strategy
and blew up and then after some time
like let's say six months to a year of
doing this you need to create a data
driven product that you then iterate on
let's say every six months it needs to
evolve if you get as you gain more
experience so you need to pay attention
to how your best ideas perform if the
idea performs well it probably means a
product or service will also do well
based on that idea two is how others
products and ideas perform you have to
become an observer over a consumer view
social media content landing pages
funnels products services and promotions
as inspirational Firepower for your own
sell what's already selling but under
your own name and world view three is
what people tell you they want as you
grow your readers will become more vocal
about what they want from you and what
was helpful double down on this four is
the questions people ask you will notice
patterns in the problems people have the
more questions you get the bigger the
problem and the more likely people are
to pay you for help you can really
monetize anything nowadays like
think of something that you'd want to
monetize that you would actually want to
monetize don't play around with me here
like oh I want to sell dog poop now
think of something you actually want to
monetize and then go look it up
someone's already selling it study them
replicate their business model do it
under your name there's a reason you
follow 10 to 20 people talking about the
same thing online you're
following 10 to 20 Fitness influencers
or productivity influencers why can't
you be one of them the reason you aren't
making money is because one you haven't
developed a skill set two you haven't
created the product two you haven't
stuck that product in the flowing water
of money that's already there and so of
course I've talked about a lot of this
on the one person business playlist that
you can find on my profile here on
YouTube but the best route to take in
all of this is to solve your own
problems in life and sell the solution
because everyone has the same goals and
problems they're just viewing them from
different lenses from different
identities so if you attract the people
with the same identity that have a very
similar perception then something you
sell to them will resonate you want
Financial Freedom Health Vitality love
and every benefit of improving your
health wealth and relationships one
person will try budgeting for Financial
Freedom while the other person will try
a side hustle while the other an
e-commerce store while the other social
media brand and what you do to achieve
the goals will be completely different
from someone else so that path is your
product your job is to attract people
like you by talking about your journey
then package up your path to achieving
the goal and sell it this is how you
build a beautiful mind understand your
mental body train that body like you
would in the gym know that modern power
comes from attention or mental real
estate use writing or business as a
vessel for self-understanding and
monetization enjoy the rest of your week
again art of focus is coming soon I'd
say like two months from this video
hopefully but to our writer digital
economics if you weren't want to learn a
high impact writing as a skill or turn
yourself into a business other free
stuff like the power planner seven days
to genius ideas challenge are both down
there aside from that like subscribe all
that other stuff stuff I'll see you in
the next one peace
