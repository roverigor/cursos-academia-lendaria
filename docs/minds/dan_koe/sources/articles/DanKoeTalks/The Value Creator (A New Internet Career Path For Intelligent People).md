employers hire based on your social
media creators hire based on your social
media Brands hire based on your social
media clients hire based on your social
media customers buy based on your social
media social media is a necessity of
Modern Life it is virtual reality it is
a digital Society it is the new economy
without a public resume you close
yourself off to Global opportunities
most people still perceive social media
as just an app on their phone and yet
they spend a much too large portion of
their life on it scrolling away
scrolling away rather than building
their future once you see social media
for what it is a whole new world opens
up to you you can learn skills that
schools can't teach you you can make
friends that are doing bigger things
than your local ones you can make money
that isn't capped by a salary you are in
the middle of the digital Renaissance
take advantage of it so I was reading a
short form summary of the sovereign
individual last week short form it's a
summary app I have a link it's like an
affiliate Link in my description I don't
know if you get a discount from it you
can use it if you want but I I will read
books on there occasionally to get the
big ideas of an actual book before I go
on to listen to it via an audiobook and
then if I like listening to it then I
order it so I can put it on my bookshelf
and never touch it again but the central
argument of this book The sovereign
individual is that Nations will fragment
into millions of city-states and even
individual Estates with Sovereign Nation
status information technology is rapidly
advancing to make resources available to
more people this will change the
structure of society and how we relate
to each other politically and
economically how people make the most
money impacts the evolution of society
Society shapes itself around those jobs
careers or businesses creating a new way
of earning money or making businesses
more profitable will make Society adapt
to increase its wealth this book
predicted what I have been preaching for
the past year it is a conclusion that I
came across through pursuing my own
goals and building my own business and
it is that the future of work is play
that individual tools can grow a
one-person business with the new
technologies available to them and that
this one-person business model can make
one to five million potentially more a
few people have like passed the five
million Mark no this is the challenge
right it's such a new thing the
one-person business model is such a new
thing because technology allows us to
actually scale that business model and
do what we want through automation
technology uh systems and other things
like that and nobody's really pushed the
boundary past five ten million as one
person maybe a small team maybe some
contractors that I still consider that a
one-person business because they're not
employees but most of these one-person
businesses still can maintain 90 to 95
profit margins if not higher sometimes a
bit lower and so Society in my eyes what
I've seen because I've experienced this
and I'm exposed to it and if you haven't
experienced it then you're not going to
be able to pick up on it when you're
actually going about scrolling on social
media or somewhere else is that Society
is changing to reflect this creators the
Creator economy influencers influencer
marketing how prominent they are in
society is because that business model
is so profitable and more people are
pursuing that and opportunities and jobs
are being created in those Realms while
other ones are being automated and
replaced and so the point is is that
everyone is an entrepreneur because they
have value to provide to someone else
some just choose to get paid for it that
social media is the new society and that
personal brands are the people of that
society and to me people see this as a
bad thing or they like tell people not
to do it but I I see all the time and I
wanted the same myself is that all of
these young people when you ask them
what they want to do with their life
they say I want to become a YouTuber or
just someone on social media they want
to do what they love and they see that
YouTube is a path to doing that and
although this may be exaggerated as a
child people feel the natural pull to do
what they enjoy with their life and
there is and will become a way for the
majority of the population to do this
that's what evolution is all about is US
solving the problems that make life bad
for us So eventually we're going to get
to the point where we can do whatever
the [ __ ] we want because we've solved
all the problems and built the
technological solutions in order for us
to do that we're in the middle of this
entire transition and so I'm not saying
that everyone's going to become a
YouTuber but I'm going to be able to say
I'm saying that people are going to be
able to work in this Creator economy
whether they are the sole huge face of
the World creator or not or they're
working for a Creator more free time on
their hands just freelancing for them
and being able to create the autonomy in
their life that they want and so the
Creator economy is composed of brands or
city-states in The Sovereign
individual's prediction and then there's
creators which are the individual
Estates that maintain their own
sovereignty and so if you want to play a
role in this next phase of evolution the
value Creator is the answer for you and
so first we need to talk about the
importance of Education because the
education system is just wrecked
education is the first step in value
creation how are you going to create
something valuable if you don't have the
education on how to do so or you don't
have the skills or you don't have
anything you don't have anything worth
putting into packaging up and
distributing to someone else that is
valuable to them so yes in order to to
join in on this new economy you're going
to have to do something with your life
shocker but the conventional education
won't cut it because the current school
system is just that it's a system a
system has an end goal or desired
outcome it has tenants or variables or a
path for people to do that and a
starting point so the societal system is
go to school get a job right that's the
desired outcome so what is school
pushing you towards it's training you
into a job because the school system is
intimately tied with government politics
and the economy the old economy and so
you aren't going to find any of that
education in there that threatens that
system because systems survive just like
humans do or we how we survive the
concept of ourself a system is a form
within reality that will survive if it
breaks down then the people that compose
that system are going to fight to keep
it together and so if you want to make
it in this new economy then you're going
to have to educate yourself from the
people that created that economy or
created this new system even though it's
a much more system so that means courses
coaching and content from the brands and
creators that created the jobs to begin
with like what blows my mind is like oh
like people don't trust some people
don't trust people that don't have a
degree when it comes to working for them
or doing something in the Creator
economy so to say but it's like the
school system they're not creators they
don't know what it takes to actually
build a business in this new economy and
so they don't have the right to teach
you that even if there's a course or
curriculum around it they haven't done
it so new jobs are being created left
and right and you know you're on the
right track if
a boomer tells you to get a real job
because every great idea started as
blasphemy until it became normal so this
area is still developing but it's
growing day after day if you want to
just prove it to yourself go and look up
a statistic on the projections of online
education or just the projection of the
Creator economy it's absolutely [ __ ]
insane lifelong self-education will be a
requirement to continue adapting to the
digital landscape and being able to
survive within this new economy you're
going to have to educate yourself on the
skills required to make money that's
what I'm saying education shapes the
future because it shapes human behavior
education expands your perspective and
allows you to spot opportunities in
unknown territory the new education
system is being built online before your
eyes set a goal find creators you
resonate with drown yourself in the
information they provide watch new
opportunities register in your awareness
act on them like your life depends on it
so there was a previous value Creator
video about eight to nine months ago
that I made that did really well it
resonated with a lot of people and so
now I'm back here to recreate this video
because I have more things that I can
share with you and there's going to be
some repetition but so it isn't too
repetitive in short value craters are
those that earn with their mind not
their time so they can stay as a
one-person Business Without limiting
their income one man's labor cannot
scale but their creative ability can
they research their obsessions and
distill their learnings with writing
video and other internet content they
get paid for aggregated knowledge and
experience in the form of digital
products or physical products if you
want but everyone should have some form
of digital product they have a heavy
focus on educating Their audience
instead of posting memes starting drama
or other things like that and now I'm
not saying you can't post memes or [ __ ]
posts or whatever you're supposed to
entertain you're supposed to be yourself
but I'm just saying you need different
pillars of your brand you can't just
become a [ __ ] post account and expect to
become someone that's valuable and gets
paid you need to actually help people
get results in their life and that comes
through education and so the value
creators the type of one person business
that I teach if you haven't already
watched the one-person business model
video there's also the one person
business model 2.0 or the one-person
business model series I've talked about
this a law and so in this value Creator
business model it's about creating
social media content and building
distribution beneath your name as a
person and then building an education
product or service that your past self
could have used like a course coaching
or tutor offer or even just a tool like
if I was struggling with productivity in
the past and now I'm very productive I
can create a planner for myself I'm
actually in the process of creating the
power planner 2.0 to include with the
art of focus book launch in the Keepsake
Edition and then when you reach however
much money you want to make like a
hundred thousand dollars a year to three
million to five million a year with time
with a lot of time you can build
whatever else you're passionate about so
I'm not saying oh don't go and start the
company of your dreams or start a
billion dollar company I'm saying build
leverage and actually start making some
form of good money first so that you can
invest into that thing that's is way
higher than your current level and then
you use your personal brand or your
value creation to actually fuel that you
have so much more leverage and you can
do whatever you want I see so many
millionaires I don't know about
billionaires I wanted to say that but I
know so many millionaires that built
businesses and I just saw one the other
day saw heal Bloom he's a good friend of
mine he posted and he's like personal
brands are the ultimate business hack or
something and he talked about how he's
built multiple businesses before and now
when he builds a business he already
knows it's going to be successful
because he has so many people that are
already going to be customers because
you have an audience you know what they
want you create something for them that
is valuable to their lives it's not like
you're just milking your audience for
money by scamming them you're giving
them something valuable you're creating
something for them that they actually
want to pay for or else they wouldn't
pay for it the people that have such a
bad psychological relationship with
money always get this [ __ ] twisted and
so with this why I like the education
model the best is because you just tap
into your own individual experience and
you help people live better lives with
the products that you create and you
actively create an education system
online that new people can join and they
can choose use the creators that they
want to learn and learn best from rather
than all going through the same
education system and turning into cogs
in the machine so now let's go over a
few metaphors that I really like to help
illustrate what a value Creator actually
is or even just what a creative is and
so creators in my eyes are just DJs with
ideas so DJs play music sets they mix
together synths and sounds and they
remix certain things in essence they
pull a bunch of different things and
they turn it into a new thing and
technology has evolved to allow the DJs
specifically electronic music and some
and other people that use it all of them
use it but they can create whatever they
want because they're able to manipulate
the sounds and piece things together so
seamlessly where just physical
instruments wouldn't have been able to
do that in the past and so this created
this sprung up all of these new genres
and different things like you look at
EDM genres electronic dance music this
is why I love it so much is just because
everyone's creating new genres left and
right I I understand the value of like
classical music and how good it can be I
think it's silly to deny the creativity
and evolution of this electronic music
industry and how that you can note that
pattern in every other industry and you
can get on get in on the one that you
want so in the Creator economy with
people growing this education they're
talking about new topics in education
and creating this tree of content for
people to explore we're documenting the
collective Consciousness online so with
software and skill DJs can blend
together sounds into songs and with
software and skill creators can blend
together ideas into content they collect
ideas of their own others and remixes of
their favorites then they weave them
together with the Evergreen skills
writing speaking marketing and sales
with time they attract an audience that
invests their attention in those ideas
with that attention they can benefit
humanity and make an income doing what
they enjoy so one mistake that creators
make here is that people want to hear
the same sound from their favorite
artists over and over again so I like
heavy dubstep so excision is so someone
if you like excision you know what I'm
talking about or just any heavy bass I
like a lot of the lower not lower name
but lesser known people as well you've
experienced this where if one of those
artists would change their sound like
you like the artist because you like
their sound it just hits different for
you and if excision were to go and play
like let's say drum and bass it may be
good but if you were to switch over to
that exclusively or if you were to
switch completely over to country music
then he would lose 90 of his audience
it's like you have a creative boundary
to operate within based on who you are
and so the same thing goes with creators
is that people are people are so afraid
about repeating themselves when
repetition and conditioning is what
actually changes people's lives there's
a reason I create so many one-person
business videos is because it's such a
powerful concept and from one one person
business model video alone from last
year wasn't the best that I could
articulate it and I didn't cover every
single aspect of it then
who the [ __ ] does that help it helps no
one it's just like blue balling people
into oh here's a potential for a
one-person business model go try it out
but no I have to keep repeating and
conditioning the message into your head
in a positive way programming could be
good or bad you can be programmed into a
life that you hate or programmed into a
life that you want and so your job as a
Creator is to find an angle that
resonates with people and milk it for
eternity with your creative ability
because I'm weaving in philosophy
spirituality metaphysics
self-improvement to all of my videos and
I find a way to incorporate business
aspects as well even if the business
isn't even if the video isn't only about
business and so the number one reason
people fail as value creators is that
they're just afraid to put themselves on
the market because they don't think that
they're unique How many pairs of shoes
do you have how many books on the same
topic do you read how many artists in
the same genre do you listen to write
what you would want to read sell a
product you would want to buy make the
videos you would want to watch put your
variation of what people want on the
market because only then does your luck
increase from zero to one percent there
are so many dubstep artists there are so
many artists within a specific genre
that are seeing success so how do we
start our journey as a value Creator and
it is by becoming a mental blacksmith
because blacksmiths in a video game at
least will mine for ore to fuel their
creations and then they will smelt the
ore and turn it into armor or weapons
creators mine a crevice of reality that
they are interested in a specific topic
of course while keeping the holistic
aspect of things in mind like if you're
interested in health then you're
probably also interested in business etc
etc in short you're studying certain
things you're just consuming information
that you're interested in and you're
extracting lessons or ideas from it so
that you can turn it into something new
and so with those ideas we create armor
and weapons to give to our audience and
armor is the perspective or worldview
that helps people navigate reality in a
better way like how a book can change
your life because it brought awareness
to a potential that you had no idea
existed and then weapons are the tools
for battle or the actual advice to how
to teaching people how to actually do
things and encouraging them to do it and
so how do we actually start doing this
first thing we do is we create a lens so
here's a graphic of your perception or
your lens or your perspective and this
you consume information at the bottom
you see so your vision your goals your
problems and you it shapes how you
perceive certain situations and then
from there you extract certain parts of
that information so that you can create
because think about it if you don't have
a goal like if you have a goal in your
mind or a problem or your vision for the
future in your mind like the graphics
showed then if I have a problem of money
in my life and it's actually top of mind
it's there I'm perceiving situations
through it because it's stressful then I
read a book doesn't matter what the [ __ ]
the book is it can be on spirituality it
can be on academic writing it can be on
anything you read it and it's gonna one
of the words one of the sentences
something is going to stick out to you
that resonates with the problem
pertaining to money and then you can
turn that and change how it's viewed or
create something new for your audience
who is trying to make money in a sense I
mean you're reading through their
problems as well so you can help them
solve the problems if you have that top
of mind for them and then you create
something new because someone else is
going to extract a completely different
lesson they're going to make a
completely different highlight in the
book depending on the goal problem or
Vision that they are working towards so
you need to build a project or have a
goal or have a vision for your future
why because leaders attract followers
this is your Niche and brand it is how
you frame everything you read and write
this is how you create something
valuable value helps people overcome
their problems or achieve their goals we
are aiming to attract people with shared
goals your your brand is attracting
people that has a shared goal or Vision
as you that's how you're on the same
page so step number two after creating a
lens is to pursue curiosity and collect
material don't consume research the best
creators don't consume they consume but
they do it from the lens of wanting to
learn and apply not just like entertain
themselves and this perception shift
alone will turn you into an idea gen
generation machine you don't just scroll
the internet and let everything pass you
by and forget about it and laugh a bit
about how funny that Meme was you you
read it with the lens to turn it into
something of your own you're looking for
Creative Firepower so you must fall back
in love with learning outside of the
traditional education system that made
you hate it read books listen to
podcasts read blog posts and newsletters
and immerse yourself in information that
aligns with your goals have a notebook
app or idea development system like
seven days to genius ideas it's free in
the description to keep your ideas safe
no you won't remember them this step is
absolutely critical I'm not exaggerating
do it note down the ideas that raise
dopamine in your brain the ones that
rivet your attention to them the ones
that change your perspective and bring
you Clarity contemplate different angles
of the ideas you jot down and how they
apply to your vision goals and problems
in your life this is what you write
about in your content because the thing
is is even if an idea you're writing
about ideas you're Distributing ideas
you're not writing about topics you're
helping people overcome problems in
their life towards their goals it
doesn't matter if that has to do with
money health whatever if it helped you
understand and brought you Clarity then
share it with your audience if it's
something spiritual and you're so
focused on building a business but it
helped you then it's going to help
someone else build a business this is
why I'm not huge on picking one Niche
and sticking with it and hammering it
out is because you're missing out on so
much more to life and you're missing out
on how you can actually serve your
audience reality is not Niche down you
are not niched down watch my video Niche
down is stupid advice or terrible advice
for smart people so if you want courses
with exact steps and strategies check
out tour a writer or digital economics I
talk about this all in there with
practical steps so step three is that
you want to create armor and weapons as
we talked about we're becoming mental
blacksmiths because the ideas you
collect from your curiosity Pursuit or
your learning will start to shape your
world view and perspective and thus your
identity that's going to shape who you
are because you're going to start
holding that as who you are oh I'm a
writer I'm a value Creator I'm this I'm
not it's going to change how you act in
the world so for armor creation give
people ideas motivation and inspiration
toward their goals this shapes their
perspective and identity they can be
happier in life and achieve their goals
weapon creation is about giving
actionable steps Solutions and advice
writing speaking Marketing sales watch
the one million dollar skill Stack video
or how you Channel your ideas into
impactful Creations if you don't
understand psychology or mechanics or
just Marketing in order to craft a
message that is actually perceived as
valuable to someone else because
marketing I mean marketing is perception
but value is perception so that's what a
value Creator is and now we need to talk
about monetizing the creative ability of
your mind because we are shifting away
from shallow promises and good looks as
a way of building an audience it's less
about oh look at me and more about look
at you here's what you can do and the
health industry the fitness industry
continues to grow unhealthy because
people's income is dependent on their
looks I've I've seen that I've heard
this in many podcasts I'm deep in the
fitness industry in terms of like what I
listen to and what I like doing in my
free time and what I've noticed is that
people that aren't intelligent I'm not
saying they are intelligent I'm saying
that they don't have a way of educating
Their audience they're banking on the
algorithm AdSense and getting paid by
the platform or even their coaching
programs they're banking on their looks
and less about their persuasive ability
in order to make an income and I've
heard this many times is that when
people actually gain weight to get to a
healthy body fat percentage where they
feel better and they aren't shredded all
the time their income decreases by a lot
and so they have to get shredded again
they have to lose body fat and be
unhealthy in the health industry in
order to make money and so the smart
people that educate and write and create
information products on this thing are
the ones that actually make more money
and have a sustainable way of making
money in that Health industry and so
that's just one example because there's
more than that right there's there's
visuals and there's art and there's
other things if you don't back that with
a philosophy or depth or education
around those things you're not
necessarily setting yourself up for
Success this was my problem when I was a
digital artist is that I just wanted to
sell my little little art things and I
didn't provide any education I didn't
teach people how I did it and so before
we go any further we need to handle two
limiting beliefs here that many of you
have the first is that you can build an
audience or readership every single
person on social media follows 300 to a
thousand people even creators I follow
that many people that's more than enough
to make a full-time income if you know
what you're doing because your audience
is not just your audience I've talked
about this so many times before just
start because I I can go over the math I
can talk about Network effect I can talk
about you not needing to sell a digital
product for a hundred dollars you can
sell a service for two thousand dollars
and you don't even need an audience to
do that but you do need to actually be
showing that you know your [ __ ] on your
profile and you can grow if you want to
there's more than enough strategies to
actually grow the second thing is that
the market is not saturated it only
seems saturated because you're following
the 300 to a thousand people that are
all talking about the same things and
you're getting shared posts that those
people resonate with as well you'd have
no [ __ ] clue what's going on on the
complete other side of the internet and
if you were thrown into that area you'd
be lost you'd have no idea what was
going on you'd hate it you're you you're
in your own little social media bubble
of comfort because you feel like it if
you went on threads the new Instagram
app uh the first day you were seeing all
this content that you just weren't used
to and you're like what the [ __ ] is this
is this app good I found some good
people that I like and then eventually
it's now more tailored and so if you
pair this with my way of niching down
which is the most profitable niches you
video Then You're Gold so now we need to
talk about simplifying complex topics as
the greatest skill of the 21st century
because value creators are sense makers
your job is to make sense of your life
the world and bring Clarity to the
actions that others should take the ones
that follow your vision and want to make
it a reality this comes with time and
action you will not know if your
Creations are valuable if you never get
eyes on them if you're not writing
content this is another thing I saw on
threads the Instagram app because it
sounds weird saying threads because
that's a thing on Twitter I see people
like oh it's my time to shine now that
that threads is like new and beginning
it's like yeah you have a bit more
opportunity but you're still at Ground
Zero in terms of your idea and
generation if you would have written 10
000 tweets without any form of growth on
Twitter which wouldn't have happened
then you'd be in a much better spot and
you would grow a lot faster on threats
but no you feel like you have to start
from scratch and get those 10 000
iterations out of the way and make the
same amount of progress that you would
either way whether or not you're
starting on a new platform or not you
don't have the experience of creating
[ __ ] because you must post you need data
you need to refine your ideas over time
and figure out which ones are going to
do the best the only way I was able to
go from Twitter over to Instagram and
actually grow on there is because I had
20 000 tweets and a hundred of those
being the best and I can make a hundred
Instagram posts and all of them pop off
all of them get me the most followers
possible because those are the ones that
brought me the most followers on Twitter
you have to get under every 100 good
posts there's a thousand bad posts and
if you don't put in those reps you're
[ __ ] if you don't get your content in
front of people you won't know if your
ideas are valuable if you get your
content in front of people and it
doesn't do well then it wasn't valuable
you need to write better if you don't
work to get your products in front of
people you won't make money if you get
your products in front of people and no
one buys your product isn't perceived as
valuable you need to sell better do you
understand just think critically about
why you're not making progress it's
obvious because perceive is the key word
here marketing and sales are perception
you need to write speak market and sell
to the identity that you are targeting
which is you you need to write to
yourself in a way that actually
resonates with you because a valley girl
won't resonate with a meathead
bodybuilding advice a soccer mom
probably won't resonate with
philosophical musings on business your
language dictates who you attract okay
so where do we start we start with
writing it clarifies your thoughts it
makes you more articulate it can be
repurposed into any other medium
speaking video or visuals it is also a
seamless non-demanding lever moving task
that you can schedule in the first block
of each morning so we prioritize growth
and content on writing platforms like
the new Instagram threads Twitter email
newsletter Etc and then you just
repurpose those to anything you want to
create a real script script or short
script read one of your tweets you want
to create a YouTube video oh you have
newsletters and blogs in place it's that
simple so but we're going to start with
a newsletter first and foremost because
depth is what separates you on a
superficial Market no you don't need
email subscribers because you can also
upload it to a Blog if it helps just
think about it as writing blog posts
that will grow in traction over time or
you can use it as a way to build out
your lead magnets or products in real
time and no it doesn't matter if you
give those sections of them away for
free because subscribers will come
eventually and you're building such a
so [ __ ] powerful to actually create
the depth that was if you go and look at
my profiles anywhere my brand took off
when I started writing long form and so
if you just keep at it with long form
short form and sending traffic to each
then eventually do very well because
that's what you do next is you come you
condense the complexity into tweets with
a newsletter you're writing out
everything that's on your mind relating
to the topic you're educating people
you're helping people understand that is
the most valuable but now you need to
tap into human psychology and create
some form of short heavy hitting ideas
that attract people that you can lead
into that longer form because people
naturally read shorter form content and
you need to encourage them to see the
value in what you have to offer in the
long form and so Twitter in my eyes was
an underrating writing platform it still
is I used to talk about it in like all
almost every video but now I'm on
threads I like threads a lot actually it
reminds me of Twitter and it's infancy
and it's just really fun to be there
like if you're not on threads yet before
it starts to develop more and you don't
see the raw Community that's there
don't miss out on it it's just fun and
so threads has a lot of potential why
because you can post as much as you'd
like to test your ideas before you post
them on other platforms it's writing
based meaning you don't have to be a 10
out of 10 model living in Thailand
sipping Coconuts on the Beach it is like
a forum where you can find like-minded
people much quicker in the replies of
your favorite accounts the retweet or
repost button is a low friction share
feature that's how you gain followers
other platforms are harder to grow on as
a beginner replies are actually heavily
favored on threads just reply reply
reply and you can just screenshot your
tweets or threads to grow on other
platforms this is how I grew without
spending hours on creating new content
and so the basics of growing on Twitter
and threads are simple post one to three
times a day and start getting your
failures out of the way if you are under
a thousand followers focus on networking
with other people in the replies and DMS
to leverage Their audience have a
clickable profile picture so people know
that you're a Creator use your big goal
in life or the interest you talk about
as your bio what you're leading people
towards and how will they get there
through your unique interests and I
right threads or long posts based on
your story and personal experience but
make sure you have a network to share it
so that it will go semi-viral start with
beginner level educational content make
it actionable because that's what
everyone's doing when they start growing
on a certain platform people start
posting whatever they want and then they
don't grow but when you look at a
YouTuber and you look back at their
history it's usually actionable advice
on the topic that they actually have
expertise in while baking in their
personality or other interests with it
so step number two after writing is just
writing is prioritize ideas and
attention capture because attention is
the currency of the 21st century and
ideas are how you capture attention and
so without getting too complex here I'm
just going to give you a few examples of
how to capture attention I talk about
this in digital economics and to our
writer or you can just read a book like
influence by Robert cialdini so problems
are the first thing every good story
captures attention by starting with a
problem that the reader is facing it
opens a curiosity Loop and makes them
want to find the solution problems are
at the root of human behavior numbers
specific numbers are a pattern interrupt
when you're scrolling on social media
the example is I read 347 self-help
books so you don't have to is an example
statistics similar to numbers statistics
set the scene quite nicely 97 of the
population has seen a decline in Focus
here's how to fix yours it's an example
they can use a bit of work but you see
the power in it so step number three is
to treat yourself as your ideal reader
so when you're building an audience or
you're just selling something it the
common advice is to sell to an ideal
customer or a customer Avatar so with
the one person business that I teach I
say that you are the niche so you're
writing and selling to yourself you are
the customer Avatar and so in digital
economics I have people take the
Myers-Briggs personality test I every
time I recommend something there's
always like some expert in it and I
think it's cool but there's like
personality people where they're like
crazy about their personality tests and
there's 10 times better tests you can
take it's like we're just getting an
idea here we're helping understand
ourselves a tiny bit more just so you
can write better you don't need to do
this at all because when you understand
yourself you can write to yourself but
now what do you write if you're going
through a tough time give yourself
advice and write it online in your
public Journal give your past self
advice on overcoming the problems you
faced but faster give your future self
encouragement to achieve the goals you
are trying to achieve these are just a
few of the many ways to actually start
creating content so step number four
that I always talk about is to turn your
personal projects into products because
in anywhere that you're making progress
in life right so if you are a health
personal brand and you're making
progress in health and you're
documenting the journey and you're
making progress then you can that's
technically a project that you can
package up and sell to someone else if
you've grown an audience or you've
gotten better at writing or you've
gotten better at marketing or whatever
skill it is or interest that you're
interested in spirituality whatever this
is how you start becoming an actual
expert is by selling something getting
feedback on it and making it better
because in my eyes yes I don't think
that scams or certain products should be
on the market but at the same time you
have to realize like how else is the
industry going to evolve like the the
Bad actors or the people that are
actually scamming people yes they need
to be eradicated off the face of the
earth I completely agree with you but
bad products in general yes they need
feedback yes they need to be called out
every now and then but there's going to
be bad products on the market just
because of how hierarchies are formed
there's going to be good products by the
people that stick it out and actually
iterate and there's going to be bad
products by the people that one decide
to take action which is a great thing
but two they don't actually decide to
stick it out because they took the
feedback too seriously so what I'm
saying here is that don't let people
gatekeep you from actually putting
something on the market that you can
only then improve you can't improve it
before you put it on the market because
you don't have data so just teach people
how to get the results they want it's
that [ __ ] simple get better with time
and it helps to study others products or
services or just brands or content or
whatever so that you have inspiration
for your own and you actually understand
how to structure it so buy courses look
at content actually be inside this
economy Creator economy that you're
trying to join because again if you want
a job then go pay for an overpriced
degree if you want a life of work then
pay a few bucks here and there for a
course book or whatever that allows you
to do so so that's it for the end of
this video Happy value creating if you
will but courses products links in the
description for all that stuff uh the
art of focus book is still about to
launch its pre-order will be going out
soon just stay tuned for that we're just
patiently waiting for things to be
approved for certain things to come in
uh but yeah aside from that like
subscribe thanks dudes and dudettes
might have gotten canceled there peace
