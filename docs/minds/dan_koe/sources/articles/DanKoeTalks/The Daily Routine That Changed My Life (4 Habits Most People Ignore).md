if you don't create a routine you will
be assigned one if you don't create a
purpose you will be assigned one if you
don't create a career you will be
assigned one people are too quick to
adopt the structure that somebody else
created to ease life's uncertainty you
need a routine and if you think you
don't you may not realize that you have
already been assigned one by Society or
your routine is not having a routine
without rules there is no game without a
game there is no winning a routine
contains the rules for how you live your
life the longer you play the better you
get and as you're getting better you
often forget the rules and win anyways
now is the time to stop playing the game
Society told you to play and start
playing your own a powerful routine no
matter how long prevents overwhelm as
you progress towards your goals most
people are progressing towards goals
that were given to them they are
progressing the dreams of someone else
rather than their own without a routine
that you created your life will slowly
fall faster and faster down a chaotic
hole into a life of responsibilities
work people and a personality that you
despise routines are comfortable and the
mind craves order routines allow you to
focus your attention when conditioned
and programmed over time to make action
seamless this is why working a job sucks
but not enough to make you quit and
pursue something that sucks more until
it sucks less life is suffering and you
have the ability to choose what you
suffer for every single day your goals
are the axis of your suffering and most
people are pursuing goals that aren't
their own their suffering doesn't bring
fulfillment here's a quote from mihi
chiet mihi the optimal state of inner
experience is one in which there is
order in Consciousness this happens when
psychic energy or attention is invested
in realistic goals and when skills match
the opportunities for Action the pursuit
of a goal brings order and awareness
because a person must concentrate
attention on the task at hand and
momentarily forget everything else so we
need to talk about how to focus your
attention to reverse psychic entropy or
disorder in the mind but we also have to
understand how Identity or personality
comes into play here you don't need
motivation or discipline when you are
the person who would take certain
actions a bodybuilder doesn't need
motivation to eat healthy a gamer
doesn't need discipline to stare at a
screen all day a writer doesn't need
motivation to synthesize ideas an
employee doesn't need discipline to show
up to work all of those could be
perceived as positive or negative by a
specific type of person a gamer that
stares at a screen all day that could be
considered very bad if you aren't
actually in the pursuit of goals that
you chose for yourself and you have to
understand bringing back the idea that
your goals are the axis of your
suffering where if you want to be let's
say a professional gamer there's nothing
wrong with that but you have to accept
the potential decline in health that
will come from that and that is
subtracting from other areas of your
life so that you can succeed in another
area of your life the same thing goes
for like a bodybuilder as the first
example where eating healthy isn't hard
or they don't need motivation or
discipline to do it but it could
subtract from other areas of their life
like having a social life going out
letting loose a bit certain people value
certain things based on their identity
and where they focus their attention so
these people do what they do because
their survival is at stake and this
isn't physical survival here this is
mental animals survive the information
in their genetic code humans survive the
information in their Consciousness
animals survive their physical form and
while we do that too we've also
transcended that plane into the mental
plane thanks to self-reflective
Consciousness and that meaning
self-reflective meaning that we are
aware of our self our idea the mental
form that we are attempting to survive
the the web of ideas that creates our
personality or identity that when
threatened feels like a physical threat
and the information that we are fed as
children that programs who we are the
the things that we know the known not
the unknown what is familiar to us what
we're aware of for our survival and for
most people this is limited to a
microscopic fraction of reality that is
go to school get a job retire at 65 in
terms of choosing a career for others
it's go to church every Sunday but you
get the point here that's all you know
and so that's that's the tool for your
survival that's the knowledge that
you're using to survive it's the ideas
when one of those are threatened or
questioned then you can feel that threat
response where if a bodybuilder that
likes to eat healthy only has the option
to eat unhealthy food he's probably not
going to be very happy he's going to be
very stressed he's going to be out of
routine he's going to be in the unknown
he's going to be in the unfamiliar area
of of life and he's going to have to
deal with it however he can so back to
the point the information we are exposed
to as children and throughout our lives
programs our minds to run on certain
systems a system in brief is the process
of reaching a goal obviously this can
get extremely complex so let's just keep
it to that a system is the process of
achieving a goal so our identity is a
web of conscious and unconscious goals
that determine the skills we acquire the
interests we learn and the choices we
make in alignment with those goals when
we are programming our mind or
programming the systems in our mind the
information roads that our mind operates
on they're all operating towards
specific goals relating to survival and
other things and so we're just making
decisions every day based on the
information that we've collected in the
systems that have formed in our minds
over time you are already acting toward
layers of unconscious goals every second
of the day they've been conditioned to
the point of not requiring conscious
thought you wake up walk brush brush
your teeth maybe and put on your clothes
so that you aren't seen as an outcast
these are all skills that you have
developed as a human with the goal of
fitting in and surviving in society this
goes deep the social Matrix of goals
creates humans that all operate in a
similar fashion with a slightly
different goal of society we could all
be walking around naked and
communicating with each other by tapping
people on the head with a stick
biological goals clearly influence this
when we don't have Clarity on how to
achieve a goal our mind becomes
disordered we become overwhelmed anxious
and narrow-minded because the challenge
of the goal does not match the skill
that we have our mind starts to decline
into chaos this is known as entropy
entropy is universal it doesn't only
apply to things like buildings that fall
apart with time and less maintained the
structure of your mind or identity is an
invisible building you reverse entropy
by making a goal conscious creating a
path to achieve it and focusing your
attention on priority actions that bring
results as feedback these priority
actions revolve around daily
self-education in practice so that you
expose yourself to the information that
creates a new identity with time and
then that new identity allows you to
perceive certain situations as
advantageous towards your conscious
goals and you start to see problems in
situations as opportunities so we'll
talk about how to master new skills fast
in a future video but for now just
understand this lesson you need a plan
there isn't any other way because if you
don't have one Society does and they've
been planning your life for decades if
you don't set your own goals acquire the
skill necessary to take on the challenge
and Forge your own path your destiny
will be manhandled by society and you
won't even realize it nobody wants to
wake up 40 years later wondering where
the time went now let's discuss the four
pillars of the good life this is how we
reverse entropy or in simpler terms this
is how we reverse the downward spiral
into chaos overwhelm anxiety when we
don't have the clarity to achieve our
goals becoming multi-dimensionally
jacked is the path to the good life I
talk about this in the video on becoming
multi-dimensionally jacked you need four
habits one that builds your mind one
that builds your body one that builds
your business one that builds your
relationships the good life is the
process of becoming everything you could
be all of these domains of life are
interconnected systems that create who
you are and reverse entropy in the mind
tiny improvements are what create an
ordered mind and so just to bring
Clarity to this Mind Body business
relationships that is what composes who
you are those are the four main pillars
that we have to peel back improve and
evolve on a daily basis those are the
main things that are within your control
and they're also the Eternal markets in
business I talk about this in the onep
person business videos or any of my
business videos is that the Eternal
markets health wealth relationships and
happiness are where most burning
problems lie those are the most
profitable problems to to solve so if
you can solve your own problems and sell
the solution that's how you do what you
want for a living by solving the
problems that make your life better and
selling them to make other people's
lives better that's value exchange you
exchange the solution to a problem that
makes someone else's life better in
exchange for what you want which is
money so by adopting a daily habit for
each pillar of your life success becomes
inevitable my question to you if you
aren't building your mind body business
and relationships every single day what
are you doing here's a genuine question
is there anything more important than
that or is everything you do now a
distraction but Dan I want to enjoy
myself and do what I want do you
understand what enjoyment is when
compared to pleasure do you realize that
human psychology has been mapped over
the course of evolution to show that
humans have an innate drive to grow
expand transcend and create enjoyment is
found in progress doing what you want is
often the ego ending the train of
thought that would lead to you in
improving yourself because that's what
your nature wants is to improve yourself
you can truly do what you want when you
peel back the layers of what you think
you want so I'm not going to give you a
super scientific approach to Habit
formation I'm just going to give you the
only real way to make Behavior change
seamless with time so the first step is
to align your future with a holistic
goal for those that don't know what
holistic means it means all encompassing
or you're viewing it from the whole of
the situation rather than a part of the
situation big picture so this requires
you to zoom out and see beyond a narrow
problem like if you're having money
problems right now that's not the only
domain of your life that needs
Improvement and as a matter of fact
money is interconnected to all other
domains of your life so solving your
money problems may not actually happen
until you choose to zoom out and change
every single domain of your life in
other words changing who you are on a
fundamental level goals can't exist
without the awareness of a problem goals
and problems create a frame for your
perspective your perspective determines
what information you perceive as
important a person with money problems
and the goals of society will see a new
job opportunity as important a person
who has money problems and
self-generated goals will see a business
opportunity as important both people
will read a book and interpret it in a
completely different way whether it's
the Bible or a self-help book or a
fiction book or or whatever it is the
problems and goals that are framing your
current perspective are going to
determine the information that you see
as important within that book you're
going to highlight different quotes from
someone else because it is going to be
relevant and relatable to your situation
so if you're a writer or a Creator or a
oneperson business or anything of that
nature a Creator in general who you are
then you have to understand that this
comes into play when you're writing or
Distributing products or just giving
things to other people and you want want
it to relate to them you want them to
perceive it as important is you have to
understand the problems and goals that
are on their mind so you can frame what
it is that you're giving to them writing
products Creations whatever videos so
that it does actually register in their
awareness this is marketing in sales as
a whole is just understanding the goals
and problems of your target audience and
providing Clarity in between or a
solution a product a system a how-to
video whatever it is you help people
people transform the first step to
changing your life is to become brutally
aware of the problems that make you want
to change your life if you're reading
this then you obviously have problems
everybody does the big problem is a lack
of awareness of your problems sit and
become negative for a while let your
mind run wild to create an anti- vision
for your future what is the worst case
scenario if you continue with the same
mental physical financial and relational
actions you are taking then use that as
a place to toss an anchor into the
future create a big Vision generating
goal that encapsulates each domain of
Life Next we will bridge the gap between
where you are and where you want to be
with self-education and skill
acquisition so step number two after
creating a holistic goal is to treat
daily self-education as an absolute
necessity schools are necessary in many
cases but they teach you a fraction of
what actually exists in reality they
train you into a compartment of reality
like chemistry physiology or literature
and regard for the holistic
interconnectedness that breeds true
intelligence without self-education you
go through life with the same narrow
identity and perspective as everyone
else you're not a unique individual if
you never self-educate you're the same
as everyone else being fed the same
information from the social Matrix of
goals that are assigned to you to
operate within Society now this social
Matrix isn't a bad thing it creates an
intellectual structure to Anchor our
attention so that we can actually
survive here but outside of that what
what's more are you just surviving or
are you creating education expands your
mind it introduces you to novel
perspectives it increases dopamine in
the brain as a consistent source of
energy it gives you the knowledge to act
with Clarity toward your goals over time
education conditions your mind to run on
New systems if you were to only immerse
your mind in information that taught you
how to build a profitable business you
would and if you sit back and think
about how building a business is a skill
just like anything else and a skill
comes from mental programming and
practice then you'd understand the truth
in this where programming your mind with
specific information that eventually
creates actions conducive to your goals
over time your goal being building a
business then you would actually do that
thing self-education is where most
people lack because they just skip it
entirely they don't have a section of
their morning dedicated to reading or
consuming or researching or pushing into
the mental unknown so they can discover
New Perspectives to integrate into their
own to expand themselves cuz if you
think of business building as a skill
just like learning to walk Walking is a
very difficult skill it's hard
it takes children a long time to do but
they still do it and now it's automatic
to the point where you don't think about
it it's like a basketball player that
has played for so long and has gone pro
to the point where they're not even
thinking about what they're doing
they're just playing and having fun in
the game and do very well that way and
so if you get to the point where you've
practiced and educated yourself on
business making money becomes seamless
and don't let your lack of knowledge
hold you in a narrow mind right here you
can make as many judgments and
assumptions and projections into a
future you haven't experienced or
understand right now but that's not
going to change the reality of what
skill acquisition is and being able to
train yourself to achieve any goal that
you want it took you 18 plus years to
shape your actions with education from
your parents friends and schools it's
going to take a few years to shape your
your actions with information that you
curate so step number three after
setting a holistic goal and treating
self-education as an absolute necessary
practice step number three is acquiring
the skill set necessary to achieve those
goals the difference between where you
are and where you want to be is skill
this is a fact you don't have the
results you want because you aren't the
person with the skill that would get
those results the only thing that can
stop you is getting distracted to the
point of falling off the path skills can
be trained as I said before learning to
walk and speak are arguably the most
complex skills you've ever learned they
are more complex than building a
million-- dooll company the thing is you
didn't have a mind chained by limits
that you were taught by people who
didn't break through their own with this
you need two things one is a 30 to 60
Minute self-education habit read buy
courses listen to podcasts and acquire
ample knowledge that provides you the
capability to act step two is a 30 to 60
Minute building habit apply apply your
knowledge in reality and experiment with
what you learn get feedback and iterate
until success learning comes from
struggle not memorization when you build
in the real world and you hit a wall a
problem is created it's presented to you
you may or may not become aware of the
problem depending on your skill and
experience this is what prevents most
people's progress they blame their lack
of progress on anything but their own
ability the problem sits in your
subconscious mind to filter the
information you get from your
self-education as you repeat this
process of education and building for 1
to 5 years you will be a struck by how
far you've come now let's talk about my
daily routine I will provide reasons and
wise behind each part of my routine but
this is an important point every aspect
of your routine should be intentional
intention equals what you are stretching
towards the more reasons or wise you can
stack behind your actions the easier it
becomes and the more beneficial it is to
a great future you discover these Reas
reasons or Wise by having a goal to
apply your self-education to if I want
to commit to a gym habit self-education
around habit formation and the gym will
give me the reasoning necessary to do so
if and only if I am building in reality
please note that my routine may not be
feasible for you I'm not presenting this
as just a piece of the puzzle to plug
into your day please also note that this
is the result of five plus years of
experim actually 10 plus years of
experimentation to find what I person
personally deemed enjoyable and
conducive to the ideal future that I
want to create I encourage you to take
bits and pieces of my routine as
inspiration for your own so that you can
test and experiment with something that
may not have crossed your mind earlier
so the first thing that I do is I take a
30 minute morning walk first thing in
the morning around 6:00 a.m. I get
outside no matter the weather or how I
feel I will either listen to a podcast
or educational material or just plan out
my day on my phone I aim for around 15
to 20,000 steps a day just because of
the Stacked benefits that it brings my
life walking is one of those activities
that requires minimal effort but brings
maximal results walking clears my mind
wakes me up gets me away from
distractions acts as a creativity Block
in my day keeps me lean keeps me healthy
keeps me slightly tan and reverses most
of the Damage Done by sitting under life
sucking blue light note that I'm
experimenting with different blocks of
my morning right now the past few days I
tried meditating and eting in the
morning like 15 minutes of each today I
just got straight into work and so I'm
I'm just testing things right now as I
always do I don't let my routine get
stagnant because there's always a way to
improve and if I don't experiment then I
eventually get trapped in the known
until I realize that I have to change my
routine because everything in life must
evolve so the second thing that I do is
90 minutes of focused work I have a list
of recurring tasks and levers that I
execute every morning this is when I
write things like books new newsletters
content and marketing material I stack
all of my priority tasks in this work
block so I can complete them before most
people wake up this allows me to
gradually introduce entropy into my day
as work becomes less structured so a
soft plug is that I teach how to become
a digital writer in my course to our
writer this is the first 90 minutes of
my morning and the 30 minutes before on
a walk is idea generation and writing
for literally everything that has like
everything good that has come in my life
like this YouTube video is a written
script so step three is that I go on
another 30 minute walk or I run so I've
been running three times a week for
about 30 minutes so Monday Wednesday
Friday and this is just to hit the
general recommendation of like 15
minutes of Zone 2 cardio a week I do
this three times a week for 30 minutes
so that's not 150 minutes but I trust
that my 15 to 20,000 steps will cover
the rest of that zone 2 cardio so on the
days that I don't run because it's hard
for me to focus and write things down on
a run obviously so I'll walk and this is
when I listen to more podcasts Audi
books just educational material YouTube
videos that I really like and I collect
ideas in my phone using cortex cortex
isn't out yet but I get to use it and
I've been using this system for a long
time now for capturing ideas that
actually have a use case which is
writing or creating step four is again
another 90-minute Focus work block so
after my run or walk I shower eat
breakfast and I sit back down to work
during this block I do less creative
tasks this is when I help with like
administrative work or client work or uh
introducing myself to more people like
responding to clients or people that I'm
working with and this is when open loops
and distractions really start to take
over so this is why I have it later in
my mornings because at the very start of
my morning I want to make sure I get
everything I have to for the day done so
that I don't have to worry about it the
stuff that isn't really necessary like
me responding to people which is kind of
necessary but it's not as like it's not
as lever moving as writing content every
single morning so open loops and
distractions happen here but that can
just be mitigated by another walk and
I've broken down my deep work routine
before I forget what the video is called
but it's one of my most popular videos
so if you go to my popular videos it's
like the third or fourth one so step
five is I take calls or I go on another
walk if you've been following me for a
while this is a new block because I've
gone over my routine before obviously
but I used to despise calls and I remov
them completely from my day I stopped
client work I stopped all calls but with
cortex the software that I'm building
this isn't possible anymore and I had to
accept that even though it threatened my
identity we were talking about mental
survival I adopted a person that doesn't
take calls as my identity and it was
actually kind it had a lot of friction
for me to like start to incorporate that
consistently into my days and the thing
here is when I zoom out I want cortex to
succeed more than I don't want to take
calls therefore I want to take calls so
these calls as we're building cortex the
software we're already monetizing we're
already on track for the revenue numbers
that I mentioned in the previous video I
won't break those down now but I'll
break them down in a future video about
how we built cortex to x million before
the software even released so with that
we're taking on Consulting clients for
cortex that's how we're monetizing so if
you actually want to be a client of ours
and work with us directly to learn
writing speaking Marketing sales brand
content product promotion with our
systems in either group setting or
oneon-one there's a link to apply to
work with us below so most days now I
work 4 to 5 hours and even with my
excessive workload I'm still close to
that 4-Hour workday philosophy that I
always talk about now of course my work
goes over this occasionally because I
have a lot more on my plate and it's a
lot more unpredictable cuz I'm also
launching a book recording the audio
book for the next 3 days tomorrow I'm
going to be working more than 4 hours
those days alone so it's all variable
but I'm talking talking Baseline like
what I'm continuously working back to
and using that philosophy as a way to
identify problems like working over four
hours in order to create systems and
solutions that allow me to do what I do
better in that time block so these calls
include things like client calls or
internal company calls or design calls
or development calls or product build
calls and our progress on that and if I
don't have to be at my desk then I'll
take these calls on a walk and if I
don't have any calls for the day then I
just go on a walk soep step six is that
I go to the gymm by now it's around 1:
to 2: p.m. and this is the turning point
where my day goes from work to rest I
know that I won't be able to operate my
best after the gym so I treat this as a
work cut off time now for the past I'd
say 6 months I trained every day and
since workload is piling up I might
switch back to 3 days a week I'm going
to experiment with that this week but I
used to train every day and please I
don't need your training ideology don't
tell me about it I've studied all of
them I like training every day so step
number seven after the gym is just
having a long conversational lunch with
my editor so that we can catch up and
kind of just socialize and uh talk about
things that aren't business just have a
good laugh together have a good lunch
because myself and him and my friends
keep their Social Circle extremely small
I used to have a lot of contacts before
and it just it just doesn't make sense
anymore because that seem to always
subtract from my life rather than add to
it so I'm not it's not that I'm not open
to adding new people to my life it's
that I've just reached a place where I
have to be very careful with who I let
into my life step number eight is that I
take a nap or I go on another walk or I
finish busy work so it's about like 3:
to 4:00 now and things are starting to
get boring here so I'll spare you that
but this is the part of my day where
it's dedicated to psychological recovery
so I'll either do like very easy busy
work that helps me catch up or I'll just
take a nap or I'll recover my mind
because like in the gym you have to take
rest like with work you also have to
take rest so step number nine the last
step is that I'll either go to dinner
with a friend or I'll stay in and spend
time with my girlfriend I love nice
dinners like that's one of the bad
habits of mine even though I don't think
it's a bad habit like that's really the
only thing that I spend a lot of my
money on is just good food good
experiences good dinners and when I eat
out like when you eat at a nice place
it's kind of hard to eat like crap like
it's hard to be unhealthy because most
of the meals there are they have
protein like steak or fish and then they
have like potatoes it's just a nicer way
of preparing the dinner that I would
have prepared for myself and so most
nights I'll go out to dinner or I'll
just stay in and watch Netflix with my
girlfriend and that's really my entire
day now obviously there's other events
in life like me recording the audio book
tomorrow for the art of focus or going
up to spend some time in the mountains
or traveling somewhere or just like
doing other things right but I'm talking
about the Baseline routine that I fall
back to every every day so I truly hope
that helped maybe it gave you some
inspiration if it did like and comment
