in today's world one of the worst things
you can do is get trapped in the mind of
the noble broi many intelligent people
that I know hate the thought of
Marketing sales and online business
because they think it's below them even
if they don't say that explicitly they
think that and you can tell that they
think that from what they say they get
locked into what they think is a quote
unquote higher perspective that
demonizes the sleazy salesman in reality
this is an illusion this higher
perspective is is filled with
misunderstanding a lack of empathy and
hate it is on par with if not a lower
level of Consciousness than the sleazy
salesman himself this is similar to how
Republicans and Democrats fight or how
carnivores and vegans fight people get
trapped in a specific ideology and they
identify with it so it becomes their
identity and something that threatens
their survival when the idea of their
identity is threatened and so when they
engage in these narrow-minded
discussions or arguments of the online
business person versus the everything is
a scam person or everyone should go out
and live in the woods and do nothing and
meditate all day person when this
happens there is no chance at
discovering the holistic truth of the
situation obviously both extremes are
wrong so let's deconstruct what is at
least a bit closer to truth so that more
people can see more progress in life and
so that the sleazy salesman might be
able to find purpose in their business
and the noble broi has the ability to
actually make more of an impact on the
world and help raise the collective
Consciousness more so let's start with
this if you don't start a business to
provide information education and goods
that make a better Humanity then
unethical businesses rise to the top
without competition making a worse
Humanity the reason that unethical
businesses flood the marketplace is that
you aren't as conscious or intelligent
as you think you are you are directly
contributing to Evil by not starting a
business to raise the collective
Consciousness by doing nothing but
demonizing money and businesses that are
the lifeblood of society you are
assigned a job where the employer is
more than likely unethical by your
standards you won't start a business
because of your delusional assumptions
and conditioning that it is unethical to
make money but you are working for a
business that makes the population sick
contributes to bombing people across the
world and locks employees into robotic
routines so that they wouldn't dare
achieve their potential people criticize
new Creator education businesses as
quote unquote griffs and scams for
solving the only true problems that will
raise the Baseline consciousness of
humanity people who sell education
courses and coaching in the health
wealth relationships and happiness
domains of life are attacking the root
of positive behavior change I discuss
the importance of education and
information not only in terms of you
learning in a decentralized manner but
also you Distributing information in the
video you have $100,000 worth of
knowledge stuck in your head if humanity
is only as strong as its weakest link
and 99% of people suffer from the same
survival problems and education is what
allows the individual to solve their own
problems rather than being prescribed
temporary relief and problems are what
prevent personal to Collective Evolution
and if the education system is focused
on training people into jobs for its own
benefit then the new Digital Society of
value creators is one realistic path out
of this mess back to the main argument
by doing nothing you allow people less
conscious and intelligent than you to
have more attention impact and money
than you money creates a ripple effect
that allows people to spread their
message further it also allows them to
employees and build their business more
and more to take its roots in society
and money allows you to have the
resources to compound the attention you
hold as an individual or a company so if
that company leans towards the more
unethical side then they're going to
have a lot more attention than you and
if it leads more towards the conscious
side then the same thing happens but
it's going to lead to birthing more of
that I think one of the big issues here
is with the the hypers spiritual people
the ones that have adopted that as an
identity when it's not meant to be it's
supposed to be a lens that you can take
off and put on to view situations in a
certain way preferably a big picture
point of view so you can get the whole
picture and not narrow yourself into
this ideological trap of what you think
spirituality is and so when you get
trapped in this and if the entire goal
of spirituality is connection to
something larger than yourself and money
in the material world is a way to
connect with society as a whole and
distribute goods and information that
benefits them that's another main
problem is so many spiritual people
think that buying a product or service
can't help a specific person and when
you peel that back and you think about
it you know that that's wrong but the
unconscious assumption is just that that
it that everything related to money is
evil when everything near you you
watching this right now is only possible
because of money and I've also heard
arguments about like sacred economics
where we need to go back to a gifting
Society or how our ancestors lived where
you like exchange Serv service for
service and in some cases sure I
understand that and you should gift more
but if I want a house or I want a shower
that works or I want something else
there isn't something that I can trade
for that in a scalable manner that
allows the unification of society or
Humanity or allows it to scale and
actually bring a better quality of life
to everyone there has to be a currency
the only way you can stop people from
paying attention to one thing is to give
them something more persuasive to pay
attention to the issue is not as simple
as just starting a business to make
money everything is connected and you
are unconsciously allowing the entire
universe to tilt in the hands of Evil by
not becoming a conscious business owner
that impacts his customers employees
readers economy and the rest to Infinity
spirituality is understanding your part
in the whole of the universe
spirituality is not disconnecting from
that hole to live in the woods and
letting the universe decline into chaos
thanks to entropy spirituality then can
be considered and felt when you attempt
to reverse entropy by putting effort and
energy into the progress and evolution
of humanity so a quote from nche to kind
of sum this up happiness is the feeling
that power increases that resistance is
being overcome we can feel this on the
personal level and we have felt this
when we're making progress on something
whether it's in business which is a
value for making progress we've all felt
this on the personal level when we're
making progress in something whether
it's a personal project or a hobby or
learning something new that we wanted to
learn or if it's in business which is a
vessel for making progress and
distributing that to the collective
that's when the feeling of progress
compounds that's when it really gets
spiritual is when you help people make
progress from the progress that you are
making so my question here to wrap this
section up is if you hate money do you
not hate your life everything around you
right now from the phone in your hands
to the roads you drive on to the desk
you sit at to the food that keeps you
alive are all products from a business
that makes money for their contribution
to the advancement of civilization you
are drowning in a world that was built
by the drive of money stemming from
survival so before we begin the price
increases have stopped on the art of
focus box I Believe by now but either
way um it may be open it may be closed
it may be sold out maybe not uh check
first link in the description for my
book The Art of focus or if you're
watching this later down the road and
the actual paperback is out then I
encourage you to check out my book now
we need to talk this is so important we
need to talk about the importance and un
ignorability of money so here's
something that I see people say quite
often the best way to make money is
teaching others how to make money some
people say this as wisdom and then
others use it as a way to comment on
some form of money-making advice to and
act like it just dismantles the entire
argument so that they don't have to face
reality and go and make money for
themselves like when you see this in the
comment section of a video where
someone's actually giving out decent
advice on how to make money and then
then this comment just comes in acting
like it obliterates everything they just
said and they're like the only way you
make money is by teaching people how to
make money so let's peel this back let's
actually think about this think for once
some people see what I just said of the
best way to make money is teaching
others how to make money as a bad thing
when Money Rules people's lives it is
the one thing most of the time holding
them back from reaching the next level
of their personal development it
dictates almost every single action a
person takes even the people that think
they're the most spiritual people which
is usually a lot of the times a lie
where someone reads a spiritual book
they adopt it as their identity they
change what they wear they change
everything and trust me there's people
that are truly spiritual I hate saying
it like that there's people that are
more conscious and aware and big picture
thinkers and have mastered their mind a
bit more but you know who I'm talking
about the people that act like they can
just reject the material world all
personal development all material
progress and then defend everything they
do with the spirit spiritual lens that
they've brought into their life but
money still dictates their actions
because money is deeply intertwined with
Modern Survival why do you work 8 hours
a day for 45 years because you need to
pay the bills and support your family
that is a lot of time if you think that
you don't care about money then try not
working you will probably not survive
very long why do you go off and live in
the woods like a monk because you want
to eliminate the need for money to
pursue personal development to think
this is what everyone should do is more
foolish than leaving Society to rot all
is one quote unquote until you actually
have to take responsibility for the
health of the world so you choose to
check out instead why do you go to the
gym and eat healthy foods to be healthy
yes but there's more you want to
increase your perceived status so you
can attract better opportunities Advance
your career and make more money why am I
speaking to a camera right now to help
you out yes but there is always more
than one reason for someone to do
something this is another thing I see on
soci social media a lot is like when I
say something and they're like oh you're
only saying this because of this or this
is even more common you know this is a
prime example where you see someone
online and they post a picture of their
physique like a bodybuilder and they're
like oh that was only possible because
of steroids and you can instantly filter
out like high and low Consciousness
people in the comments but because they
can't zoom out and think oh yeah it
actually took some work and effort and
more discipline than that person has
ever had in their life to actually
achieve that physique so back to that
why am I speaking to this video because
it's how I make money I do this on a
weekly basis because I get paid to do so
and as I said there are more reasons or
wise behind that I can very well stop
doing this and go make money another way
there's a good feedback loop here where
I enjoy talking to you guys you guys
enjoy my content it's as close to the
Japanese concept of ikag guy as it can
be and so why are you watching this it's
to get a new perspective yes it's to
learn something new yes maybe you like
maybe you want to comment about how I
shouldn't have cut my hair but it will
open your mind to reduce the limiting
beliefs you have around money and that's
the same with any of my videos why do
you watch my lifestyle design videos or
productivity videos or mindset videos
it's because it's going to make you a
higher value individual that can make
more money is that the only reason no go
back to what I just said there's
multiple reasons money being a part of
almost every single thing you do one of
the reasons behind it so if you look at
maso's hierarchy of needs and you just
read them most of them require money
nowadays and the financial domain of
life is a domain just like any area of
life I would argue that is pretty well
it's intertwined with all other domains
but it's it's spiritual it's physical
it's mental it's all of these things and
how like in a skill tree in a video game
where one skill can only go as high as
the other allows it like I can't unlock
the next level of mind if I don't unlock
a certain level of finances or I can't
unlock a certain level of Health like I
can't afford the right Foods or like if
I don't have the time then I can't order
the right food I have to pay for like
McDonald's every day there's specific
thresholds that you have to reach in
each domain of Life finances being one
of them to even reach a certain level in
something else like spirituality you
have to overcome and integrate that part
of life it's value exchange that's like
connection with human beings or Society
when you ignore the need for money you
limmit how far you can go in your mental
physical and even spiritual practices so
my point here back to like the original
saying is that everything is teaching
people how to make money some are just
more direct and honest about it than
others and like even let's take this an
as an example why do you go to school
for 12 to 24 years of your life to
increase your earning capacity that's
why everyone's going why does almost
everyone make the decision to go to
college like they choose a specific
college to go to because it's going to
help them make money in in the future
for now like if you don't care about
money why does everything you do revolve
around it do you understand what I'm
saying here but when you make that
conscious and you accept that that is
how this world operates you'll be much
better off and you'll see a lot more
progress in every area of your life
another thing here is what do they teach
in school is it only how to make money
explicitly or is it other interests and
skills and just education that allows
you to get to that point now back to the
topic of the Creator economy do you not
see that the only way to make money in
the new economy is from people who
created the jobs and opportunities to
make money in that economy people are
always like oh creators are grifting and
scamming because they're like I don't
know they're teaching what they know
they teach they're teaching what they've
done they're passing down their lessons
and people frame that as like oh it's a
pyramid scheme because he's doing this
so he's teaching the other person how to
do this and it's like that's the only
thing you actually can sell ethically is
your experience so the point is just
because you don't understand it doesn't
mean it's useful schools teach outdated
and less profitable ways to make money
because more profitable ones emerged
with the creation of the internet just
like how more profitable jobs emerged
after the creation of like a tractor or
everything else by viewing everything as
a scam you are delaying your development
by years if not your entire life this is
the phase of evolution we are in and you
are missing out on what will be the new
normal until the next thing emerges and
then people see that as crazy because
every new idea is perceived as blasphemy
or just like crazy because people can't
understand it yet now let's dig a bit
deeper into the fact that you can't
avoid learning unethical skills the most
successful people are those who study
unethical tactics and use them in an
ethical way sales marketing persuasion
hypnosis influence game their work
business and pursuit of lofty goals are
the modalities for integrating their
Shadow and I teach all of these except
for hypnosis in digital economics and so
these things are all the same thing when
you zoom out and view them from a 30,000
foot point of view to see the principles
of what they're all pointing at all of
these unethical skills are just
understanding human nature they are
Understanding Psychology and the
patterns of the universe like
storytelling so here's a quote by go if
I said that right music is liquid
architecture architecture is Frozen
music meaning everything has this story
structure human nature the path in your
life the story that you're living out
the problems the climaxes the rising
actions the inclusions everything that's
what marketing and sales is if you've
studied it you understand that you're
guiding people through that Journey
you're guiding people towards the
transformation for a better life and
that's what makes money that's what
people want and that's what people pay
for everyone has a dark side like the
ugly underside of a floor rug or the
bass note of a song the universe is a
balance of creation and destruction
unity and division birth and death
buildings are destroyed so new ones can
be built your past self dies so your
ideal self can burth
you are not pure good it is impossible
to be pure good when good is relative
and would not exist without evil like if
you don't have something good to compare
to against bad then it's not good so
people that try to suppress this rather
than integrate this have that dark side
manifest in unconscious ways they are
often more manipulative than the people
that do Marketing sales and other things
consciously when you are talking to any
other human being when people are coming
at you and saying oh money is evil
you're persuading me you're selling me
you're marketing me you're doing the
same thing just unconsciously and more
manipulative I can break down exact like
your exact argument and put it up neck
and neck with a landing page or sales
page that you think is scammy and
unethical and I can show you the exact
parts that match up and how your message
is the exact same because it's human
nature getting a sales job or starting a
marketing business is a great way to
integrate Your Shadow you are given a
choice to use skills for good or evil
you get to see that outcome and how it
impacts you and your customers spiritual
Masters are not all good they've just
learned to integrate the bad and not let
their song of a life be written as a
depressing one there will be lows in
your story but when you zoom out how
will it turn out a good way to think
about your skill stack here is like a
mutual fund if if one stock goes down if
that stock is an unethical skill or
something that is perceived as unethical
or can be used more unethically because
it's neutral until put in the hand of
the good or evil the mutual fund can
still be up your life can still be
positive your skill stat can still be
impactful like in a song There are bass
notes there are lows there's those
depressing moments but then there's a
chorus and it brings everyone out of it
and you're happy all of a sudden the
song a song can be very good even if
there's a slow and sad part of it
another thing here is that if one skill
is unethical that may be the unlock your
business needs to actually see some
progress now let's go a bit deeper with
the idea that to be human is to
transcend expand and create the world is
going mental as a species we are
transcending the physical thanks to
technology science and computational
power we are unifying as a species the
unity of Consciousness through
technology would that have been possible
without money if technology is going to
be what allows Consciousness to unite or
Humanity to unite or Minds to unite was
there any other way to get to this point
of technological advancement without
money therefore like something that is
extremely good for Humanity is the
byproduct of money and you hate money
and you can't see that as something that
is limiting you severely While most see
social media as a net negative to
humanity I couldn't disagree more social
media is where we are documenting the
collective mind we share thoughts
opinions ideas creations and our
identity we are uploading our minds to
the internet not just creators because
because content is the collective mind
social media dissolves the boundary of
how we are communicating it's like
people are waiting in line to go inside
their screens they stare at it all day
like there is a primordial poll to
become one with every other mind your
entire identity is already on the screen
anyway but there's just one barrier left
the screen so my question here is you
have the entire world's knowledge at
your fingertips how does that make you
feel you have the capacity to learn
expand your sense of self and start a
business that provides value to the
world one thing I find interesting is
that when kids were pulled for what they
wanted to do when they grow up the top
answer was become a YouTuber and so most
people will just see this as delusional
and impossible they're going to be like
oh silly kids why would you want to do
that go and get a real job but I see it
as natural and potentially the only
option in the future not just like a
YouTuber but a Creator who you are being
human doing what you want to do studying
your Curiosities leaning into what makes
you you and then Distributing that value
to the world through through your unique
mind most people want to label wanting
influence and attention as vanity but
few people realize that reasoning can't
be reduced to a singular why like I
mentioned earlier there is always
something deeper and unconscious pushing
us to act and make decisions there are
multiple wise behind our cares wants and
desires your reasoning behind your
actions becomes more holistic as you
expand and transcend to new levels of
mind so here's the like a a picture of
the conscious Consciousness scale or the
levels of conscious or levels of mind
and your level of Mind determines your
values you didn't choose to sit around
and think about money social media and
skill acquisition you make an automatic
decision based on the structure of your
psyche for many they were assigned
ideology beliefs systems and business
models that sounded good and began
defending their beliefs as the best and
only when you zoom out push into the
unknown and make progress by solving
problems that increase your level of
mind you can see money for what it truly
is a piece of paper that can benefit
yourself s and others massively now
rapid fire style a brief summary of why
you aren't successful this may trigger
you you aren't successful because you
say you want to help others but you
won't learn the skills that allow you to
help others you aren't successful
because you focus too much on Art and
then blame the market when they don't
see the value in what you have to offer
because you couldn't articulate it with
marketing and sales you aren't
successful because you focus on your
craft rather than getting your craft in
front of potential customers your
websites designs writing and other
projects that do not count until other
people see them you are delaying the
time to feedback without feedback you
can't make it valuable your first
iteration will not be valuable you
aren't successful because you have an
incomplete perspective on what business
is it is how you participate in the
advancement of humanity by creating a
product that raises the collective
Consciousness you aren't successful
because you took these points as
personal attacks close your mind to your
potential and allowed your conditioning
to rule you you aren't successful
because you don't create something
valueable that the market wants to pay
for people don't want what your ego
wants they want what Mother Nature wants
and who are you to act like you know
what that should be you aren't
successful because you find comfort in
the beliefs that you believe are high
and mighty you lock yourself into a
paradigm that prevents you from growing
as an individual you begin coping rather
than creating okay enough with saying
you weren't successful self-development
is a gateway drug into entrepreneurship
because you realize that improving
others is the next level of improving
yourself to become successful there's
one Golden Rule provide value to others
and this means two things first is that
you must cultivate your value you must
expand your mind identify problems
acquire skills to solve them and make
tangible progress in reality you can't
just sit around and learn theory all day
you must practice two you must
distribute your value you need a vessel
AKA a business to distribute a product
or service that the market wants to buy
if they don't want it it isn't as
valuable as you think in other words you
need self-development and you need other
development personal growth and business
growth business is how you provide value
to others at scale how do you cultivate
and distribute value in today's world
social media virtual reality social
media is your public school public
resume and public portfolio it holds the
holy trifacta of The Good Life Learning
building and selling you cultivate your
value by learning new knowledge you
solidify your value by building new
projects you distribute your value by
selling those projects all three result
in a more valuable skill set and mindset
so now this video was all about mindset
actually and perspective building and
other things like that if you want the
actual practical application and how to
build a business then go watch my
oneperson business playlist on my
profile or just go through my videos and
find one that pequs your curiosity and
then go down the rabbit hole from there
but aside from that uh thank you for
watching you can check out uh my book or
my courses or free stuff in the
description and aside from that thank
you for watching I'll talk to you next
time peace
