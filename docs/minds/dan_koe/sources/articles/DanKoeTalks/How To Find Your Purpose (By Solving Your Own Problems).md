ever since i can remember i have
been questioning what's possible other
people were doing what they loved for a
living for work for
just what they do in their day-to-day
life you see it all the time on social
media and other things and while some of
that can be misleading my first question
was different from most and that
question was
why can't i
do the same and recently i've seen a lot
of people on social media
and maybe this is just me in the
environment that i am immersed in but i
always see the advice where it's like
make money first
find your passion later or
make a ton of money and then
disappear and do whatever you want or
just make money make money make money
and then learn spirituality and do do
other things in your life later and that
to me now from where i'm at now that is
kind of that's just the stupidest
 advice i've ever heard in my
life they're well intentioned of course
but it's mostly to get a reaction out of
people which i'm very used to right i'm
on social media as well that's what i do
that's i
try to get
emotional reactions out of people that's
what gets attention but
it's it's clear as day when you look
and
just think like
what is that guy doing he's doing what
he loves he's kind of writing certain
things but that's what people are doing
they're both doing what they enjoy and
they're making money at the same time
and doing what you enjoy probably comes
first if you're going to build some form
of an audience in order to have people
that will pay for the value that you
want to provide right so it doesn't make
sense that one comes before the other
comes it makes sense that the other
comes before the other
you get what i'm saying and so
throughout my time not only on social
media but as a kid and just what i was
doing
well let's say i was going to the gym
and watching people on youtube to learn
how to go to the gym i i wasn't only
learning how to go to the gym i was kind
of deconstructing
uh unconsciously
what they were doing right they were
talking about things they loved they
were researching things they loved so
they could teach it to other people
that's how you teach things is you
research and then you learn and then you
teach and it made me question like okay
they're they're doing that
am i just over complicating all of this
and the answer was of course yes but uh
we all know how uncertainty is in these
times where
it's just impossible to handle most
people can't handle uncertainty and that
is probably the greatest thing that is
holding them back they're not okay with
not knowing
what their direct actions today are
going to lead to tomorrow so from me
doing this and understanding that it
isn't really uncertain it is the only
certain path you can take if you want to
do what you enjoy
uh
i've done the impossible so to say like
i wake up it's kind of weird talking to
people about this because they don't
they don't understand and that's why i
kind of stray away from talking about it
but hopefully i can talk to you guys
about it
without getting some emotional panties
in the bunch but it's like
i wake up
i go on a walk i walk like 30k steps a
day because i really love walking that's
what i do i go on a walk
not all 30k steps in the morning but
then i sit down go to a coffee shop
write
my newsletter tweets social media
content in general i have products that
are fueled with that traffic by you guys
because i provide valuable products and
services and
then after that i go to the gym
and then when i hit the gym that's cut
off time i'm done for the day if i want
to do more i can do more and i usually
do more because it's fun why wouldn't i
do more but
that's it that's what i do in my day and
i have more than enough free time to do
whatever i want because that was my aim
throughout my entire life that's what i
wanted to do and then one day it's like
oh
it actually worked what do you know but
we are here to talk about how you can
start solving your own problems and
potentially profit from finding your
purpose now that was a lot of words i
want to break it down and i want you to
first understand that your problems are
not personal
problems throughout the world and in
your own life are not personal right you
could go into the whole spiritual aspect
of things and know self and
um
survival and all those other things but
in short problems are systemic your mind
is a system within a complex system uh
your body is a system within a complex
system that has systems within it the
universe is just comprised of systems
right and you can study uh systems
thinking or just systems in general to
understand this more but a problem
that needs to be solved
at let's say the personal level
is usually the same problem that's being
solved at a collective level right so
what i mean by that is if you solve a
personal problem and you have the
information on how to clear the problem
from that system then you can clear the
problem from the system of other people
right that's all people are doing online
is they solve problems whether it be
free in the form of social media content
or paid in the form of product or
service and they're offering it to the
people that also have that same systemic
problem so let's say
uh
like emotional management that's what
spirituality for is for if you want to
study spirituality then you need to
solve your own emotional problems
through spirituality so you have
experience and then you can turn around
and teach people how you did it and
start developing your unique system to
give to them in a way that
makes sense it's all systems now i
mentioned purpose right because problem
solving and purpose go very well with
each other and so this is why i believe
that the whole
make money and then find your passion is
complete because they they're
done at the same time you make money by
solving your problems you find purpose
by solving your problems so how do you
find your purpose the first thing i like
to walk people through when this
question is asked or just when i talk
about this
is you have to think about two things
what is the big problem you want to
solve in the world
think about this it's not just going to
come to your head you have to write it
out and you have to walk you have to
rest do nothing allow the default mode
network in your brain and your
subconscious to do the work for you and
bring the answer to your conscious mind
it's called insight but
that's what you do you you question what
is the big problem i want to solve in
the world and then you think what is the
big problem i want to solve in my life
and half the time those two things are
the same
right if i want to solve
for example my purpose for quite a long
time i labeled it as i want to end human
suffering i learned that because i read
the power of now like 10 years ago and
it completely changed my life and i'm
like i want to do this for other people
because i did it for myself by reading
hi eckhart tolle's the power of now and
what do you know like
this doesn't register with many people
surprisingly when it's just clear as day
that if i solved that problem for myself
and i paid that guy money and
that solution changed my life and i
actually implemented it and i understand
how to help other people do it from my
unique experiences then
why would i not be able to make money
doing that full-time if i dedicated my
entire life to it this is where your
life's a work comes into play now if you
want kind of help doing this
um re-read
the book that changed your life
go back think back what was a good book
what's the first book that comes to mind
you should go and reread that because
not only will it change your life again
but you'll
read it in a completely different way
from a completely different world view
because your worldview is continuously
changing and you will learn a lot of new
things and you might feel that sense of
purpose in you that makes you excited
and want to
pass those teachings along to someone
else right if you feel the urge to
just like tell people what you're
learning then you're on the right path
but now before we go any deeper we have
those two questions that we asked
ourselves but you have to understand
that your core purpose has been
suppressed or layered over through
cultural societal or just general
conditioning even self-conditioning
right so the things that we have kind of
adopted as our self throughout our
entire life the things we've been told
the opinions that have been projected on
us the beliefs that we've taken on as
our own
the opinions we have that are so
important to us that if someone
challenges those opinions our survival
is threatened and we're kicked into
fight or flight so i like to think of
purpose as
a pole inward we're gonna call it the
pole but the thing about this is that
that pull that inward pull to kind of
live by your deepest purpose
is
suppressed you don't feel that pull as
much because you're so distracted from
all of the things that you're
distracting yourself with in day-to-day
life and so i want you to think of it as
this graphic that i'm going to put up on
the screen and it's it's concentric
circles right and each one gets more
shallow than the next but each line
within those circles represents a lesser
purpose so i want to read a quote from
david data who wrote the way of the
superior man
and it goes as you open yourself to
living at your edge your deepest purpose
will slowly begin to make itself known
in the meantime you will experience
layer after layer of purposes each one
getting closer and closer to the
fullness of your deepest purpose so that
was david data and what he's pretty much
saying here in my eyes and what i've
experienced
in my own life is that at the start you
need to bust through those outer
concentric circles in order to
feel that pull
inward deeper right so you you see this
a lot in young kids myself included is
that when you go through your first
breakup it's like the the
logical option or i guess emotional
option to that young kid is i need to
look better i need to get in the gym i
need to exercise and so they get
obsessed with the gym and then you get
the gym bro or the bodybuilder and they
end up loving bodybuilding for what it
is or powerlifting olympic lifting
whatever it may be but that is a surface
level purpose in a sense where once you
fulfill that and you realize oh wow like
i was doing this for the wrong reasons
then the next layer opens up for you so
you're going throughout your entire life
from surface level to profound from tip
of the iceberg to bottom of the ocean
where that profundity or profoundness is
so now you have to think what problems
are begging to be solved in your life
right now what are those surface level
or lesser purposes that you can start
pursuing with energy because they're
calling your name basic needs uh they're
calling your name
and you may not be able to hear them
because you're not open to hearing them
so do you have money problems start a
business get a better job upskill
yourself acquire new skills do you have
self-esteem issues maybe hit the gym
even if that's not a uh
a permanent solution but hit the gym and
then that'll open up a layer of like oh
no it was actually my mindset or the way
that i perceive the world and i need to
start working on that or i need to get
more social and then you start working
on that you take on a challenge that
tests your limits but you are still able
to reach that's what david data meant by
living at your edge that's what mihai
chiksetmihai talks about with flow when
the challenge and skill match within
that channel you get into flow and you
feel amazing so if you don't
know what to pursue and you haven't
started this entire self-improvement
journey then look at maslow's hierarchy
of needs here's an image
right on the top you have needs
intensity on the bottom you have
personal development so
when you start your journey
the physio physiological needs are the
ones that need the most attention and
then it goes to safety needs and then
love and belonging esteem and
self-actualization
self-actualization is closer to your
deepest purpose everyone needs to
self-actualize it is
proven i'm pretty sure it's proven
but you need to self-actualize if you
aren't you are missing out on almost
every single good thing in life but dan
how do i start
self-actualizing let's just call it that
self-actualizing define your deepest
purpose how do i start online you're
watching this video right now because
you want to figure out how and i am
trying to help you but there are
billions of gajillions of videos online
there are hundreds and thousands of
millions and billions of articles there
are courses you can purchase and maybe
trade
a night out for buying a course maybe
trade
uh
i don't know a new pair of shoes that
you want to buy so bad for a course that
will help you make money the courses are
getting better i'm telling you we're not
we're kind of getting out of the whole
uh scammy get rich quick scheme like
people are catching on the courses are
becoming much more high quality and i
believe that we are
uh advancing as a digital society in a
sense or maybe digital culture or
something like that but the courses are
getting better if you haven't bought in
a course on how to make money online and
started learning those skills
then like i don't know what to tell you
like do you want it that bad
that's a question to ask yourself i'm
not asking you that so far we've knocked
out two birds with one stone finding
purpose and solving our own problems and
knowing
how to do that in a soft way there's no
step by step i can't tell you like what
need is calling your name right now
but the there's there's a third thing
that will make this much easier for you
and that is
adopting a writing habit that is
adopting a writing habit is the thing
that changed my life the most i mean i'm
a writer now that's what i do and i
would argue that almost everyone you see
online doing what they enjoy the base
foundation of everything they do is
writing the the
the scripts for these videos and even
tick tocks reels are writing they're
written they're they're articles before
they turn into youtube videos same thing
goes with an instagram post you think
it's just a fancy design what about the
caption that captures your attention and
pulls you down
why do myself and dakota robertson and
other people get more engagement on
instagram than the the bodybuilders or
the the women that are just dressed in
nothing that supposedly get a lot of
engagement why do we get more engagement
because we know how to write effectively
and high impact in a way that captures
holds delivers value and cultivates
a human connection with people so if you
want to start with this you have to
understand that writing starts with idea
generation i have entire like free
things built out for this download the
seven days to genius ideas uh free
challenge in the description i'm also
launching a writing course soon but i i
have everything's for you in the
description just go look but why writing
why writing because if you keep things
in your head they're going to stay in
your head and they're going to be stored
somewhere in the back and then you're
just going to keep forgetting them it's
like when you write down a task you know
you have to do that and you've closed
the loop i believe it's called the
zygarnic effect in psychology where if
you try to keep all your to-do's in the
head you're just going to have no mental
energy going throughout your day but if
you write it down and let's say a to-do
app then you're closing that loop kind
of and you're freeing up that mental
energy to not have to try and remember
that right and so the same thing goes
for writing but it's literally
everything right
you're kind of documenting what you like
to talk about online or even in a
journal right that's why you journal is
to open up these new mental pathways
that you wouldn't have experienced
before because your attention is just
split and going all over
in this like thought bubble that you
have in your head right so when you
write something out and you solidify it
and you refine it and you're like this
is what i was trying to say and then
another thought pops up and you're like
oh okay yeah
that's actually a great insight i never
thought about that before and you write
it down and the next one pops up and
writing is just so fulfilling i can't
explain it
because it takes direct experience all
of these lessons or the essence or
energy behind
certain good things that people are
doing it takes direct experience and
netflix social media other things aren't
bad they're manageable in moderation but
99 of people aren't doing that and so
it's important to know
that you kind of just have to do this
you have to
break out of your comfort zone like it's
so
oh man
another video so if you want to take
part in this or you want to start
talking about the things that you like
and build leverage for the future and
potentially make an income doing what
you enjoy
then
you need to start educating entertaining
inspiring and just writing on the
internet in a public journal because
media like understand this it's not just
writing it's media is the front end of
the internet you're watching media
websites are media everything that is
not code is media if you're not learning
to code you need to learn media aka
writing and then build up from there
that's the only skill you need to learn
so what do you talk about what do you
educate entertain and inspire people on
the problems you're solving in your own
life you write to solve these problems
and understand them more right if you go
to the gym then talk about the gym talk
about what you learned in the gym teach
people the basics of lifting nutrition
whatever it may be who cares if you get
a few bad comments saying oh you're
wrong because i know the health industry
is that way if you're in the health
industry
you understand what i'm saying when you
nobody can just agree on something and
you have to accept that and you have to
talk about what is getting you results
at this very moment and why and be able
to change your mind or back that up if
you have to and that goes for any domain
people want your unique perspective they
really do that that's what this world is
is all perspectives if you can give
yours through an authentic lens which
means you are pursuing whatever purpose
you're pursuing and the energy generated
behind that is displayed
in your writing then
boom shakalaka so starting a business is
not optional for those that want more
out of life because one
uh when i say business i'm not talking
about what's like still the current
mainstream idea of you need capital you
need
you need investors you need all this
stuff no it takes one person read
company of one uh by forget his name
company of one or the million dollar one
person business by someone else forget
the name and just open your mind to the
idea that one person can earn a million
dollars a year on their own if you're
not open to that and you're already like
oh no you can't do that you're a scam
you're a liar
you lost you lost the game i'm sorry
you're not going to make any progress
until you accept the fact that people
are making ethical money doing what they
enjoy so if you're watching this i'm
assuming that you have values or just
desires or goals that are similar to
mine you want to work for two to four
hours a day and do what you enjoy you
want to
i've always had the drive to prove
people wrong right i i actually
attribute a lot of
um my progress to that is that when
someone tells me that i can't do
something then i go and do it
it's that simple but you also value
self-reliance sovereignty and just
self-sufficiency in general right not
having to rely on anyone or have anyone
to tell you what to do that doesn't mean
that you're absolving yourself of
responsibility that means you get to
choose the responsibility that you take
on and now most of this is not possible
through employment right having a nine
to five am i saying that's bad no
absolutely not i am not saying that do
not twist my words i am not saying
employment is bad and it is actually
probably the only option if if you're
watching this later and you already have
a nine to five don't quit right you have
money coming in and even like 500 bucks
a month you spend in building an
audience right you're set for life you
do that for six months you write good
content you learn how to grow on the
platform you're set you're you're
 set like that's all i did like
you are set why would you pay for ads
paid ads when you can pay to grow an
audience through organic measures with
people that actually like your content
and you keep that audience rather than
it just flowing through let's say
facebook right facebook ads doesn't make
sense and so when it comes time to
launch a product or service based on the
problem that you solved for yourself to
help other people do the same thing you
have an audience that has already read
your content and is on the same page as
you and they're going to be ready to
give you their money for something that
is extremely valuable to them because
you are helping them
get there faster now i want to talk
about surrounding yourself or being
surrounded by people that limit your
perception of money right
now this isn't a bad thing and i think
when you're just starting out you should
aim low you should aim maybe three to
five thousand dollars a month and hit
that goal but
let's say when i hit 10k a month
i was on social media and i was
connected with a guy and
he posted because
some people i'm not a huge fan of like
posting my income i see the merit in it
because of this because when he posted
his income i knew he's a trustworthy guy
i've talked to him before i knew that he
was making that amount and he said i
make a hundred thousand dollars a month
doing this it was the same exact thing
that i was doing and that immediately
like blew
it like blew the limit off of what i was
capable of because i'm like this guy's
doing the same thing as me why am i not
able to do this and then that's when i
my income blew up and it's all of it's a
game like there's infinite possibility
for the people that actually take action
on this because the the 80 20 or the 99
to 1 is always going to remain the same
like it's literally up to you to just
say i'm going to be in the one percent
of earners and then work to get there
and you'll get there right and then some
people will pass away some people will
come up it's like
never mind forget i said that because
those statistics are just going to
with your head and you're not going to
want to do anything that's just going to
be a
constant justification in the back your
head just
do things every day move levers every
single day
towards solving your own problems and
sharing how you're doing it so if you
want
just a way of doing this i have
something called the experience model
it's it's much more difficult to explain
than a few bullet points that i'm going
to include here it could take up an
entire book but in a nutshell it's
pretty much
solving your own problems and showing
how you did it online through your own
unique unique and authentic perspective
which is just how you say things right
you have to be able to take
responsibility for improving your own
business your own writing your own
problem solving skills and actually
doing things with your life and living a
good life because a lot of people think
they have to be interesting and choose a
niche and do this that another it's like
no your authentic self
is
the most unique thing in the world that
is the most niche thing in the world
that people want to follow right you can
choose a domain but
we'll talk about that in a bit but the
other thing is like oh i have to be
interesting and it's like
if you're posting online you're
interesting you're not do that's what
99 of people aren't doing is that not
interesting if you were to say oh i'm
writing on twitter or i'm writing on a
blog and people are like oh what do you
write about that's interesting right
that shows interest and now you can of
course do more interesting things and my
secret to that is kind of
uh committing myself to doing something
extreme right so setting a goal and
making it public so if i want to
deadlift 600 pounds then i'm going to
show my journey to get there and people
are going to start following along you
see this all the time in the fitness
industry so how you do this is
instead of a niche choose a domain a
domain of mastery if you will
and
what you're going to do here is you're
going to choose three interest one that
makes money
one that you just like and another
self-development because you have to
learn how to develop yourself and pursue
self-actualization and actually make
this progress and so now what you do is
you immerse yourself in a social and
digital environment that is conducive to
you hitting whatever goal you set for
yourself and that is that has people
talking about those interests in it
right you can follow people on social
media that are talking about whatever
interest you have you can read books
listen to podcasts just make all of the
information going into your head
conducive to your goals and kind of
brainwashing you to hit those goals so
the next thing is sharing what you
discover
from your unique perspective
in this
environment that you're immersed in in a
persuasive and high impact way so read
the book uh influenced by robert
cialdini
learn copywriting just study persuasion
in general and how to actually capture
hold and deliver on attention and when i
say deliver i mean make it valuable
because
like
there's no escaping this if you're like
oh i don't want to capture people's
attention that's that that's bad well
it's like then don't play the game don't
get what you want like it's it's free
for the taking but you're not going to
do it because you have some preconceived
notion that it's bad and i would argue
that that is a self-reflection of how
you you would use that skill to do
something unethical so maybe first there
needs to come moral development or
self-development to a point where you
are confident
in the value you are delivering to other
people so i could go on and on all day
about this topic but that is it for this
video if you want to check out all the
free stuff in the description or even
some of my products
i would highly encourage you to do that
and just connect with me off of social
media because the dms are just too
crowded but i appreciate you if you like
