most people even though they don't know
it are asleep they're born asleep they
live asleep they marry in their sleep
they breed children in their sleep they
die in their sleep without ever waking
up they never understand the loveliness
and the beauty of this thing that we
call human existence people are living
on autopilot they were assigned goals to
them by society when they were children
goals require a system to be achieved
and a system takes trial and error to
become more efficient you had the
biological goals of walking talking and
speaking to survive as simple as these
are for you now that wasn't always the
case your mind would receive negative
feedback from its environment like your
parents scolding you or just guiding you
in the right direction and teaching you
how to walk and showing you how to do
things by doing it themselves this would
lead to those systems in your mind
becoming more efficient with time to
achieve that biological goal you started
crawling then stumbling around then
walking like a toddler with little
balance bance and now you can hopefully
Walk Like an Olympic gold medalist can
flip through the air and stick The
Landing because they practiced achieving
that goal long enough what about the
goals of going to school getting a job
and retiring at an old age when you
don't really have much time to actually
use the rewards that you got from
retirement Society is a behavior system
and those are three big goals that they
injected into your mind right when you
learn to comprehend the language you
speak those three big goals are go to
school get a job job retire at whatever
age you can 99% of people are only
interpreting everyday situations from
the lens of those goals 99% of people
are practicing the skills and
programming their minds to live a
mediocre life without even knowing it
the masses are being shepherded to an
unfulfilling life because the systems
that compose their mind identity
perspective and perception are becoming
more efficient as they age a realization
that most people make too late is that
Success is Not planned it is is
automatic successful people whether they
were aware of it or not had a mind that
was programmed to achieve the goals that
led to their success think of your mind
as a structure of nested systems your
identity perspective and perception of
situations are all systems that feed
into and reinforce each other in that
order I am here to make you conscious of
the systems that will lead to success in
any Endeavor so there was a common
saying going around thanks to James
clear's book Atomic habits that systems
are greater than goals and people took
this literally and started just
preaching that like all over the
Internet and like if you're in the right
places of the internet you'll see people
say that like the self-improvement parts
of the internet where systems are
greater than goals but that doesn't
really make sense because one systems
can't exist without goals like a system
leads to a goal so let let's break that
down if you don't know what you want you
will be told what you want and you will
believe it 80% of living the life you
want boils down to to creating your own
goals While most people are Mindless
slaves to society's goals goals change
how you interpret situations which
influences your actions which programs
your identity which compounds over years
into the good life you can't solve a
problem unless you're aware of it you
can't become aware of a problem unless
it impacts a goal most people don't have
goals most people are afraid to make
mistakes and most people don't give
themselves a chance to improve any
aspect of their life if you aren't clear
on what you want you can't communicate
what you want to others and this sets
you up for a life of assumptions
expectations and never getting what you
want out of life nobody can help you and
you can't help yourself because one you
don't know what you want so you can't
start making the mistakes that lead to
achieving what you want and figuring out
what you don't want and using that
negative feedback to correct your own
actions with time and people can't help
you because you can't find people with
similar goals and observe them and study
their actions and reach out to them and
build a friendship with them and a
network that allows you to reach those
goals faster so instead you have the
goals in your mind of go to school get a
job marry this person watch Netflix
every night order junk food all the time
you don't have the opposite goals like
building Your Mind Body Spirit and
business that allows you to actually
spot opportunities within that domain
and another thing here is that if you
don't invest energy into a goal you
won't feel the pain of not reaching that
goal an example of this would be
something like alcohol where if you
don't have the goal of getting into good
shape or at least it's not a serious
goal on your mind something that shapes
all of your other actions then drinking
alcohol and you won't be able to see the
impact it has on your gains or your body
or your physique or your energy another
example is just starting a business if
you haven't invested the energy or made
progress toward the goal of starting a
business and you can't realize that
alcohol is holding you back from
achieving that you aren't going to feel
the pain of not achieving that goal or
if you want a thriving relationship and
it is actually a top of Mind goal that's
the thing here if it's actually an
important and serious goal to you not
just one where it's like oh that sounds
nice it has to be a part of your
identity who you are where if you want
that thriving relationship and watching
Netflix and eating junk food etc etc you
don't realize what composes a thriving
relationship with good communication
which alcohol destroys mindless
entertainment destroys junk food
destroys it lowers your performance you
don't have the awareness or the
knowledge of what leads to something
good so that your bad habits don't seem
bad because you don't know how much
progress you can make so my point here
is this most don't have a clear vision
of what they want from that goal so the
negative impact of their actions goes
unnoticed your bad habits don't seem
worth quitting because you don't have
responsibilities or prioritize those
responsibilities that deserve you at
100% capacity another example is just
like what you're okay with your
standards in Life or business if you're
okay with being with with a partner or
being in a job that is just comfortable
and you don't know what's more you're
you're kind of using it as a an excuse
to stay the same so you don't have to
improve you're not pursuing something
better than you you're not suing a
pursuing a partner that is better than
you in other areas of your life so that
you have to change who you are to act
instead you settle so that you don't
have to improve and instead you degress
and you go deeper and deeper into a hole
of mediocrity if the importance of those
responsibilities outweigh the pleasure
of your bad habits you'd stop without
question goals are intertwined with
identity and humans survive on the
conceptual level we feel threatened when
that which makes us us is threatened a
bodybuilder will feel stress and pain
when they're in an environment where
they can't perform the normal lever
moving actions that would lead to them
achieving their goals if they can't go
to the gym because they're traveling or
they can't eat healthy food because
they're in a different location they
can't buy groceries they don't have a
way of cooking it they feel threatened
you feel the stress response because a
part of you is going to die this isn't
about physical survival it is but it's
about taking care of your physical body
and surviving so that your mental form
of self can continue to exist a routine
is a set of practical goals that orders
the mind a writer who moves to a new
location or travels for an extended
period of time will have a stressful
acclamation period until their mind runs
on new systems if they can't write well
in their normal routine they feel
threatened because who they are may die
and I discussed the importance of
routines even if you think you don't
need one or if you think that you don't
have one in the video the daily routine
that changed my life for Focus habits
because the general misunderstanding
here is that you either have a goal or
you don't your mind is a web of
conscious and unconscious goals with
accompanying systems to achieve them you
had biological goals as a child to walk
eat and survive it's seamless for most
people because they practiced the system
is efficient you may have cultural goals
depending on how you were raised of
fitting in and following the safe path
according to that culture if you were to
condition your mind with new stimuli
constant self-education to the point of
having an identity that couldn't survive
without achieving new goals you would
inevitably achieve whatever they are
with ease if you want a successful
business relationship or anything that
is out of the norm you must
fundamentally change the goals your mind
operates on by changing who you are to
change who you are you must educate
practice and experience new information
to reprogram your mind's faulty wiring
that was installed by Society now let's
talk about how the mind is a system that
helps you achieve your goals the reason
you haven't achieved a goal is that you
aren't the person that would have
achieved the goal so here's a quote from
Maxwell Waltz man is by nature a goal
striving being and because man is built
that way he is not happy unless he is
functioning as he was made to function
as a goal striver thus true success and
true happiness not only go together but
each enhances the other so that quote
from psycho cybernetics matches up quite
well with this one from flow the optimal
state of inner experience is one in
which there is order in Consciousness
this happens when psychic energy or
attention is invested in realistic goals
and when skills match the opportunities
for Action the pursuit of a goal brings
order and awareness because a person
must concentrate attention on the task
at hand and momentarily forget
everything else humans are goal oriented
creatures and goals create systems
systems don't exist without goals the
mind has two key purposes for survival
one is achieving known goals and two is
discovering unknown goals the mind is an
information processing and pattern
recognition machine that we have a
certain amount of control over based on
our level of Consciousness the mind is a
system containing a complex set of
systems that accepts Rejects and uses
information to Aid in the goals you feed
it if you're always focused on negative
outcomes they will become reality
because the outcomes are the goals that
your mind is helping you achieve and in
this case you'll blame everyone else but
yourself self for your Misfortune in
life the man who conceives himself to be
a failure type person will find some way
to fail in spite of all of his good
intentions even if opportunity is dumped
in his lap the person who conceives
himself to be a victim of Injustice one
who was meant to suffer will invariably
find circumstances to verify his
opinions that's another quote by Maxwell
Waltz in other words if you think you
can you can and if you think you can't
you can't but thinking and believing
that is a part of your identity your
identity is what accepts or rejects
information that allows your mind to
form these systems so at the root of
your mind is your identity like a puppet
master identity is synonymous with
self-image or personality for the sake
of this video your identity is a system
of ideas beliefs values and standards
that shape your perspective your
perspective is like the lens of a camera
you can zoom in and out you can focus on
one part of the scene while the
background is blurred or focus on the
detail of the entire of the scene your
perspective influences your perception
of situations meaning your identity will
limit the information it can perceive
and if it receives information that does
not match its beliefs values or
standards it will reject it your mind
automatically accepts and rejects
information that aids in the achievement
of the goals that are programmed into
your head if you want to get a job or
your goal is to get a job dopamine will
signal the importance of opportunities
and information that will lead to you
getting a job what you highlight books
will reflect that goal what you take
away from conversations will reflect
that goal and remember that your mind is
not only operating on one goal it's a
plethora of goals but let's say one for
the sake of getting a job if you have
that as a goal in your mind you will
extract information from your everyday
situations that programs and conditions
your mind to achieve that goal and this
is the same thing for what you engage
with on social media will reflect that
goal if you have a job and you don't
have a goal for something better in your
life or improving your life then you're
just going to be stuck scrolling memes
all day and if you do have a goal like
getting a promotion or starting a
business and you're investing energy in
that goal already then you scrolling and
not making progress on that goal is
going to feel painful for you and you're
eventually going to have to stop because
that's negative feedback now in your
system rather than positive feedback
which is helping reinforce your mind to
stay in the job if that's your goal is
to stay in the job and just live a
comfor life if that's your goal then
you're not going to feel pain from
scrolling social media all day but the
person that wants to improve their life
and isn't making progress towards it
they're going to perceive that in a
different Manner and Nature's Compass
trial and error negative feedback from
the information that you're consuming is
going to lead to them changing their
actions over time to eventually
achieving the goal and this gets like 10
times worse with social media because
the algorithm it feeds you what you want
it helps you achieve your goals even
more so if your goal is mediocrity then
it's going to feed you all this
it's going to feed you the naked women
or dudes if you're a girl scrolling that
on social media and you really like it
for some reason or it's going to feed
you just memes and entertainment and
you're going to get trapped in the cycle
like the conditioning process compounds
and this is why 99% of people just
aren't heading towards a good life so
let's say you want to quit your job and
start a business dopamine will do the
same thing it will narrow your focus on
the information from convers ation
social media books that allow you to
achieve that goal and you're going to
store that information because it aids
in the survival of the identity that
you're trying to create because you
survive on a conceptual level and what I
mean by survival is when our ancestors
would pass by a bush I use this example
all the time is when they would pass by
a bush and it was Bare they would they
just wouldn't notice anything but then
it had new berries they would notice
that but if those berries like if they
had no use for those berries they still
wouldn't notice it but since they do do
because it aids in their survival they
will note that in their mind and they
will come back to it when they actually
need it or they'll just pick the berries
right there and store it for later and
when you do this like when you're trying
to get out of your job or go into a
business and you're that's actually like
a potent goal in your mind and you've
invested some energy into it so the
sunken cost fallacy comes into play
where I've invested this much time I
might as well just try to achieve the
goal so your Google searches will change
to best careers to go into in 2024 to
best business models to start in 2024 or
you'll be more compelled to check out
2hour writer or digital economics which
are my courses for starting a
synthesizer business in whatever year
you want to do it in their Evergreen
principles with or without knowing it we
are all reinforcing our potentially
mediocre identity that determines the
outcome of Our Lives for most people
this will be negative if you want to
change the outcome of your life change
who you are if you want to change who
you are change the direction of your
life expose yourself to new experiences
environments and information to allow
your mind a chance to discover new goals
you can adopt that will carry you toward
a better future so now we understand the
importance of goals the absolute
unignorable importance of goals they are
 important they are everything
they create your entire life so we need
to talk about the Mastery method which
is how to learn anything fast or how to
master anything fast in other words how
to achieve your goals in record time the
only people who have the choice to take
a rare path that breeds rare results are
the self Educators it's safe to say that
you're going to have to learn a lot on
this path education expands your mind it
introduces you to novel perspectives it
increases dopamine in the brain as a
consistent source of energy it gives you
the knowledge to act with Clarity toward
your goals it exposes you to the
potentials that you hadn't yet become
aware of a consistent flow of Education
increases your chances at encountering
meaningful events meaningful events
occur occur at the edge of the known
when your nervous system signals that
you should pay attention when you have
one foot in the unknown you can just
barely metabolize new aspects of reality
and put that information to use becoming
the person you want to be is the most
painful and rewarding process you can
dedicate your life to you begin this
path when you realize that the pain and
pleasure of where you are now are of
lesser magnitude than the pain of not
receiving the rewards that come from
seeing what you are capable of that's a
mouthful but it's powerful with that
let's discuss how you can M with that
let's discuss how you can Master almost
anything as you Trek towards your goals
step one is to expand your mind all real
change is identity change your level of
Mind dictates what values beliefs and
standards are available to your identity
you don't care about global problems
because you haven't solved the personal
problems that restrict your mind from
seeing them as important the purpose of
humanity is to expand your mind to that
of the universe what I mean by that is
what I talk about in my book The Art of
focus Focus where you can learn to adopt
the perspective of the universe to zoom
out and see situations for what they are
rather than getting caught up in the
petty technical details that cause your
emotional waves to go crazy like a storm
so instead you use your the perspective
of your ideal self like this is the
whole like what would Jesus do thing
that has a lot of wisdom but more so
what would the universe do like how
would they how would it perceive the
situation and to bridge the gap between
you and the universe is the perspective
of your ideal self this is where the
symbol from my book comes into play It's
You the perspective of your ideal self
and then the perspective of the universe
so when you're going about situations
adopt the perspective of your ideal
future your ideal self what you want out
of life the goals associated with that
which we're going to break down that way
you can perceive situations from a
better lens and make a better choice
because you aren't so narrowed in on
right here and right now now and just
choosing Comfort time after time you
must allow yourself the room to discover
new goals by tossing an anchor into the
unknown so create a massive goal that
acts as a spotlight in the unknown and
you don't set this massive goal for
practicality or achievement even you're
not trying to necessarily achieve this
goal you set it for vision Direction and
filtration of opportunities focus on
making this as desirable as possible
please use a notebook and write these
down and or when it's available you can
just use this process by using the fosi
planner which is the new planner that
came out with the book it may or may not
be available yet but you can check the
link in the description or go to the
danco do store if you had all the money
in the world what would your average day
look like what kind of environment do
you want to live in is there a specific
location do you want to travel do you
want a family what do you want that life
to look like visualize an average day of
family time how long of a work day do
you want to have if you could do
anything what would you do for work how
do you want to look and feel describe
your body energy levels and how you want
to present yourself to the world what
does your ideal day look like map out
every hour list out anything else that
comes to mind in terms of a specific
future that you want to build for
yourself so to make this even more
potent turn this Vision this is your
vision for the future into an antiv
Vision that way you create this Frame or
perspective of your ideal self that way
it's complete you have two things to
bounce between you have multiple anchor
points to observe situations from so
number one is what is the bane of your
existence and then two write out the
opposite of every question about your
vision that we just went over for even
more Firepower create a vision board add
images to a scrapbook software or wall
that makes that future more tangible and
here remember that nothing is permanent
you're writing these things down you're
creating your vision for the future it's
going to change that's actually a good
thing this is how you refine and iterate
with time but you can't iterate on
something that doesn't exist you can't
improve something that doesn't exist if
you don't have a vision for the future
or a direction for your life how are you
going to course correct over time if you
don't have that if you haven't written
it down and thought about it you're not
going to make progress or that is at
least meaningful progress toward a goal
that you choose right you can make
progress all day towards the goals that
people assign to you but if you don't
have it written down and you don't
condition your mind to think in this
goal then you're going to be pursuing
other people's goals and wondering like
why do I feel stressed why do I feel
overwhelmed why do I feel all of this
 because it was assigned to you and
you just accepted it without question so
with this we're using this Vision as
filtration so you're going to say no to
every single opportunity that does not
align with your vision but this also
means for you to be realistic if you
just are like seeing an opportunity but
can't see how it connects to your goal
or how it helps you achieve that and
simply because you don't want to do it
you want to say no what I'm saying is
that you're going to also say yes to
everything that may lead to your vision
for the future which may be something
that you don't want to do right now but
you do want to do it when you zoom out
and actually have the perspective of
your ideal self so step number two is
creating a hierarchy of goals because we
have the vision for direction and
filtration but now we need to break this
down and make the path clear we need
Clarity more than we need motivation an
ordered mind is a happy one and a
hierarchy of self-generated goals makes
it hard for depressing distractions to
penetrate your awareness now break your
vision down into goals for each domain
of your life Mind Body Spirit business
relationships are synonymous with Spirit
here and yes this is going to be timec
consuming take your time this is your
future we're talking about so for all
four domains of life create 10e goals
one-year goals monthly goals and weekly
goals then every day you're going to
write down three to five priority tasks
that move the needle toward these goals
from the ground up knock these tasks out
first thing in the morning before
responsibilities and distractions have
time to wake up and I talk about the
structure of my deep work in the video
Change Your Life in 6 months my deep
work routine so step three is how to
learn because people don't know how to
learn reading books is not learning
watching tutorials is not learning you
learn by building a project and facing
reality now we need to understand that
projects are goals that you can measure
and iterate so we're going to turn a few
of your onee or monthly goals into
projects ideate a way to build something
meaningful you must do work write down
Milestones you can reach create an
outline in a Notes app or a notebook
brain dump any ideas that come to mind
or you can eventually get access to
Cortex the software I'm building where
it's a second brain that helps you
achieve your projects you want to do
this for mental physical financial and
Spiritual Development this primes your
mind for pattern recognition in other
words it helps you get more good
dopamine out of life because the things
that you are perceiving have somewhere
to go everything becomes useful in your
life every book that you read every
conversation you have when you have a
project that is outlined and you have
milestones and you have Clarity you're
going to feel the need to go into your
notes or your project or whatever and
add the inspiration that you get step
four is to understand that skills are
groups of techniques building a project
isn't the end of learning to build a
project you must acquire skills along
the way but you don't learn a skill you
learn a technique experiment with it and
continue adding techniques into until
you can combine them in a way that leads
to your desired outcome an example is
that you don't learn Photoshop as a
skill you create a project and you have
a vision for that project of what you
want to create and if you don't know how
to create it then you're going to look
up a specific technique on how to
complete one aspect of that project and
then once that's done you're going to
look up another technique to complete
another aspect of the project and so on
and so forth until you master Photoshop
watching specific tuto well watching
just just general tutorials on Photoshop
is not going to help you if you're not
building along with it because you're
not going to notice the information that
solves the problem that you're facing
because learning comes from struggle and
so with this if you've used Photoshop
you know that there are like 10 plus
techniques to just remove the background
from something like okay there's an easy
way of just removing the background from
like a human right but what about a tree
with all the details within it you're
not going to be able to do that and it's
going to take like 3 hours to do that
manually with the pen tool so you need
to learn how to use channels and then
make the layer mask with that so you're
stacking techniques so you can
eventually Master any situation that
comes because there's going to be
different nuances in the situations that
you're exposed to think about how this
applies to life and like communication
skills where yeah it's easy to say hello
how are you that's like that's like
masking or removing the background from
my person in Photoshop but then what
about doing it from trees how do you
navigate a Nuance conversation that's
going to take more techniques practiced
over time stacked until you master the
skill of social dynamics and the thing
here is that you there is absolutely no
way to do this all at once there's no
one book that can teach you all of this
all at once maybe there is and it has
the techniques but you still have to
practice each one of those techniques
over time until you achieve the goal the
same thing goes with copyrighting or any
marketing based skill you don't just
learn copywriting as the skill you
create a project like writing an email
or a landing page or a tweet and then
you study a specific technique with a
YouTube video or a book or something of
that nature you learn techniques for
capturing attention holding attention
enhancing the perceived value of your
product or idea Etc there are dozens of
techniques for each thing that you're
trying to achieve and the more you learn
the better you get with copyrighting as
a skill your first landing page is going
to suck it's going to be absolute
and that's okay that's called trial and
error so in something like 2hour writer
I have you build projects and I give you
the techniques to practice along the way
everything is a skill life is a skill
that encapsulates health wealth and
relationships as skills until broken
down into techniques you can practice
over the course of your life to master
life itself all skills are mental skills
are mental systems that become more
efficient with practice to achieve your
desired outcome step five is to reinvent
yourself think of your mind as the
digestive system of reality this alone
can point you towards what you're
supposed to be doing if you feel
overwhelmed or you feel like you're not
learning anything or you like are trying
to read a book but you haven't retained
any of the information it's because
you're not stopping and digesting the
information with practice and building
you need to like pull back from
consuming at this point and just build
with the knowledge you have and refer to
the material you've used before when I'm
writing notes in cortex my software I
have to read books extremely slow just
because I'm digesting a page at a time
and really trying to dissect and
understand it and this has helped my
articulation and communication and
newsletters and YouTube videos and
content so much because I start to
deeply understand the information so
when you think about this as like with
your actual digestive system when you
eat just enough you create an
environment that is conducive to muscle
growth You Trek through reality towards
your goals you enter a season of pure
progress and the feeling is incredible
when you eat too much you feel like crap
a lot of people that go on hard bulks
they just feel terrible the entire time
and if you don't eat enough then you're
not giving your body or business
business enough of the resources to
build what is necessary so you go
through Cycles you get you eat too much
or you bulk and then you cut and then
you maintain and like you have to think
of life through these Universal patterns
adopt the perspective of the universe
because you need to zoom out and go meta
on what's actually happening in your
situation and stop trying to find all
these little like tactics to solve it
like oh I feel like crap what's this
little technique I can do to solve it in
an instant when it's a part of life and
you need to understand life life is the
mental model model with a vision goals
and projects you are primed for an
entirely new life all you have to do is
take the leap launch yourself into a new
physical or digital environment move
across the country unfollow everyone
online follow people aligned with your
future change what you wear where you
shop and who you see Drown Your Mind in
the books you've been putting off
reading changing what you wear is
actually a very big one I see people
lock themselves into specific identities
just by choosing what they want to wear
so with this you want to align all
information or align reality with who
you want to become you will feel
threatened at the start because you are
trying to expand your identity and your
identity wants to survive who it is it's
going to be painful your old identity
will die because it is starved of the
information that reinforces it hold
strong during this extremely difficult
yet extremely meaningful turning point
in your life step six is Nature's
Compass people are so afraid of making
mistakes that they make the biggest
mistake of them all not making mistakes
you can't avoid making making mistakes
they are nature's Compass people who
don't make mistakes don't give
themselves a chance to achieve successes
so imagine a self-driving car for years
it has received negative feedback that
refines the system that shapes the mind
of the car I watched a video from Elon
Musk yesterday on Optimus the little
robot that he's building that will
probably fill most people's homes and
just be their personal assistant and do
things for them like wash the laundry
and way more beyond that there's a lot
more utility in actually having a
personal robot
but this was the third iteration in a
year of what he's been doing because you
have to fix the bugs in the system you
have to fix the bugs in your life you
have to be okay with mistakes like you
when you were born were like the minimum
viable product and you've been improving
most people people have been degrading
the entire time and I'm not talking
about physically here I'm talking about
mentally the systems that compose your
mind so the car now a Tesla can navigate
the roads with ease simply because it's
had so much feedback machine learning
like it's learned and I would argue that
it is and will be safer than most humans
driving a car because it doesn't have
those like negative thoughts or
distractions going through its mind it's
just like I'm going to acheve I'm a
system to achieve this goal and that's
what opens up room for humans to just
continue performing creative tasks and
pushing forward in technology and
evolution I'm talking about this in the
next video the future of work is play
you must act in alignment with your big
goal to form new systems that your mind
operates on through through the negative
feedback of mistakes make a habit of
forcing yourself to adopt the
perspective of the highest version of
yourself allow this lens to unveil new
opportunities that you can act on when
you make a mistake because you will use
it as direction for your next choice
with time you won't even realize that
you have become an artist in whatever
skill you've chosen to develop you will
be able to achieve what most people
think are difficult goals like you are
able to walk While most are still
crawling step seven is
self-experimentation solves your problem
problems for good your life is a project
and the projects that compose your life
should be treated as science projects to
solve the problems that achieve your
goal hypothesize an outcome from your
goals experiment with techniques for
skill acquisition document the process
as a project and double down on results
as a solution now you have experience
skills and projects that you can turn
into a business you have a solution to a
problem that you can charge money for in
the Creator economy this is what I talk
about all the time in my one person
business Bus videos and my digital
writer videos of solve your own problems
and sell the solution if you just
improved yourself and achieved goals
then you help other people achieve the
goals you help Humanity evolve by just
solving your own problems and selling
the solution it's how you earn an income
doing what you enjoy I discussed this in
the last video actually on the anti-
niche so let's say you have the goal of
achieving a six-pack you are in search
of a solution and they tell you that
veganism will solve all of your problems
and from an unlighted State you clean up
your diet follow their advice as if it
were law see the results they mentioned
then you'll attach to that diet ideology
as if it is the best way to get a
sixpack or be healthy or be fit because
that one ideology or technique that they
gave you was just a way to generate
Clarity and that's why you felt good is
because you had Clarity on how to
achieve your goals so in reality what
happened when you switched to veganism
and I'm not only talking about veganism
here I'm talking about any fad diet that
people fad diet or Diet in general that
people adopt and don't treat as lens
that they can take off and put on they
attach to it it becomes their identity
but what really happened is that you ate
more nutrient-dense Foods your actions
work to survive your vegan identity and
you had Clarity not chaos by following a
disciplined nutrition regimen you didn't
have as many options you didn't have as
many choices you add rules to a game
that you were playing and games are fun
to play that's the entire purpose of
creating a hierarchy of goals and
remaining open-minded on how to achieve
those goals is because you have rules or
limits that frame your attention
eliminate distractions and make it
easier to actually achieve those goals
now if you were to try veganism for a
month and then go carnivore for a month
and then keto for a month and then try
flexible dieting for a month you would
make connections between the diets to
reveal the fundamentals of Health
pattern recognition equals dopamine here
you would pick and choose certain
methodologies that you enjoy meaning
they will bring sustainable results and
you will refine A system that fits your
individual nature to Perfection then
once Healthy Living becomes effortless
you can do the same for your finances
social life romantic relationships
spiritual Endeavors and any other domain
of life if you're going through problems
in your relationship there's multiple
things you can experiment with to solve
the problem but just choosing and
identifying with one that may or may not
get the results that you want or you
know are available to you that's a bad
thing because you can hire a therapist
watch a YouTube guru go on a retreat and
experiment with options until you find
the right solution and if your business
isn't growing you can buy a course you
can hire a coach you can test a new
software or you just zoom out you allow
yourself to discover new goals by
adopting the perspective Ive of life or
the universe or the ideal version of
yourself there's always a way to solve
your problems and you strip yourself of
that power when you latch on to one
solution that probably won't solve the
problem for good think of each domain of
life as both a project and a skill in
which you collect techniques to master
that domain okay that was long so let's
summarize what the Mastery method is one
expand your mind with a vision
generation session this perspective will
allow you to create new goals and
discover new potentials for your life so
you can break out of your narrow mind
and achieve more two is create a
hierarchy of goals to bring Clarity to
your life you need to bridge the gap
between where you are now and where you
want to be with practical goals three is
turn your goals into projects so you can
build and learn in unison projects are
goals that are measured tracked and
improved four is don't learn skills
acquire techniques your skill level
depends on the amount of techniques in
your toolbox that can solve challenging
problems number five is reinvent
yourself with information overload
change your physical and digital
environments to force an open mind and
discovery of new potentials six is treat
mistakes as negative feedback in your
system you have no other way to test
something that gets better results seven
is treat your life as a science project
become obsessed with experimentation in
