early last year I came across an
American philosopher that was touted to
be the most conscious man alive this
guy's name is Ken Wilbur and since then
I picked up a few books from him
including a brief history of everything
and Cosmic Consciousness and a few
others I've skimmed through him and I
was instantly hooked he his teachings on
holism Consciousness in general and just
his integral Theory really made a lot of
philosophical Concepts click for me and
as I researched more I found uh
something interesting many of you know
David data the author of The Way of the
superior man and Mark Manson who is the
author of The subtle art of not giving a
 so both of them were former
students of Ken Wilbur and David data
clearly went on to use what he learned
to help explain uh modern sexuality and
masculinity in his books and Mark Manson
had a more interesting story where he
saw the rise and fall of Ken Wilbur I
read on uh his blog you can probably
find it somewhere it's called the rise
and fall of Ken Wilbur but uh Mark
Manson was an adamant student of his he
was really loving what he was learning
he was supposed to go to some seminar or
workshop and out of nowhere Ken Wilbur
kind of turned on his audience he said
some weird questionable things and then
he kind of just disappeared from the
scene and the long long story short of
Mark Manson's article on this is that
even the most conscious beings are still
human we still have egos and so Ken is
now back in Action he's showing up up on
some Niche podcast I would recommend you
go and give some of them a listen
because they are very intriguing then I
feel like if you like my content you'll
like theirs quite a bit it's a lot more
stimulating than mine is just because I
haven't reached that level of thought or
articulation yet and even though Ken
Wilbur did make some questionable
remarks and he turned on his audience
there's still a lot that we can learn
from him it's the same same thing with
Alan Watts where uh like Alan Watts many
of you know of him but some of you don't
know that he died or he was a victim of
alcoholism right so he drank alcohol and
a lot of people have uh different
perceptions and perspectives around
alcohol but the the point is is that the
medium and the message are separate and
that even spiritual people are human too
and they have their vices and they're
battling with them and in my opinion
Alan Watts's alcohol problem still
aligned with his philosophy and so
without going too deep into this I would
encourage you to research these things
for yourself follow your curiosity and
question things don't form hard set
beliefs on these things that most people
would label as bad because we live in a
world of Relativity and there are no
absolutes except for the absolute and so
the purpose of me framing this entire
video this way is that I want to
introduce you to a concept of Ken Wilbur
and what he calls a hollon HR o l o n a
hollon is the unit of everything it is
both a part and it is a whole like how
an atom is a hole in itself but it is
also a part of a molecule or how the
molecule is a hole but it is also a part
of the cell and then going all the way
up about humans and how they are holes
in themselves but they are also a part
of society Society a whole part of a
culture culture a whole part of a Nation
Nation world world galaxy galaxy galaxy
Cosmos Cosmos
God and so they span in infinite
directions and this really helps paint a
picture of what some people call
relativism or relativity where
everything is connected right everything
the thing that joins these hollons
together is relationships so as Alan
Watts would say existence is
relationship and you are smack in the
middle of it because humans are not only
a part of society but I'm a part of this
room I'm a part of a family I'm a part
of friendships Uh Wood is not only a
part of a tree it is part of a chair it
is used to build houses and so we can
start to paint a picture here that
Hollands or really anything ideas
figments of Consciousness units of
thought is what Alan Watts would call
them these are the building blocks of
creative problem solving and this is not
only limited to things that are material
or tangible ideas are also Hollands
thoughts emotions they are Hollands they
are part of a whole and a hole in
themselves and this is how humans make
sense of the world we create limits or
distinctions in the this case they're
called holdons and how these
distinctions work together and how
they're very context dependent or goal
dependent and they're very useful when
you start to actually notice these
distinctions or hold-ons like with an
emotion how can you follow that
relationship to its source and
understand it on a deeper level so that
you can overcome that emotion if it's
like a negative one and so this is best
understood through philosophical
contemplation just letting thoughts
trigger thoughts and going down a rabbit
hole of curiosity and Discovery so this
is a practice that you can do on your
own but we can do one right now let's
say the whole on that I want to choose
is honey so if I want to dissect that or
just understand it on a deeper bigger
picture level I can use my mind to
follow it so there's the process of
making honey the bees associated with
pollination the beekeepers and if
they're making a living wage whether any
harm is being done to the bees the
manufacturing and distribution process
of the honey how the honey impacts human
health when consumed and onward toward
Infinity you can take any single one of
those words in that list even the bullet
points themselves and just start
connecting dots and so in business as an
example the one person business that we
talk about you are a whole that includes
your interests your interests are part
and a whole of you but they are also a
part in a whole of your Niche and then
your Niche is a part in the whole of the
market and then markets are kind of
parts and holes of social media and so
if you're struggling in any domain of
life that usually means there's a
problem right that you're struggling
through and you can usually pinpoint
that problem and you can start to zoom
out and see the bigger picture of how it
connects with other things and so this
is why multi-perspectival understanding
and open-mindedness is so important is
because it allows you to solve creative
Problems by connecting the dots this is
something we're going to go a lot more
in depth into in the next video which is
going to be called like the greatest
trap of the 21st century which is
closed-mindedness cheap dopamine
distraction Etc so now let's get into
the interesting stuff which is modern
enslavement or society as a pyramid
scheme nobody I want to be trained into
a job I hate work for 40 years and get
angry at a TV until I die ninety percent
of the population does exactly that wake
up it's not too late so notice how
hollons are hierarchical they transcend
and include one another like how humans
or the emergence and and they emerge as
well right so something emerges and then
it transcends and includes what is under
it so a human for example transcended
and includes animals right we include
the physicality and survival nature kind
of in a metaphorical sense the
physicality yes but the the survival is
conceptual in our case of course we have
physical survival but we also
include conceptual survival and spirit
emerged right that is the main
difference is is Spirit emerged and
humans have the ability to uh sense it
which is pretty much the connection of
Minds through the intangible like how a
sports team has team spirit and they
share that Spirit or energy uh going
into a game and it allows them to win
like if they have low Spirit low team
spirit and another team has high team
spirit you'd be surprised in how much
the game can be swayed in any direction
of winning or losing so everything is
structured as a hierarchy and there are
two types
the first are Dominator hierarchies
which is what gives the word hierarchy a
bad reputation so these consist of
pyramid scheme-esque structures then the
second are natural hierarchies or
actualization hierarchies which is in
order of increasing wholeness such as
particles to atoms to cells to organisms
or letters to words to sentences to
paragraphs the whole on one level
becomes a part of the whole of the next
so you can see the wisdom in how Society
kind of mimics this hierarchical
structure but society would fall under
the definition of a dominator hierarchy
and of course this is context dependent
but in like when we think of society
this is what we think about and so
societal entities like public schools or
or the parts that make up the whole of
society like public schools government
corporate jobs and even some religious
institutions which is more culture but
still part and a whole those are also
structured in this way so it's a higher
hierarchies within hierarchies and the
main thing with this is that there are
more people with less power at the
bottom and then there are less people
with more power at the top and so in a
true pyramid scheme there are investors
at the bottom that enable this power
distribution so you climb this ladder in
any given situation if you're trying to
climb the ladder like some people aren't
trying to climb like the religious
ladder right A lot of people aren't
trying to become pastors but in in the
sake of like a corporate job or going to
school you you're taught to climb the
ladder through hard work and usually
manual labor just hard hard work but
it's going to be close to impossible to
reach the actual top of the pyramid if
you go about it this way you're usually
going to get stuck in one level because
if there's 10 people at the top and a
million people at the bottom
how are you those are just bad odds and
so the people that want to break out of
this pyramid scheme as structure have to
create their own right they have to
start their own business they have to
start their own actualization hierarchy
or create their own actualization
hierarchy to escape a dominance
hierarchy because the thing with this is
that these are created every single day
right they transcend and include after
creative emergence and so in in these
pyramid schemes yeah money plays a role
but money isn't the biggest problem the
people at the bottom of the societal
pyramid schemes are not investing money
some of them are but they're investing
attention so since humans survive on a
conceptual level and if you identify or
you like all that you know and all that
you believe is let's say the job title
that you adopt you're going to work to
survive that identity with your
attention right like for example it
doesn't exist unless there is enough
attention to give it life so in the case
of like religious ideology or a business
model like there could be a business
model out there that we have no clue
about because no one has actually done
it or spread the word so that there is
attention given to that business model
to make it seem like it exists and it is
something tangible that other people can
go into but when people identify with
their job title or their religion or
something else it is upheld through
attention and if that attention is
threatened like if if the attention is
threatened then the existence of that
thing is threatened and you are going to
feel threatened like if someone says oh
I don't like your sports team and you
get threatened like you actually have a
physical survival response is what I'm
saying here that is what I mean and
you're going to defend that belief over
and over and hardwire it into your brain
when in reality if you just zoom out
gain a bigger picture your those
problems mean absolutely all so
it's safe to say that power in our
modern world comes from attention we're
talking about external power but we're
also talking about internal power so
being able to actually control your own
attention and so another pattern to note
here that we've talked about before is
that these hierarchical structures also
present a hierarchy of goals that help
frame our attention or focus our
attention or order our mind and with
just a world of overwhelm uncertainty
and like insecurity the masses flock to
the thing that is going to be most
likely to heal that uncertainty or order
their mind which is usually one of these
external hierarchy of goals like
climbing the corporate ladder because
they don't have Clarity on anything else
they can do they haven't been exposed to
another potential path that makes sense
and have been given Clarity on how to
actually reach that goal and take action
on it so they either believe it's
impossible or it's just not a
possibility for them and so they go to
the thing that has just been ingrained
in our minds of what we should do and
focus our attention on throughout the
entirety of our lives and so this is the
definition of modern enslavement I don't
believe that like someone at the top is
just planning being a puppet master I
just it's it's just
human nature and how nature is
structured in this hierarchical manner
and how we plan to focus our attention
and over time these things becoming more
and more normalized or conditioned into
our brains to the point where we are
born as slaves unless we take it on
ourselves to free or break those chains
because social conditioning since the
day you were born Narrows your mind to
see the world the same as everyone else
people have to be on the same page and
so it becomes automatic for us to invest
our psychic or mental energy into these
hierarchy of goals not only to help
maintain them because all in all if
Society collapses then we all collapse
it's not just going to collapse out of
nowhere but you see what I mean is that
it's like well someone has to do this
job someone has to do this it's like
that this is what creative problem
solving is for if people actually woke
up and wanted to create a better future
for themselves and they decide not to go
the traditional route then they're going
going to have to solve a problem and if
enough people do this then the universe
will correct itself we may go through
some bad times but from a universal
perspective when you look down that
doesn't really matter it's just a part
of the process of Life birth and death
the collective societal vision for your
future is to get good grades maybe get a
high-paying job watch TV to ease your
mind and maybe retire happily at 65.
both with the unconscious seeking of
status survival and approval and So
eventually with the social conditioning
or just conditioning in general all of
this stuff becomes habit and we go on to
mimic others right we become a product
of others and we Chase these status
games we spend our money on the fancy
cars we invest our attention all day to
make that money back and we never think
to consult or create and then consult
our own values Vision wants needs and
potential impact on the world so we
escape this modern enslavement one by
becoming aware which I'm making you
aware of right now and then the second
thing is by creating your own
actualization heart hierarchy to order
your mind and create a better future for
yourself and those around you because of
actualization hierarchy will present a
series of goals which are problems and
increasing in creativity along the way
and fulfillment and impact along the way
that will potentially spread to other
people throughout the world so you have
to work your way up and those the goals
imply problems solve the problems over
and over again and that is what you
invest your attention in to help not
only change your own life but then let
that go on to impact other people as a
whole and so you can opt for doing
nothing you really can you can be a
sheep you can be an NPC whatever however
people label it you can opt for doing
nothing but you have to understand that
you are a human and that you are not
going to escape survival if you opt for
doing nothing you are automatically a
slave you don't have to tie a negative
connotation with slave right that's not
necessarily a bad thing in certain cases
it can be it can't be just don't take
what I'm saying as absolutely literal in
the the same interpretation that
everyone is going to have like a slave
from a thousand years ago we're talking
metaphorically here in terms of the mind
not physicality so I've been working on
this for a long time this is going to be
called the focus formula and it is how
you take back control of your life so
let's look at the graphic I made for
this one I'm proud of this one but we'll
dive into all of these steps right now
just screenshot this if you want to have
a way of remembering what we're going to
talk about right now if you don't know
what you want you will be told what you
want and you will believe it so unless
you have dissolved your ego completely
entirely it doesn't exist and you plan
to live out in the woods like a monk
with no human connection whatsoever then
you're going to need a purpose and even
then
humans still have a purpose your purpose
then is peace and you are just
doing that so since success is relative
and dependent on a hierarchy of goals
you need to create your own so let's
create the structure to order our minds
and create a good life for ourselves so
the first thing we have to talk about is
purpose and the reason I'm creating this
mainly and a lot of why I do what I do
is because Mo what most people say in
books and stuff it just doesn't really
make sense right it doesn't make too
much sense when people say oh you need a
purpose there's no like how how do I
find my purpose or something like that
or uh like you understand what a purpose
is but you don't really understand what
it is you know what I'm saying so for
the sake of Simplicity purpose one there
is not only one purpose you don't have
one purpose right so there are lesser
and greater purposes and you have to you
have to achieve one purpose in order to
unlock the next so to make this as
simple as possible a purpose is a goal
and a goal introduces a problem and so
your purpose
the most pressing problem in your life
right now if you have done absolutely
nothing with your life your purpose is
not to spread love and be selfless and
good to the other to the world that it
just doesn't work that way if you
haven't self-developed and
self-transcended then it's impossible to
be truly absolutely selfless so sit back
and think what is your purpose right now
what is the problem or the pain that you
have been avoiding confronting if you're
overweight and you need more energy and
that's really dampening your life right
like you can't walk downstairs you can't
walk and keep up with your friends uh
you can't even work a job like specific
jobs in order to make more money then
that is your purpose and you need to
laser all of your attention in on that
and solve it with what we're going to
talk next but that is the thing that is
your main goal that is your North Star
at the moment and all of your actions
will be aligned with that whether it be
food you eat or just the choices you
make whether you go on a walk or you sit
on a couch and the thing with this is
that you really have to sit and
understand how that problem or pain is
spreading into the rest of your life you
have to become conscious of that in
order to get absolutely fed up with
where you are and then that energy that
purpose will be much easier to one it
will fuel you in the morning and you
want to get out of bed but you have to
get to that point you have to sit with
it and marinate in it and stop ignoring
the pain in your life or just another
example is like mine I don't know if
this was my first purpose but I as a kid
I feel like a lot of you can relate I
was just tired of not being able to get
girls even though I wasn't trying right
that's like every young dudes thing is
you want to get girls and so my first
thought like when I went through my
first breakup it's like okay I'm gonna
get back at her for and just go to the
gym and get jacked right and so that's
why I went to the gym is because the
biggest pain in my life as a kid it's
funny now thinking back on your past
purposes but that was the thing is I
went to the gym because there was a big
pain in my life and I wanted to solve
that and the thing with this is is
that's a lesser purpose but once you
start solving that and once you do
eventually solve that just with time
it's not even immediate you may not know
if it's solved or not then the next
purpose presents itself because you're
just slowly and consistently solving
better problems for yourself so remember
this is that one problems don't ever go
away they just get better and they get
more fun to solve right that's all we're
doing that's all we're doing here is
we're just constantly solving problems
or avoiding problems and that's the
cause of pain so we're either leaning
into the battle the conflict the problem
or we're sitting back and we're
marinating in it and we're just not
moving or aside from those two we are in
the present moment or we are meditating
and we are practicing and getting ready
for that next round of heat which is
problem solving life unfolds in chapters
like a book and each chapter presents a
purpose that the next chapter leads into
and you will feel lost heading into new
chapters of your life your purpose isn't
just going to be readily available
during the next like after you solve the
first one or after you completed the
first purpose the next one isn't going
to show up you're going to feel lost
we've all gone through this and it's
normal you just have to sit with it and
this is a time where you would practice
presence mindfulness and other things in
preparation for that next round of
intensity so if you aren't making
progress then you are preparing for the
next round of making progress and you
have to be okay with that and you have
to sit with it and self-reflect to
understand okay what like getting hints
at your next purpose it's like pieces of
the puzzle right because you only know
you don't exactly like know what a
problem is right away maybe bugging you
for a bit and you don't know what it is
unless you self-reflect on what went
wrong and what went right in your life
it's like I may not know where I want to
move next but if I reflect on my past
and think about the places that I've
been on vacation to or I've gone and
visited and I can get a little inkling
of like okay I want to live in a place
that's a big city I want to be able to
walk in some places this is how you
create a vision for your future as you
reflect and you start to piece together
pieces of the puzzle based on your past
mistakes and based on what went well so
from your mistakes you understand okay I
don't want to make that mistake again
and you can move in a better Direction
like if I blow a bunch of money on a
compulsive purchase like a car and then
I can't afford anything for like three
months that was a mistake and then it
also presents a problem that could
potentially be your next purpose or
something that you need to solve right
so if I can't afford the lifestyle that
I want to live then I need to make more
money so I need to start a business
right I need to do or I need to increase
my skill set in order to get a better
job right it allows me to make prog
address on something that I want and can
be enjoyable if I have Clarity on how to
do it and so if I start a business or I
and then those present subsequent
problems and then you have to solve
those you have to lean into them if I
don't know how to build a business that
I need to learn if I know and I haven't
done anything then I need to act like
all of this stuff is so simple if you
just get out of your head and understand
here's a problem I need to solve it I
need to also learn how to solve it and
then I'm going to solve it and so the
next time around that like there are no
right or wrong actions here right where
if I want to do something so surface
level so status based like starting a
business making a lot of money and
getting a good car then I'm going to do
that but then I have to self-reflect and
see if that was a mistake because I can
always come back and correct it I can
sell the car I can make a better
decision I can restructure my business I
can restructure My Lifestyle I just need
the control to do that and if you aren't
able to do that then that's a problem
solve it if you have a job and you don't
have any time on your hands that's a
problem start a business do what you
have to do and so if you're absolutely
lost you're just absolutely lost with
this whole purpose stuff then you need
to ask better questions to yourself
because questions dictate the quality of
answers quality of answers dictate the
quality of your life and so use these
questions below as attention anchors
right hold them in the back of your
awareness because these answer these
questions aren't answered with time I
don't think any questions are answered
almost immediately at least meaningful
ones where you actually gain knowledge
because you have to make mistakes and
let struggle and pain lead to answers so
ask the questions to yourself as we go
about them and then experience life
self-reflect and see okay in alignment
with these questions what answers are
starting to piece together from what I
just experienced in life what do I
really want out of life what is
important to me what is the highest
version of myself what does my ideal day
look like what do I have to accomplish
in order to get there does that solve a
problem in the world and what product or
service aligns with both what is the
next phase of my purpose
write these down so after purpose we
have process we need to gain Clarity and
understand how to achieve whatever
purpose we have repeat the boring
fundamentals that's how you get results
but realize they aren't boring a sushi
chef spends years perfecting the
preparation of rice a tennis player
obsesses over the angle of their serve
Mastery sets you apart in a world that
can't see beyond the surface so what is
the process that is going to allow you
to achieve your goal so every goal is
you if it's not like immediate like me
saying this next word as a goal if it's
further away from you then you need to
gain Clarity by attaching a string of
goals to it like a quest in a video game
that helps narrow your attention block
distractions and gets you obsessed with
solving it it gives you Clarity it
orders your mind and so from those
deconstructed goals from your purpose
let's say my purpose is I need to just
get fit in the gym then what's the
process goal number one is I need to
learn how to go to the gym goal number
two is I need to understand what I
actually need to do do what food do I
need to eat what equipment do I need to
buy and if my goal is specific right
which we'll talk about in a bit like
gaining 20 pounds of muscle in my first
year right I have to learn in order to
understand and gain Clarity on that goal
and understand what's actually possible
and then align all of my actions with
that goal and execute as a process
repeating the boring fundamentals so you
need to study the principles of these
things in order to actualize or achieve
your goals and so you also have to
understand that this process is going to
change with time and as you learn and
experience more because the process of
Mastery or just anything like acquiring
a skill it comes in stages of beginner
intermediate Advanced and possibly even
more in between that like a beginner in
the gym is not going to be doing the
same workouts as an intermediate or an
advanced lifter in the gym same as with
business you're not going to be hiring
employees as a beginner you're going to
be acquiring skills learning direct
Outreach learning Direct response
marketing understanding how to grow on
social media understanding what you want
to talk about creating your Niche etc
etc and then intermediate is more so
like maintaining that we talked about
stage one through three creators in the
one person business roadmap so that's an
example but you see what I'm saying here
and so every stage will have its own
lever moving actions that you need to
take on a daily basis in order to
bust through your purpose and if you
need help with this use my power planner
it's free download in the description
it'll help you take your vision for the
future break it down into yearly monthly
weekly and daily goals with priority
tasks and that's what we're talking
about next is priority making better
decisions so the best way to frame your
actions whether it be on a daily or even
like a higher goal like a monthly goal
is performance versus vanity so we're
favoring performance here so instead of
trying to gain uh 50 followers a day
which if you've been in the social media
game you know that as a beginner that's
kind of like iffy like it's it's not
guaranteed right you don't have control
over it so your mind is much more likely
to become disordered and overwhelmed and
anxious about actually taking action so
what you can do instead of trying to
gain 50 followers is writing 1000 words
a day and of course this has to be
aligned with what you're actually doing
or it can be right three high quality
tweets a day or one Instagram post a day
and 20 replies under an account to get
more followers to your actual page and
so this is such such a big realization
is that you at this moment in your life
are meant manifestation of your past
choices all of them have compounded into
who you are today and your future self
is going to be a manifestation of the
choices you make from this moment on
until then and so making better
decisions comes much easier when you
have a purpose and process to frame your
attention into and make decisions in
alignment with so the first thing you do
to start making better decisions is to
bring your purpose to the top of your
mind this will help you filter signal
importance from noise distraction so if
it isn't conducive to achieving your
purpose then it isn't important unless
you've been convinced that it is by
someone else so the next thing you can
do for making better decisions is
gaining multi-perspectival understand
standing so you can do this in many
different ways and we've talked about
this before and we'll talk about it more
in the next video but for the sake of
brevity because this video is already
getting really long is to adopt the
perspective of the highest version of
yourself right what do they look like
what do they want to do with their life
you have to have a vision for your
future and you have to adopt the
perspective of that person you have to
transfer your Consciousness into that
person and see what decision would they
make like if I'm a bodybuilder I can
pretty much understand why a bodybuilder
would decide to eat chicken and rice
aside from going out it's because they
have a goal to achieve a meaningful goal
to achieve a purpose so how can you view
the situation that allows you to
perceive it in a way that is conducive
to action and that's the thing is to
perceive a situation in a way that
allows you to act in alignment with your
purpose problems are only problems if
you interpret them as such from your
narrow perspective if you don't feel
like getting out of bed zoom out and see
your problem for what it is there's some
people that don't have legs they have to
be let out of bed are you like they
don't give a if you don't feel like
getting out of bed they can't even get
out of bed there are people that don't
even have a bed or food to cook and eat
in the morning so you have a purpose to
actualize and you need to perceive the
situation in the way that allows you to
act to actually actualize it so do that
so a note about this the the Focus
Formula the little graphic there that we
created is that this does not only apply
to your life this applies to every
single goal you plan to actualize if
you're working on a project right or
you're writing an article it's the same
thing you need a purpose for that
article you need a process for writing
it and you need priority actions to take
this is like a global framework for
framing your attention and eliminating
distractions and not having all of these
problems that are unimportant their
noise distract you from what's important
in your life and actually impacting the
world on a deeper level so this is that
image is your reality okay you need to
internalize that and you need to sit
with it and marinate in it and
understand the good and bad of not
achieving it you have to understand what
is going to happen if I do not achieve
this purpose and it's not pretty at all
observe just just sit and follow rabbit
hole into the worst possible scenario of
where your life could end up and then
also do the opposite the flip side of
the coin what is the best case scenario
of if you actually actualize this
purpose and then the next and then the
next and then the next what will happen
where will you be in life and then dance
between those two as you're going about
life and if something else pops up to
try and distract you then you need to
sit with it and you need to filter it
through a purpose filter and understand
okay is this important and how am I
going to act according to this problem
that just showed up and so typical
distractions like social media the news
and other things they don't
matter in your life and the reason they
matter to a lot of people and they base
their identity around that is because
they do not have a purpose to bring
their attention back to they do not have
a hierarchy of goals to frame and
structure their attention to create a
better life for themselves so that is it
