hey bro you need to become high value If
This Were a social media post it would
go viral I've seen it happen a ton of
times I've written tweets similar to
this I've made social media posts about
becoming a high value individual but if
I were to ask you what high value means
what valuable means would you be able to
tell me is it about acquiring a certain
amount of marketable skills is it about
how you combine those skills is it the
result of the other person receiving
those skills and how it impacts what
you're actually doing for them is it a
result of how you look to be perceived
as a high value individual is it your
personality what is it what about the
value of a Ferrari is it any more
valuable than a Kia Soul to the next
person who loves their Kia Soul what
about the value of a human being is it
as valuable as an NFL cheerleader
compare her to the person that you just
crossed by on the road without looking
twice you see I don't think anybody
knows the real
answer to the question of what is value
it makes intuitive sense of what value
is
but in a world where we have to become
high-value individuals with high value
skill sets and deliver value to other
people in order to make it we should
understand what we are actually doing
what value actually is to the point of
being able to create it and I haven't
seen many if any people bring value to
the word value so let's answer this
question what is value in your brain the
down world is managed by a handful of
chemicals neurotransmitters they're
called that let you experience
satisfaction and enjoy whatever you have
in the here and now but when you turn
your attention to the world of up your
brain relies on a different chemical a
single molecule that not only allows you
to move beyond the realm of what's at
your fingertips but also motivates you
to pursue to control and to possess the
world beyond your immediate grasp it
drives you to seek out those things far
away both physical things and the thing
things you cannot see such as knowledge
love and power that is a quote from the
book The molecule of more so dopamine
plays a huge role in how we perceive
value or at least what catches our
attention first so if you're interested
in learning about what dopamine really
is I would encourage you to read that
book the molecule of more so from a
psychological standpoint or even a
cultural or societal perspective value
is determined by dopamine no because we
would like to think that we spend our
time doing valuable things or at least
reading valuable information or seeing
valuable information right because we're
on social media we're seeing all the the
hot women the fancy cars the mansions
and that is so far away from us remember
from the quote the up world something
that is out of our control that we want
to take control of and possess and with
us as human human beings being beings of
conditioning that is the more things
that are repeated over time the more we
value it or the more that it becomes a
part of our own reality we are
culturally and societally conditioned to
have a specific Viewpoint or point of
view of the world right you are not
living maybe you are I am not living in
a third world country where I have the
perspective of certain things holding
more value than where I am right now
something like
um rice isn't as valuable as something
like a car to me but to someone else
rice is going to be much more practical
and give them a lot more benefits and
hold much more value than let's say a
car and so I think this is a big problem
because especially in the west or even
in many places like Europe or really uh
with most people that have a Wi-Fi
connection we are conditioned into you
believing that these things like fancy
cars and mansions and all of this
expensive
stuff that is shiny on the outside holds
a lot of value and that is something
that we continue to desire and want
because dopamine is the desired molecule
it is something that is away from you so
here is a graphic on the psychology of
Desire so in the circle that is black or
just an outline that is you and then the
white circle is a valuable object or
something that is perceived as valuable
and then the line in between shows you
how far away that thing is from you so
when it is close to you and especially
once you have taken control or possessed
that thing then it loses its shine it
the dopamine response drains really
quickly or it goes down very quickly you
have to switch to the down chemicals the
ones that cause appreciation and those
are like uh oxytocin serotonin
neuropanephrine there's a bunch of
different ones that play a role in the
down Network right this is what
spiritual gurus talk about when they're
talking about the present moment and
finding appreciation in the now those
are the neurotransmitters that are
evolved and those are much more
sustainable to develop appreciation for
the things that you have rather than the
things that you don't so back to the
graphic the further something away is
from you the more it's going to the more
of a dopamine response there is
and the more you can tap into that
dopamine response right you can look at
social media at something that is way
way way there's such a huge gap between
you and it like you right now driving a
Toyota Corolla and you in the future
wanting to Desiring to drive a Ferrari
and the Gap there is what causes
overwhelm right you can use that
dopamine for fuel dopamine is not bad
it's only abused in this technological
world right we evolve to use dopamine
for novelty anticipation and other
things so let's say when a one of our
ancestors was crossing by a bush right
they're conditioned to see a bush as not
a part of their survival it's just an
average Bush an ordinary Bush and then
one day they Cross by it and they see
berries right there's berries on there
now that registers in their awareness
they get that hit of dopamine because
it's new novelty is also a part of this
entire process and so for our survival
we would notice that and we would
register it and it would cause
excitement and it would give us a
feeling of oh okay I need to actually
know this I need to understand this and
I need to act on this but that's just
the thing we figured out what was
necessary for our survival and then if
those bushes kept producing those
berries then it would become normal to
us right we would have to switch to a
new mode and it's not like we got
addicted to seeing uh new new berries
grow on bushes here and there but with
all of this novelty crossing our screen
every single day with New Perspectives
uh new information that we need to act
on because there's so many opportunities
in terms of making money or just meeting
new people or just whatever it is
whatever opportunities for that present
themselves but then there's also people
that are flexing a certain lifestyle
that we really desire but it is so far
away from us that that can just send us
into this downward spiral Spiral of
overwhelm and anxiety because of that
Gap right we don't know we don't have a
plan or path to actually bridge that Gap
and take that dopamine to use as fuel to
act in the now with passion and
excitement towards let's say our vision
for the future this is why I'm so big on
creating a vision for your future is
because of the dopamine response right
you have this neurochemical cocktail in
your head of what people call passion
for their work because they have a
vision of what they are trying to
actualize in the now and all of these
different neurotransmitters are going
crazy in your brain
to help you bridge that Gap because you
have a desired outcome Clarity on how to
get there with a plan and deconstructed
goals reverse engineered from that
vision and priority tasks that you know
are going to allow you to hit those
goals if you do them day after day after
day and they become they become
conditioned and structured into your
routine now this also crosses over with
psychic entropy which we've talked about
a few times which pretty much means
everything tends toward disorder your
mind tends toward disorder if you do not
maintain the order in your mind with
vision goals priorities and reminding
and acting on them daily then your mind
is going to tend toward disorder if you
don't do it for a week you're going to
be overwhelmed and anxious and you're
going to wonder why you aren't seeing
results it's because you stop doing the
things that got results in the first
place and you don't have that momentum
built up anymore if you want to master
marketing master perception a better
product will always lose to a product
that people think is better marketers
know this well they are dopamine dealers
content creators are dopamine dealers
all of those headlines are meant to
capture attention which we will get into
in a bit but you have to understand that
a lot of what we see is misperceived or
people can polish things up on the
outside like a social media influencer
or a headline for an article or even a
title for a YouTube video to catch your
attention with something that is new and
novel and excites you or just makes you
wonder okay what's like what is this
what do I not have what is something
that I can have that will make my life
better and so people on the internet
understand this well but so do Average
Joes that are going to go to the club on
let's say a Saturday night right they
put on their best floral shirt they
slick their hair back they maybe put on
a watch they put on their favorite
perfume that was Mark created to help
you get more girls and so they
understand the game but there may be
something missing there right it's
there's the tip of the iceberg which is
usually shallow and it catches attention
and it's all shiny and flashy but what
is under that is there actually depth
there or is it just the tip and then
there's no depth and then you kind of
it's impossible to switch from that
dopamine treadmill too okay I need to
actually uh appreciate this and make it
a part of my life and so to further
illustrate this point of how powerful
this actually is because this isn't a
bad thing this really isn't a bad thing
you have to play the game if you are
going to thrive in this attention
economy it's just everywhere everywhere
is somewhere where you can catch
attention right you have to make
yourself look good so that you can
actually catch the attention because
think about it if you can't even catch
the attention but you have let's say a
great developed personality then how in
the world are people going to see that
personality right some of the best
people I know are talked bad about
because they play the engagement game
online right and they are seeing 10
times more success than everyone who
thinks that that isn't a game that they
should play I mean even you look at
certain marketers who are like kind of
world famous and hated by 50 of the
people that see their stuff but then you
watch interviews of them or other things
and they're very down to earth they're
very grounded they're Geniuses they know
what they're doing and they have the
depth to back the front they are putting
on or the tip of the iceberg that they
are showing the world to actually catch
attention and again to illustrate this
further I'm friends with a few Twitter
ghost writers so what those are are
people that write tweets for people it's
like a social media manager but for
Twitter which is a writing platform
right and so too
understand this
one of the ghost writers they had
multiple clients right they write for
multiple people and so a lot of those
people cross over and are in similar
domains and talk about the same thing so
what he did was he literally copy and
pasted the same body of a post a thread
which is like an article short form
article on Twitter where he transferred
that over to another one and he just
changed the first tweet the hook the
first thing that people see the tip of
the iceberg and the difference between
how those two performed is one got maybe
like a hundred likes because the hook
was okay and then the other got 20 000
likes because the hook was amazing and
it caught attention and it led people
into the threat right so the point there
is that the value inside does not matter
until you catch attention if you aren't
playing the dopamine game then you're
never going to let people see your value
but of course this can go awry very well
because if you only have the the tip of
the iceberg and you don't deliver on the
value so let's say someone is on Tinder
or Bumble and they are a catfish that's
what I'm trying to say like a catfish is
where you show in display like oh I look
like this and you manipulate like what
catches the attention and you make
people desire you but then you show up
for the first date and they're nothing
what they look like they have a terrible
personality you guys don't mesh at all
that's not valuable because this is a
universal principle is that value
requires development over time you think
of a pearl from an oyster that is just
closed off to the world forever and then
after some time it opens up and you have
a pearl right the the reason people
think value is so readily available is
because of this whole attention game so
there's there's good and there's bad
things about this game of course and you
have to be a critical thinker in this
age and not Outsource your thinking to
someone else you're not going to be able
to change the game but you can change
change the player and so with this I
will illustrate this again with internet
content right because many of you know
James Clear James Clear is the author of
atomic habits a lot of people reference
his work because of just how much they
loved his book now you think about this
and you see a tweet that James Clear
writes he could literally write the word
habits send the tweet and it would get a
ton of Engagement and someone else does
that they are not going to get the same
engagement why because the people that
follow James Clear understand that he is
an expert and has Authority in the field
because he has depth in the form of a
book and this is what a lot of content
creators and just people in general Miss
right as they start freelancing or they
start posting on social media and they
don't take the time to develop the depth
not only in themselves but in their
brand and in their content and in their
offers right you can promise I will make
you five thousand dollars with this
email marketing service but then if you
can't deliver on it because you haven't
taken the time the three six twelve
months to develop your skill set the
depth in order to deliver on that
dopamine that you are catching attention
with then that's kind that's called a
scam and so in terms of content it's
like people start posting on social
media and they post the same thing as
someone else or something similar and
they're like oh okay I think this will
do well but it doesn't it's because
nobody knows who they are they haven't
changed their perspective on many things
by developing depth with long-form
content right this is why I'm so like I
don't like the advice of oh just just
keep posting tick tocks just keep
posting reels it's like that's not going
to lead you anywhere good if you don't
have a long form blog a long form
newsletter maybe a podcast or a YouTube
where you can actually show that you
know your right because that is
what's going to build the true
appreciation depth and Authority that
you as a a brand and Creator or just
human being in general are looking for
right because it's the same thing with
relationships if you go into a
relationship in let's say high school
that is almost one going to be
dysfunctional 100 of the time if you do
not take the time to develop yourself
and you can see that there is a trap
lying within this whole thing is that if
you latch onto something because of the
dopamine at the start and then you just
call it quits and you don't take the
time to build or nurture whatever it is
that you have possessed because remember
the up world is dopamine and then the
down world the things you possess are
the other neurotransmitters and so if
you don't take the time to actually
create that relationship or nurture that
relationship then it's going to go to
 right you see this all the time
people get into a relationship they kind
of call it quits on their life let
themselves go and then their life and
relationship just sucks because they
fell into that in no initial like
honeymoon phase with whatever it is they
possessed whether it be a car a person
and I'm not saying that you possess a
person we're talking about like they are
a part of your life either way that is
where a lot of the problems can stem is
something's here something's here the
Gap is either shortened to the point of
like I have it now but I haven't
developed the depth that I need to
sustain that or you take the time to
bridge that Gap and you appreciate the
entire process or Journey or as people
say like you gotta fall in love with the
journey it's exactly what it is that's
what we're talking about here is falling
in love with the Journey of developing
depth but also playing the attention
grabbing game so that you can actually
have people see that depth so that is it
for this video but I just want to leave
with a word of advice that is up to you
to take or see as important if you want
to see it as important but that advice
is that
be start being conscious of how you
perceive certain things right and and
take the time to try to deconstruct or
dissect them if you get sucked into this
cycle of like uh like short dopamine
hits where you see like a fancy car
Mansion or even like a body with
six-pack abs and you're like damn I want
that then you either need to bridge that
Gap through self-education on what it
actually takes to get there which is
another form of like chasing that
dopamine and learning
um but you have to understand what it
truly takes you need to break out of
this just narrow-minded close-minded
form of thinking where it's like oh I
want this but I'll never have it oh I I
want this but I'm not going to do
anything with my life because like I
don't know how to get there you have to
see what you want have a desired outcome
and then you have to work towards it and
educate yourself on how to bridge that
gap or gain Clarity on how to get there
and then start acting towards it because
a huge problem that I see people have is
like well I don't know what to do well
you need to take that first shallow
level thing because we've talked about
this before but purpose is found through
solving your own problems and busting
down through those layers from shallow
to deep where you have to just start
pursuing something I don't care if you
start going to the gym because you broke
up with your girlfriend I don't care if
you start trying to make money because
you want a Lamborghini the only way you
are going to figure out what you truly
want is by doing what you think you want
and then realizing that's not what you
want and either pursuing it for a
different reason developing a different
why because you find it important or
pursuing something else from a more
enlightened state or from a better
position it's okay to start over from a
better position because you are going to
do it better that way so that is it for
