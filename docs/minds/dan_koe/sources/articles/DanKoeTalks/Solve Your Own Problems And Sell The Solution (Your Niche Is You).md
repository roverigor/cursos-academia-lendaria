the Creator economy is a decentralized
society where people can learn teach and
create a better life for themselves I
made this realization over the past
decade when I was a child I didn't trust
the education system or my parents or
even my religious teachers to equip me
with the knowledge necessary to secure
my future so instead I consumed content
from YouTubers bloggers and just people
on social media that were giving out the
information that aligned with my
interest or sparked interest in me so
that I could pursue something that the
schools weren't teaching and of course
this usually revolved around increasing
my quality of life right that's what
we're here to do that's what every
single person I believe should aim to do
before they aim to do other big things
right it doesn't make sense to go and
put all of your cognitive power towards
someone else's desires or building
something outside of yourself instead of
fixing yourself first and when I say fix
I do mean fix yourself because by the
time we're 18 and socially conditioned
to the end of hell and probably have an
insane amount of bad habits instilled in
us we have to reverse that damage so
that we can come at other Pursuits from
a better place right so it only makes
sense that every single individual
before they start doing big and great
things so they can do those big and
great things better they fix their Mind
Body Spirit and finances right so when I
was looking at people on YouTube or
bloggers I was watching Fitness people
right to me who's bodybuilding to you it
can be running or cycling and then there
were the business people which I started
in freelancing for you could be
something else it could be something
that I teach or really anything there's
so many different options nowadays and
then the last thing was philosophy or
meaning or the need for Spirit right
something Beyond yourself and because I
personally questioned the religion that
I grew up in so I bought affordable
courses to teach me skills that I
probably couldn't learn any better at
like getting a degree and to think that
a college degree can teach you something
other than getting a job or working for
the school is a bit silly in my opinion
right if a business professor had a
business then why does he have a job
right now there's some Nuance there some
people can be very passionate but at the
same time you look at Jordan Peterson
and it's like he's dishing out
incredible information in his lectures
but at the same time those are going
online and he has a personal brand and
he has grown and spread his ideas beyond
that because he has a business mindset
right what other the only other thing
that he could do is get a job as a
professor I'm sure he had bigger and
greater dreams to go on and do more than
that so he has another thing is that my
college degree which I didn't finish but
I used and leveraged got me into a sixty
thousand dollar a year job and my
internet studies and my self-education
and learning the things that will
learning the skills that unlock infinite
income or just money making as a skill
right because when you're at a job
you're not learning how to make money
making money is a skill that you have to
learn and practice like being at a job
and being handed a paycheck is not
practicing the skill of making money you
have to be in between you have to have a
product or service and you need to
provide it to someone and you need to
facilitate that transaction online and
you need to learn by doing that over and
over again how to make it clickable
process and so education is only one
aspect of the Creator economy but it is
a very important one and there are other
things than it right I believe everyone
should start off with like an education
business but at the same time I see the
Creator economy as a self-sufficient
Utopia now why
because I have a person that sells shoes
I have a person that sells kitchenware I
have a person that sells blue light
glasses I have a person that sells
apparel I have a person that sells
coffee and supplements I have a person
that sells fresh herbs milk and meat
right and all of these hold philosophies
behind them the person that sells
kitchenware may do it because one it's a
passion of his too because he doesn't
want you to be buying all these Plastics
that destroy your health same with the
blue light glasses they're stylish but
at the same time they have the health
benefits of preventing eye strain and
helping you sleep and so this is a prime
example of what I mean in the bottom
tweet from Ryan Ayala a shout out he has
a cool podcast I'm going on later in
June I believe but Ralph Lauren couldn't
find clothes he loved so he decided to
make and sell them himself assuming that
if he wanted them other people would too
very important business lesson then Soul
bra quote tweeted it this is why I made
the soul short a classic short inseam
100 cotton short that was flexible
comfortable and look stylish paired with
whatever on top couldn't find it so I
made it I'm the same exact way but I've
done it with digital products I did it
with modern Mastery like right like what
kind of online community would I have
wanted or did I want to be in right how
was I going to maintain my habits what
what I've what I have wanted to learn
what kind of business material what kind
of skill acquisition what kind of
lifestyle and self-improvement content
in there what kind of tight-knit
community
would form the friendships that I make
throughout my entire life and of course
like to go along with these physical
products we talked about this all last
week about education businesses and
things like that and then evolving into
selling whatever you want because you
have the resources to start like a
physical e-commerce brand or be able to
chill out and make your wooden cutting
board and sell that but there are still
a plethora of individuals out there
aside from the people selling physical
products that I can purchase information
from because then I get to adopt their
worldview it's like a it's like buying a
book right I get to learn skills from
the people that have practice them the
most and have the underlying philosophy
that I resonate with so that I can learn
the skill better schools don't do that
where schools it's like learn this learn
this learn this when you come and learn
from me you're learning from the way
that I like to teach right which in my
case is usually philosophical I'm baking
in some spiritual Concepts and that will
resonate with certain people a lot
better than other people right so I can
help those people more and that is what
creates value so the Creator economy is
where you find people with shared goals
cure create your own Community provide
value to that community and get paid for
your contributions and so my
recommendation is to start with all the
previous letters these are all building
on top of each other when I say letters
I mean YouTube videos so the one person
business playlist
great starting point and you start an
education business by pursuing your
purpose because education has minimal
startup costs and huge profit margins
right so you need to build an income
first so that you can invest that income
to create more right I wrote a tweet the
other day where it's like you don't make
you don't create to make money you make
money to create and then from there you
create an independent income source for
yourself and then you can spend that
money building whatever other kind of
business you want or you can just do
nothing you can retire then because my
little one-person business made 800k
last year which I'm going to break down
in another video and so far this year
it's made 1.5 mil so I'm aiming for 2.5
something around there I'll be
transparent what for what I actually hit
that's just a projection and from that
from selling information products and
education right value some of the most
valuable things there are is what's in
your head and how you operate within the
world right your education with what
I've built from that I'm now writing a
book I'm building a software and these
have meaning behind them for me from
this place of less stress and having to
worry about money I get to strategize
and visualize the impact I want to leave
on the world through my future Creations
right it's creating for fun it's work
has turned into play and the thing with
this is that I didn't fantasize about
building a billion dollar company I just
started with what was right in front of
me which is improving my own Human
Experience because very few people do
that right 95 of the population are by
definition mediocre that's not judgment
that's just the label what it defines
and so by improving my Human Experience
and creating something of value and
becoming valuable then it's almost
impossible to make money because other
people want that but they want to do it
in a better way they want to learn from
someone they resonate with and they want
to be persuaded to actually do it and
take action and so before we start to
get into the deeper stuff I just want to
make everyone aware solopreneur Sprints
is starting up uh enrollment will close
on May 15th uh digital economics as well
will be doubling in price then there's
reasons behind that I've been told to
increase the price so many times it was
9.99 it's already expensive so I don't
know we're gonna try doubling the price
and see what happens I'll link in the
description for both of those
solopreneur Sprints is a two-week cohort
Sprint style digital economics Master
Class both intertwined check them out
both links description build the
solution that solves your problems to
Perfection right the content that speaks
to the person going through that problem
sell the solution with your personal
experiences with that problem build
write and sell to yourself if you want
to eliminate all competition my entire
business Journey was selfish all I did
was build for myself right to myself and
sell to myself right my customer Avatar
was me I built for him I wrote to him
online via internet content of what I
wanted to read what content I liked on
Twitter Instagram YouTube whatever
because when you are the niche it's a
separate video go watch it saturation
and competition cease to exist how how
can it exist when you are the only you
on this planet
and you build the solution that you
would have wanted you write to yourself
you sell to yourself right there's no
cookie cutter Frameworks there that
business courses will give you so if you
want to profit off of your purpose
identify a problem in your life set a
goal to reveal your present purpose
experiment with different solutions find
what works and create your own talk
about your journey in public offer your
solution with a price tag on it
repeating this process has been my
Guiding Light in life because ever since
I can remember I've had a project that I
was building initially it was like
Photoshop art and I was building on
Instagram because I just saw potential
there it's like I want a large following
right it evolved into web design SEO
trying to freelance with a bunch of
different things and then getting a job
at a web design agency and then still
building my web design business first
thing in the morning while at work
trying to make freelancing work and then
I did make it work and I evolved and
it's like okay Twitter's the new project
now Instagram's a new project now I need
to actually create a product and then I
just kept creating I had like 10
different lead magnets right and when I
come and talk to new creators and
they're like oh I'm I don't want to
start I don't want to sell a product
just yet I want to build my audience
first it's like you need to build you
need to build like this is so
important I will have to create an
entire video on it because it's the most
important thing that I did in my life
it's like oh how did you create such an
incredible course like digital economics
I'm praising myself here but it's it's a
great course like I don't even know how
I wrote it I wrote it because I had so
many previous failures out of the way
and people think those failures just
didn't make any money when they made me
a full-time income plus so it's like you
get the crap out and it's not going to
be crap at the time people are gonna
love it and then you're gonna look back
and you'll be like oh that was crap
that's called growth right you want to
grow if you don't have a product or
service that you're offering you aren't
growing as an entrepreneur I mean you're
not an entrepreneur because you don't
have anything you don't have a way of
making money and so a project right I
always had a project to build to solve
one of the problems in my life whether
it be money or Fitness or just having a
hobby a creative hobby like Photoshop I
was solving a problem something a hole
in myself that I tried to patch with a
external project that could go on to be
something more because a project is an
organized way for achieving a goal
therefore it has a purpose and therefore
by working on it you are living with
purpose and that has a slew of benefits
and so to go through the process of like
my planner you have to understand the
how projects evolve right where I saw a
problem in my life which was
productivity I wasn't able to focus and
so I'm like okay I'm gonna watch a bunch
of YouTube videos on this figure out the
strategies I'm gonna order like two or
three planners like the panda planner
and some other ones that I bought from
like Barnes and Noble and then I'm going
to use those I'm gonna see what worked
and I'm going to start to know okay this
worked for me this worked for me this
worked for me create my own system based
on the common patterns in there and then
I created my own planner and then I used
it and I gave it to my friends and then
they used it and I made it better and
then eventually I had something that I
could launch right I launched a free
digital planner and then eventually I
turned it into a physical planner and
then
it's it's just free in my description
now because I don't plan to sell it
anymore it doesn't really align with the
brand at this time I didn't have many
followers on social media so what I did
was I wrote content on what I knew about
productivity because I'd been learning
right and I'd been practicing so I'm
that's qualification enough to talk
about it and give advice and I grew a
following with the proper strategies
that I talk about in my courses and you
can find stuff on social media growth on
YouTube too promoted the digital planner
as a free download and added educational
resources to the free download and
people loved it so I took it further and
made it a physical planner so things are
different now but the entirety of My
Success has been built on solving my own
problems and selling the solution and
you can only do that through
experimentation because you can't just
take someone else's planner and
literally put your name on it and then
sell it right you have to experiment
with things and try things out to make
it your own like if you're a fitness guy
you're gonna have to experiment with all
the different diets all the different
training programs and create one right
you're going to take the best and create
something new so here's a graphic of the
self-reliant career path that we are
going to break down that will lead to
Independent income generation there are
almost 7 billion people on this planet
someday I hope there will be almost 7
billion companies the future of work is
play and everyone will be an
entrepreneur everyone is an entrepreneur
but some just get paid for the value
that they provide in a non-job setting
everyone will be forced to create
contribute and deliver value to their
Community or else their way of survival
will dry up artificial intelligence
points to this reality automation points
to this reality most things on the
internet point to this reality and even
if that does not become the reality for
most people it can for you so the first
thing you need profitable interests with
this we start with life direction right
having direction for your actions a way
to move so you need a vision goals and
priority tasks that you can execute on
every single day watch my video Society
is a pyramid scheme or download the
power planner this description because
this is how you gain experience in life
by moving towards things this is how you
gain knowledge skill and the direction
to acquire both that you can pass down
to those on the same path all burning
problems as we talked about in your life
and others all revolve around the same
things health wealth relationships
happiness Mind Body Spirit business you
selfishness fixing your own problems
because other people have the same exact
problems those are the burning problems
stop avoiding this solve your own
problems sell the solution that's how
you make money at least at the start and
then come and bring some meaning into it
once you're not
worried so much about money because
self-improvement is about solving your
own problems in those domains business
is about solving other people's problems
within those domains so you bring the
two together solve your own problem
solve the solution so simply by setting
a purposeful goal to improve yourself
self-educating and acquiring the skills
for your mind body and business letting
your curiosity guide which methods you
choose to create you will have the
experience necessary to help others and
profit off of living with purpose
curiosity is a crucial touch Point here
what makes you unique is your ability to
find and curate the combination of
knowledge that gets you results you
because in business some may be curious
about e-commerce or website flipping and
then others may be curious in personal
branding and digital products like I am
in hell some people may be curious about
sports and Optimal Performance While
others may be curious about bodybuilding
and biohacking right it's the same
domain with different interests and
Curiosities that an individual will
gravitate towards to solve that problem
in their life of Health finances or
mindset because too often especially
online we think that we're doing the
same thing as everyone else when we're
not we're doing something slightly
different which in the grand scale of
things is vastly different because
that's the thing is everyone has to
pursue their goals in these Eternal
markets right that's what we do you
won't Escape that but the way you pursue
those goals is going to be completely
different because if you just think
about it from like
a a Multiverse perspective right
wherever there's a million different
actions you could take right now in this
very moment and all of those split off
into Infinite different realities and
you take one specific action and then
there's a million more then you take one
and there's a million more and you take
one and there's a million more and
everyone is doing that at any given
second of the day and that's what
creates your story and your story is
your brand and that's what makes you
unique and that is why every single
person on this Earth can have a business
that does not have any competition so
now you have profitable interest right
you're pursuing your goals in health
wealth relationships or Mind Body Spirit
business and you are letting your
curiosity guide you as to which methods
you test and experiment with if you
don't know what to sell you sell
something that you would have wanted on
your journey or something that you want
but can't find right now when you begin
pursuing a goal the best way to
actualize it is to study the
fundamentals to gain Clarity start a
real world project so you don't get
trapped in tutorial hell build up
project until you discover a problem by
courses coaching or research internet
content to find the solution apply
everything you learn until the project
is completed a project doesn't sound
like it applies to all domains of life
but hear me out when you start improving
your health you only make tangible
progress when you turn it into a
measurable personal project you go to
the gym you write down your routine
document every single one of your lifts
and if you aren't seeing progress you
research and find the gaps in your
knowledge maybe it's nutrition that's
holding you back so then it's time to
track your calorie intake and now you
may be seeing progress in your physique
but maybe not in your energy levels and
then maybe you fall down an esoteric
Rabbit Hole of how beef liver is the
most nutrient dense food on the planet
so you experiment with it and see if you
get results and then then you have some
interesting like unique way of getting
results in health specifically that
other people would benefit from that are
like you so when you treat every area of
your life as a purpose oriented project
you were are required to self-experiment
and through self-experimentation you can
create a unique set of experiences and
lessons and skills and expertise that
you can pass down to others so in
marketing you're selling purpose and a
purpose equals goal equals desired
outcome in the health space some people
might sell a running product of 20 to 30
year olds that want to create a healthy
Social Circle and get involved with
their community and others may sell a
weight training program to business Pros
that want to get jacked with only three
days in the gym because they're building
business they don't have too much time
on their hands or so they think they
don't and that way they can have both
money and muscle so they can live a fun
life and who wouldn't buy that right if
I'm a business guy and it's like I'm
making money because I want to have fun
and then I don't have to spend too much
time in the gym but I end up liking the
gym anyways and that makes life even
better that's what you want to you want
a better life and so my writing product
to our writer is my unique experience
and the system I created while building
a personal brand to millions of dollars
in however much we talked about it
earlier earlier and gaining millions of
followers I've experimented with idea
generation newsletter writing and social
media content over the past two to three
years and you don't have to wait that
long right I had products before this I
recommend launching immediately because
you need data and feedback as to how to
make your products better and that can
only be done when you put them in public
the benefits you reap from living with
purpose are your marketing Firepower to
help people live better lives that is
the underlying philosophy you forge
through self-experimentation is how you
generate a creative income from your
Pursuits so the third thing we now have
we had profitable interest we turned it
into a project that would be turned into
a product and now we need a personal
Distribution Center we need traffic we
need people to buy that product because
this is where most people get stuck it's
like oh I have a freelance service but I
don't have any clients so I have this a
cool planner that I made but I don't
have any customers it's because you have
to build and prioritize distribution
this isn't optional and my favorite way
to do this is with a personal brand
because I've done I've got gone through
all the trial and error for you I've
tried the cold Outreach I've tried the
LinkedIn prospecting I've tried the paid
ads and all of those are useful all of
those serve their place but you need the
backbone you need leverage you need
something that compounds over time you
need a personal brand so that you can
display your Authority online and have
clients come to you while at the same
time you aren't just sending you aren't
shooting blanks into the cold email
space and trying to get people without
building an audience right if you were
to send cold DMS while giving out value
and growing an audience then you have 50
000 followers and you've sent the same
amount of DMS and you have the same
amount of clients but now you have 50
000 people more that are waiting to pay
you and so the first thing is that like
yeah that's my favorite way of doing it
second thing is that it's becoming a
necessity whether you are selling a
product or not employers are employers
are hiring based on the value that
people provide online even entrepreneurs
even people that sell a product
sometimes companies will reach out to
them and be like hey come freelance for
us or hey come be the product lead on
this project or hey a help us with our
marketing you build a personal
distribution center by passing down the
lessons you learn pursuing your goals
writing out your thoughts beliefs and
opinions to separate yourself from
others and teaching what you learn in a
persuasive manner that's really it right
I've I've wrote about like how to write
content how to write stuff and like how
to structure your message you should
know that already this is more big
picture this is more abstract like
philosophy behind building a personal
brand and generating an independent
income and it's it's also that's how you
start learning every single marketable
skill there is because with a personal
brand you're going to eventually have to
learn how to create a website or a
landing page you're gonna have to learn
graphic design so you create a banner or
a good profile picture and all of these
determine the success of your brand
right the more skills you have the more
successful you are in the personal
branding game because on your profile
your bio your link in BIO your content
that's all based around copywriting and
content writing and then what about your
email newsletter and all of that acting
as a holistic funnel and then your
products and all of those things you
need everything in place you need all of
the high value skills that people talk
about
but by building a personal brand you
give yourself a year to learn these and
you have somewhere to apply them right
so you're not stuck in tutorial hell the
personal brand is the meta project that
houses all of the projects that turn
into products this is the future career
path and this is how you monetize close
to everything that you could ever learn
or you like learning about and this is
how you get paid for just living the
future belongs to people that pass down
their valuable experiences to improve
others lives that's what all the best
businesses do just take a look at the
next social media post you see from the
lens of a Creator not a consumer and you
can verify this for yourself join in on
the self-sufficient Utopia that the
Creator economy is and thank me later
