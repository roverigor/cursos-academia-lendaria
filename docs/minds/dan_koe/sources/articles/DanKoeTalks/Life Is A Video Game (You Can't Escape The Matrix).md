I remember waking up at 3am before
school so that I could play video games
from Halo 3 to all of the Call of Duties
to League of Legends I was addicted to
say the least increasing my level in
video games took priority over
increasing my level in real life but I
would not change a thing about it how
else would I be able to create this
YouTube video psychology metaphysics
self-help and modern business all point
to life being a video game in a
metaphorical sense of course I'm not
saying that there are a bunch of aliens
that created a giant computer that is
running this simulation but it's quite
similar as we'll come to find out and
I'm not completely closed off to that
idea who actually knows I mean this is
where you get into like conspiracy
theory territory I genuinely don't like
believe that there are aliens like
running our lives but who knows and I
want to break down each perspective from
psychology metaphysics so self-help
business so that you can make progress
towards your goals and fall in love with
the process understand how to tap into
optimal States Of Consciousness stop
taking life so seriously and create your
ideal future reinvent yourself or the
character that plays The Game of Life
and leverage your character to pursue
your life's work and earn a meaningful
income a game is a structured flow of
information life is information or in
formation and our quality of life
depends on how we process that
information this will be in the next
video called mental Aesthetics how to
build a beautiful mind but to give you a
sneak peek of what I mean is your your
body and your mind are very similar
metaphorically or symbolically where the
information like you're overloaded with
information because you don't have a
fast enough mental metabolism to digest
that information in the situation that
you're in and so throughout life the
things that you expose yourself the
chaos and Novelty that you expose
yourself to has to progressively
overload with time so that you can
handle more difficult and stressful
situations when we push too far beyond
our Edge too far into the unknown there
is too much stimulus we can't metabolize
The Experience information builds up and
creates anxiety and overwhelm when we
shy too far away from our Edge too far
into the known there is little novelty
that makes life worth living our mind is
not stimulated information is easy to
digest and we become bored the conscious
mind can process 50 bits of information
per second the unconscious mind can
manage 11 million bits of information
per second so as we become more
efficient at processing information with
the 50 bits available to us and what I
mean by efficient is that we start our
unconscious or subconscious becomes
trained to automatically process
specific information so that frees up
room to process new information or novel
things or new potential so that you can
change your life and when you do this
you free up that conscious attention so
that you can invest your attention in
what you deem meaningful in video games
you have a map the light of awareness
reveals where you have been and what you
have experienced this knowledge allows
you to make better decisions in the
future the darkness of the map is the
unknown and you wouldn't launch yourself
too far from The Gnome you must slowly
puncture the unknown let the experience
normalize through skill acquisition and
emotional management and press forward
one purpose of life is to raise your
Consciousness and this is only possible
by living at your Edge embracing the
story of Life the hives lows successes
and catastrophic failures the most
miserable place you can be is in the
middle before we dive any deeper I have
an announcement I am running the last
solopreneur Sprints simply because I
have other projects coming up the Sprint
cohort style thing is going to move over
to the software business that I'm
building the book launch is it got
pushed back and so I'm running the
solopreneur Sprint long story short if
you're interested in creating your niche
of one building a name for yourself and
creating profitable career and business
opportunities by writing about your
interests online and building leverage
on one-person business everything that
we talk about here what I see as a great
route for people to take to discover and
pursue their life's work then check out
solopreneur Sprints Link in the
description before enrollment closes the
first perspective we're going to talk
about is psychology the optimal state of
inner experience is one in which there
is order in Consciousness this happens
when psychic energy or attention is
invested in realistic goals and when
skills match the opportunities for
Action the pursuit of a goal brings
order and awareness because a person
must concentrate attention on the task
at hand and momentarily forget
everything else that is a quote from the
book flow by mihai chicken so that word
flow you've heard about it before it is
the optimal State of Consciousness that
all Mystics ancients psychologists and
almost everyone points to when they say
oh I feel absolutely amazing right now I
don't have any worries on my mind I'm so
focused at work I'm so at one with
nature whatever it may be it's where you
are at one with being or doing or when
they collapse into one when you are at
one with the task it's called autotelic
activities Auto meaning self telec
meaning goal a self-contained goal in
this state you lose self-consciousness
and move through life without a worry in
the world it seems that the key to the
good life is investing attention and
what we deem meaningful but what you
deem meaningful is found by investing
attention in what you eliminate as
meaningless this process of trial and
error high and low focus and distraction
is the Natural Balance that keeps life
enjoyable but if you get stuck in a low
chaos ensues so we need to understand
the concept of psychic entropy because
ordered Consciousness is what creates
degrees of the flow state two order
Consciousness is to focus your attention
on something external or internal it can
be external like a conversation or a
task or it can be internal like a
thought or an emotion both have their
benefits and it they change the way the
brain operates so there's the task
positive Network in Psychology and the
default mode Network in psychology and a
few other networks that all vary
depending on how you're focusing your
attention whether it's an open state of
focus or a narrow state of focus and I
have this concept I call the focus
Matrix so I'll throw a graphic up on the
screen but there's unconscious narrow
Focus which is like stressed anxious
reactive annoyed unconscious open Focus
which is lost on certain overwhelmed or
a lack of clarity conscious narrow Focus
efficient task oriented Flow State deep
work conscious open Focus which is
present creative relaxed or joyful and
so just by understanding this you can
identify where your focus is how you
feel and start to move within the Matrix
to where you want to feel if you have
some work to do then you need to narrow
your focus on a specific task and use
tools to do that that's why productivity
hacks are so useful is because it's like
okay set a timer that narrows your mind
have a goal create a priority task break
it down into actionable steps know what
you're doing Narrows your mind even
further some people even throw on
headphones they put on a hat they close
all the blinds they do whatever that
just Narrows everything in so you can
you can get into this deep Flow State
and when we lose focus to a distraction
we increase the chances of psychic
entropy so entropy is that everything
tends toward disorder psychic entropy is
that your mind tends toward disorder if
not focused or if your mental system is
not maintained if that order in
Consciousness is not maintained through
conscious effort or energy so when we
give life or attention to something like
a negative thought that creates this
puncture in our system or our frame of
reference or our focus and it allows a
bunch of negative thoughts to come in
like if you were to imagine you're in a
plane and they open the door and
everything just gets sucked out but
imagine it getting sucked out or in to
your mind we can reverse this entropy or
create order by something that I talk
about doing all the time this is very
practical where it's just creating the
habit of zooming out gaining Clarity and
zooming back in So when you focus on a
negative thought your mind Narrows in on
it it starts to close off you start to
forget about that everything is just
fine because you're not zoomed out
you're focused on the negative thought
and then it starts to multiply and your
focus just bounces between them all like
a pinball Until you realize that and
then you zoom out you gain Clarity you
think long term you think about your
vision you think about your goals you
think about everything that's happened
into the day you deconstruct the
situation and then you pull from all of
that to create Clarity and come back
into whatever it is you were doing and
now we have to understand that video
games order Consciousness and there are
things that we can learn from them the
lessons that we learn from video games
can be used to enhance our skill
acquisition learning and self-confidence
because when you first start playing a
game you have no idea what you're doing
you go through a tutorial so you aren't
exposed to everything at once you
practice at level one until that level
becomes boring you are introduced to
more skills traits and abilities to
practice with you progressively over
below the challenge you take on until
you decide to stop playing the game
there must be a skill challenge match in
order to maintain order and
Consciousness so here's a graphic I've
shown before on the left you have the
challenge level on the bottom you have
the skill level the Top If you take on a
challenge that is too high for you you
get anxious or self-conscious if you
take on a task that is too low for you
then you get bored or self-centered and
so you must maintain this balance of
flow or selflessness in the middle
because you start playing a game by
learning the rules first a game
represents any situation in life
especially the ones where you lack
confidence and can't see yourself
winning then you practice the mechanics
of the game there are a series of steps
or quests that provide education and
practice in unison remember this when
you approach anything new or if you get
bored with your current Endeavor if you
are faced with a large challenge then
you need to step back learn and practice
at your level if you are bored with your
current level of challenge you need to
expose yourself to the education of the
next level you slowly start to step into
the unknown you need to practice new
skills and enjoy the neurochemical
cocktail with a double of dopamine as
you transcend into the next phase of
your life so that was the psychological
perspective but let's talk about the
metaphysical perspective or how we live
in a survival based simulation if you
play a video game on your computer such
as Doom or Uncharted you see compelling
3D worlds and 3D objects yet the
information is entirely 2D limited by
the number of pixels on the screen the
same is true when you look away from
your computer to the world around you it
too has pixels and all information is 2D
that's a quote from Donald Hoffman in
his book the case against reality so
Donald Hoffman is a cognitive
psychologist and author of the book I
just mentioned so in the book and the
various podcasts that I've listened to
he argues that human perception is a
user interface to survive in this world
and that this user interface hides the
true nature of reality because if we saw
the truth we wouldn't survive because
through simulation that have been done
natural selection does not favor those
that see the truth or the ones that see
reality as it is and this aligns with
psychedelic enthusiasts like Terence
McKenna who say that language is virtual
reality perception is a closed system
and psychedelics allow you to see beyond
our fitness-based perceptions Hoffman
also argues that space-time is a
visualization tool or that space and
time are compression algorithms they are
the operating system of the user
interface so think of a desktop screen
subjective reality is like a screen that
has been programmed to help us see what
we need to see and do what we need to do
every material object is like an icon on
the screen that you can move around and
play with and possibly delete or lose
and the screen is it's pretty it's
aesthetic it has properties and
qualities and we should take them
seriously but not literally as he says
and on the screen you can click around
and perform specific tasks that result
in a desired outcome these desired
outcomes he calls Fitness payoffs and
these payoffs are like points in a video
game through trial and error we learn
how to win and how to evolve and by
winning your Offspring goes to the next
level in Real World simulations the
organisms that saw the truth of reality
went extinct like an ant trying to have
sex with a glass bottle because it
didn't have the perceptions or the
survival Instinct to mate with another
ant its perceptions were distorted and
it's it's also very interesting that
different organisms have different
perceptions where like a frog can see a
completely different range of color than
humans can and so everyone thinks that
they're seeing the truth but in reality
it's like we're all playing a game of
Grand Theft Auto when we look at our
computers and consoles that run these
programs they are packaged up nicely we
don't see the wires and diodes that
transfer information to create what is
on the screen and even if we did see it
it wouldn't serve our survival we
wouldn't understand it and wouldn't be
able to do anything with the jumble of
electronics even further we can't
comprehend the code that is running the
game and we can draw connections between
Hoffman's theory of this simulation or
user interface and things like
non-duality infinite Consciousness and
mentalism idealism Hinduism Buddhism you
can really pull connections between
anything but those are the main ones
where to me this feels more right than
most other theories of everything the
thing here is if you were to remove this
user interface or human perception with
a tool like psychedelics you would
eventually go insane and I'm not saying
that insane is bad necessarily maybe
that's the truest thing there is maybe
that's Ultimate Reality maybe that's ego
death but like when you're trying to
operate within the real world or in this
Survival game that's not going to serve
you very much and you're probably going
to die sooner than later because you
just won't be able to survive you won't
have that instinct and there is a reason
why people aren't on psychedelics 24
hours seven days a week we aren't at
that phase of evolution yet and as I've
mentioned earlier with the mental
bodybuilding or your your mind not being
able to digest that much chaotic
information or make sense of it because
how infinitely complex Consciousness is
in and of itself if we were exposed to
all of that that's like man how would
you even put it that's like trying to
physically eat the universe that's
impossible that does not mean that you
can't understand or have that awareness
or have that grounding in it so that you
can make better decisions with your life
and live in a meaningful life and I like
to think of this as the mind being a
vessel where the human mind is a vessel
and reality flows through it so you
think of a projector the light that the
projector emits is consciousness and the
film is your mind the light shines on
the film and displays a spectrum of the
experiences that humans have it frames
our perception the film is our
perception that's the user interface
that we're operating within so the third
and more practical perspective for life
being a video game is the self-help
perspective life is a game stack gold
acquires skills gain experience unlock
new levels and eventually get to a point
where you have the resources to do
whatever you want when your operating
frame is focused on the process that
will actualize your future your focus is
impenetrable and you live in a world of
your own design the difference between a
video game in real life is virtual risk
versus real risk the sameness between a
video game in real life is learning
practice and becoming a dopamine junkie
video games have tutorials professions
quests and an unknown to explore real
life has childhood career paths
responsibilities and potentials that you
are unaware of but once discovered can
drastically change how you think act and
work once you understand the
significance of the patterns Illustrated
between video games and life you can
begin to correct your behavior in a way
that is conducive to your future no
problem can be solved from the same
Consciousness that created it Albert
Einstein to raise your Consciousness you
must raise your level of mind to raise
your level of mind you must open your
perspective to open your perspective you
must identify problems take on the
challenge a require the skill and
receive the knowledge necessary to
transcend your previous identity with
each level of mind your identity must
change the knowledge skill belief and
experience you order in your mind as
self determines the opportunities
available to you at level one you have
access to Opportunities slightly above
your level the opportunities you can
register in your awareness exist on a
spectrum as you level up you still have
access to all of the opportunities
underneath you and those slightly above
your skill it is a massive disservice to
your life to distract yourself and never
see what you are capable of we need to
understand how to create our own games
if games have a desired outcome winning
a path to get there progression and
habitual actions to take priorities then
we can create games out of any situation
in life this Universal principle of
purpose process and priority is the
underlying framework of human behavior
if you don't have a goal you don't have
a vision if you don't have a path you
don't have Clarity if you don't have a
task you don't have Focus most of your
problems in life can be solved by
understanding and applying this
principle to create a game you need a
hierarchy of goals that frames your
attention as an example a 10-year goal
that allows your vision to Blossom
yearly goals monthly goals weekly goals
all of which are loosely held in the
back of your mind they should not be
your master but your guide only from
there can you align your daily education
and love removing actions with them
you're overly focused on the negative
parts of life because you haven't built
positive responsibilities that demand
your focus the more attention you invest
in your goals the stronger their gravity
becomes and lastly for the self-help
perspective we need to know that all
change is behavior change to change your
life you must change your actions to
change your actions in the right
direction you need a plan there isn't
any other way and if you don't create
your own someone will create a plan for
you to stick to the plan you need a
system systems or organized Behavior
changes to create a system you must
attack your goals embrace the nature of
trial and error double down on your
successes and persist until success
becomes the default state in each area
of your life health wealth relationships
and happiness if you have made it this
far congratulations you made it past
three perspectives psychology
metaphysics and self-help and now the
most practical perspective I can give
you is the business perspective or the
new Digital Society eventually everybody
will be in the Creator economy from
Naval ravacon the world is shifting from
corporate dominance to individual power
thanks to technology this is reflected
in nature through the principle of
division and unity everything divides
and reunites over time this is also this
also wraps in entropy or that nothing is
permanent in the Renaissance Era the
economy favored the multi-dimensional
the polymass the artists who refused to
limit their abilities the thinkers
creators designers Builders and
individuals who took responsibility for
their mental physical and Spiritual
Development in the digital Renaissance
we are going through history is
repeating itself we can learn anything
do anything and become anything thanks
to the vast and Rapid information
expanding at our fingertips the
expansion of the mental plane of
existence through the internet has
created a field of infinite potential
communication is no longer local
Commerce is no longer local friendships
are no longer local Society is no longer
fragmented the crater economy is virtual
reality your personal brand is your
character online business is the game
and progression networking is how you
build a powerful tribe purposeful
products are how you make a living the
intrinsic philosophy you cultivate
throughout your journey is the marketing
Firepower that attracts those like you
you are a part of the Creator economy
right now the question is which side are
you on are you engaging in the mutual
benefit of value exchange product for
money or are you draining your attention
overloading your mind and wasting your
creative ability by not producing
anything in return for the value you are
taking business is arguably the most
spiritual Endeavor you can take business
is how you train your spirit it is how
you get better at contributing to
humanity something greater than you
spirit and of course my favorite way of
framing this is the one person some
business or just turning yourself into
the business so a graphic that you can
screenshot but we're going to go over
each of these how goals turns into brand
how problems turn into content how
systems turn into product how benefits
turn into marketing and a classic quote
from Ellen Watts that I love is that
sensible people get paid for doing what
they enjoy doing first let's talk about
brand or that you are the most
profitable Niche your brand is your
online avatar strong brands have Vision
a big irrational goal that they are
leading their followers toward the
gravity of that goal and the energy
displayed along with it is what attracts
people to you your brand is your highest
version it is who you are becoming it is
your Guiding Light toward a better
future that allows you to align your
actions with goals through a tangible
vessel that others can benefit massively
your job is to display who you are in
your profile picture images bio and
website your style shapes your design
and your vision shapes your bio your
goals shape the content product and
marketing you create under your brand
hierarchy the second thing is content or
Lessons Learned completing quests your
content is the ideas thoughts beliefs
opinions lessons and advice you acquire
as you pursue your challenging hierarchy
of goals do you see the power in this
writing has changed my life it has
brought self-awareness
self-understanding and the ability to
organize my thoughts or order
Consciousness to make life more
enjoyable this is the driving factor of
why I created my course to our writer to
teach you what is arguably the most
valuable skill high impact writing and
something that will never go out of
style even with the emergence of AI
because you don't need fancy content
Frameworks and templates these help of
course but the best content doesn't come
from these the best content comes from
energy transfer as you acquire Knowledge
and Skills through your education and
your learning and just experiencing life
there are going to be things that
register in your awareness more than
others the things that cause excitement
or increase dopamine the novel ideas the
things that you see useful viewing from
the lens of your vision if you don't
have a vision you can't do this you need
a vision or a goal and an active problem
that you're solving so you can filter
good information from bad and when you
do find the good information you feel it
and you note it down and then you share
it with other people online and that
alone since it caused excitement in you
it's going to cause excitement in other
people if you get that content spread
and know how to grow and it's that
simple that's how you attract a
like-minded tribe so after brand and
content you need a product or systems
for Behavior change because the best
products spark positive behavior change
Behavior change is reflected in the
Eternal markets of business health
wealth relationships and happiness so
write to yourself build for yourself and
sell to yourself create a product or
service out of the Knowledge and Skills
you've acquired on your journey
something that you would have wanted or
something that would truly benefit your
life right now there are individuals in
the crater economy that sell literally
everything from courses to software to
cotton pants because they're afraid of
the chemicals and the polyester pants
and blue light glasses planners coaching
kitchenware shoes anything just a
product or service us that people
actually need in their everyday life
that is the thing here is how are you
going to make people healthier happier
wiser or wealthier with the knowledge
that you gain by pursuing your goals and
figuring it out for yourself and people
will object here and tell you to start a
real business but what they mean is I am
fabricating problems that don't benefit
Humanity don't start a business around
real problems that will raise the
collective Consciousness people who have
a poor relationship with money will
think that marketing and sales are evil
they don't understand that the exchange
of goods is human nature it's been
around forever and that means something
money is neutral until you put it in the
hands of good or evil consistent
progression towards your conscious goals
ensures that you lean toward good when
you solve your own problems and sell the
solution you can guarantee that those
problems exist on the cosmic scale and
rest well knowing that you are making a
difference the last is marketing because
you need a brand to build leverage and a
readership you need content to also
nurture and build that and you need a
product to monetize but then you can't
monetize if you don't how to know how to
Market or promote yourself so it is wise
to study marketing and sales see either
of my one million dollar skill stack
videos they are evergreen skills backed
with psychological and metaphysical
principles of value exchange of course
there are tainted aspects of those
skills people who lack moral development
will use them for evil but like money
these skills are neutral until wielded
so invest in education around these but
do so to note patterns and principles
that shape your articulation and
persuasive ability from there use an
intrinsic philosophy that you cultivate
while you're playing the game goals
imply problems and problems imply
struggle you will struggle on this
journey but the Lessons Learned are what
increase your level of mind the reasons
or whys behind your Pursuit is how you
promote the product you create to the
people you've attracted why did you
start training in the gym or facing your
health why did you improve your
relationships and social life why did
you increase your wealth through
business skill and professional Pursuits
the why is what creates emotion in your
readers from there you can learn tactics
to test on your business to increase
Revenue but don't lose your soul in the
process that's it for this one of my
friends life is a game and of course
solopreneur Sprints the last one is
running and enrollment will be closing
soon so check out Link in the
description for that if you want to
build your brand really with what we
talked about in that last section of
this which is build a brand learn to
write content learn to create a product
learn to Market it and aside from that
there's two hour writer digital
economics both courses with high value
skills that you can learn free stuff
