## Notable Quotes & Insights

**On Prescriptions:**
"Prescriptions are how-to's... whenever you venture into the realm of art in any form be it in business or sports... those things cannot be prescriptionized. If you attempt to prescriptionize them what happens is the prescription becomes the new god."

**On Freedom:**
"Freedom is freedom from the mind. The only reason that any human being is not free is because of his mind."

**On Truth:**
"Everyone is looking for truth whether they profess to look for truth or not and the evidence for that is that everyone is looking for a way out of their problems."

**On Hard Work:**
"I think hard work is yet another example of a prescription to be honest with you. I think it's done largely out of anxiety. I think hard work is done largely out of fear."

**On Exposure:**
"A human being becomes his environment and that is why it's absolutely critical to savagely and surgically arrange one's environment in a way that is in accordance with where he wants to go."

**On Understanding:**
"The solution to any problem lies squarely deep within the problem. There are not two things there's only one."
