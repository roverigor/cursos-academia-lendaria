## Article Content

Naval challenges the notion of working 80-hour weeks, arguing that such claims are largely a "farce".

### Core Argument

> "Let's get serious. Nobody works eighty hours a week. Not eighty real, productive hours."

> "Let's drop the farce, ok? Even when you had to work eighty hours, you didn't, really."

Naval explains that when looking closely at workaholics, "a lot of the time is spent idling, re-charging, cycling, switching gears, etc. In the old days this was water-cooler talk. In Silicon Valley, it's gaming, email, IM, lunches, and idle meetings."

### Key Points

1. **People don't actually work 80 productive hours per week**
2. **Worktime includes significant "idling" and non-productive activities**
3. **Productivity has diminishing returns**

### Economic Perspective

> "In economic terms, there is lower diminishing marginal productivity beyond some point. This point hits differently for different problems (some, like software engineering, require a lot of startup time to load a complex problem into your working memory)."

### The Reality of Productive Work

> "Your best work was probably done in tremendous, focused bursts, surrounded by long periods of dullness and inactivity. So, let's try to figure out how to maximize the probability and productivity of such a burst, rather than try and force it to be predictable and prolonged."

### Recommendations for Maximizing Productivity

1. **Measure Outputs, Not Inputs**
   - Focus on results rather than time spent working

2. **Measure Productivity Over Longer Periods**
   - Evaluate performance across weeks and months
   - Recognize creative people may have intense bursts followed by slower periods

3. **Introduce Peer Pressure**
   - Collaborative environments can inspire productivity
   - "Get two productive people in the same room on the same problem"

4. **Create Conducive Work Environments**
   - Use non-traditional settings
   - Allow flexible hours
   - Provide personal space

5. **Prioritize Accountability**
   - "Be ruthless on accountability and output over the long term"
   - "Nothing damages a startup like a mediocre and reliable performer"

The article concludes with a tongue-in-cheek "Now go work harder…" directive.
