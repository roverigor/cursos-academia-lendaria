## Article Content

Naval discusses how modern Internet entrepreneurs have unprecedented leverage compared to previous generations.

### Key Insights

- **The cost of starting a business has dramatically decreased**
  - What once cost millions now costs thousands
  - Technology and online services have reduced startup barriers

### The New Economics

> "Less labor required. Less capital required. Less cost to scale. Larger markets. Cheaper marketing. No cost to ship more product."

Naval argues that entrepreneurs aren't necessarily smarter or harder-working than before, but they have access to:

- **Global online markets**
- **Low-cost infrastructure** (cloud services, open-source tools)
- **Viral marketing channels**
- **Near-zero marginal costs** for digital products

### The Transformation

The most significant change is the potential for massive, rapid scaling. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter have demonstrated how quickly a startup can grow and achieve enormous valuations.

Cost examples:
- What used to cost $1M-$2M to set up, now costs $10K
- What used to cost $5M to build, now costs $250K
- What used to cost $20M to go to market now costs $1M

However, the upside hasn't gone down.

### Core Insight

> "The returns to scale for being smart, young, skilled, and high-energy have gone up tremendously."

An additional insight from the Hacker News comment suggests the entrepreneurial landscape has shifted from a normal distribution to a "power-law distribution" - meaning fewer, but much larger winners.

The core message is that technological leverage has fundamentally transformed entrepreneurial opportunities, allowing younger, skilled individuals to create massive value more quickly than ever before.
