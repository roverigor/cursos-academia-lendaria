that's an excellent example of what's
called a crucial test which is sort of
the pinnacle of what science is all
about
if we do a test and it doesn't agree
with a particular theory that we have
that's problematic but that doesn't mean
that it refutes the theory because
if you were to refute the only theory
that you have
where do you jump to you don't have any
alternative if we were to do a
scientific test tomorrow
and it was inconsistent with the theory
of general relativity
then what there is no alternative to
general relativity
in fact when there have been experiments
over the years that seem to have been
inconsistent with general relativity
guess what they've all turned out to be
faulty if you had to choose between
whether or not general relativity has
been refuted by your test
or your test is flawed go with the fact
that your test is being flawed
in the case of eddington's experiment we
had two
viable theories for what gravity was we
had newton's theory of universal
gravitation on the one hand
and we had einstein's general theory of
relativity on the other this
experiment that you described of how
much the light was bent during a solar
eclipse
the correct way of describing what
happened is not that
we showed that general relativity was
correct in some final sense but rather
we refuted newton's theory of
gravitation
newton's theory was ruled out because it
was inconsistent with the test
while general relativity was consistent
with the test this doesn't mean that
general relativity is the final word in
science
it means that it's the best theory we
have for now and there's a whole bunch
of reasons
that we might think general relativity
ultimately has to turn out false we
never have the final word and that's a
good thing that's a really positive
optimistic thing because it means we can
keep on improving we can keep on making
progress
and we keep on discovering new things
there is no end of science
the long thought about idea that so many
have feared that one day progress will
come to a halt that science will end
in fact we are at the beginning of
infinity and we will always be at the
beginning of infinity precisely because
we can improve our ideas because we're
fallible human beings
so none of our theories are perfect
because we aren't and our process by
which we create knowledge isn't perfect
either
it's error-prone
