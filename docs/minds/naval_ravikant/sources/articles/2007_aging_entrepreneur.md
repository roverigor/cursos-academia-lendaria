## Article Content

Naval explores the relationship between age and entrepreneurial success, drawing heavily on Marc Andreesen's analysis.

### Key Observations

1. **Productivity typically peaks at different ages** depending on the field, ranging from late 20s to early 50s.

2. **Success is more about quantity of attempts than quality**, as noted in this quote:

> "The odds of a hit versus a miss do not increase over time. The periods of one's career with the most hits will also have the most misses."

3. **The entrepreneurial drive is significantly influenced by:**
   - Free time
   - Less to lose
   - Enthusiasm
   - "Sublimated sex drive"

### Age and Entrepreneurship

Naval argues that younger entrepreneurs have advantages:
- More free time
- Less risk aversion
- Higher enthusiasm
- Competitive drive

He notes that modern web entrepreneurship especially "favors the young and single" due to:
- High competition
- Rapid iteration requirements
- Technical and business challenges

### Core Insight

> "Anecdotal evidence aside, entrepreneurship favors the young."

The key concept is that maximizing quantity — taking more swings at the bat — is much higher payoff than trying to improve one's batting average.

### Conclusion

While older entrepreneurs can succeed, the structural demands of entrepreneurship—particularly in technology—tend to advantage younger founders.

The piece concludes with a wry observation that many older entrepreneurs "give up and just become VCs."
