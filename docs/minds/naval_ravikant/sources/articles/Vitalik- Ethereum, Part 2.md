vitalik i want to ask you a little bit
about
how your role has evolved since it began
in ethereum so in the very beginning
before all of this of course you were
once the
uppity young entrepreneur it's been what
six seven years now
you've moved on from being the
entrepreneur to being the chief
technologist to being the politician
you're now the elder statesman of smart
contract blockchains what have you
learned about protocol politics
protocol politics is less different from
regular politics than you might think
it's all this emergent phenomenon of
what happens when you stick many
thousands of people together and you
have incentives that are aligned in some
cases so you have some competition in
other cases and you have different
groups of people that have different
opinions and they have to fight it out
sometimes within one protocol and
sometimes between different protocols
where there's competition
a lot of the dynamics that you get are
surprisingly familiar the kinds of
religious fervor that you get when
people defend their opinions is it
better to have watch-ins that have
smaller blocks so they're easier to
verify versus bigger blocks so that more
people can afford to use them people
have very strong opinions in the same
way that people have strong opinions
about either religion or democracy or
freedom of speech or the welfare state
or any other mainstream political topic
you built your career as a response to
bitcoin maximalism and you've now lived
long enough to see the rise of ethereum
maximalism three four years ago it
didn't seem like something like that
existed and now it's become very clear
that as you have all these alternatives
to ethereum arising
there's a strong need for people within
ethereum to set apart their identity
from other people so i'm curious how you
think about how to keep ethereum
healthy and not see in the ethereum
community degrade
culturally and religiously the way that
you saw the bitcoin community degrade
one of the things that i feel like i've
learned over the last decade is that
people are at their morally worst not
out of greed but out of fear and
this is true in mainstream politics and
this is true in geopolitics and crypto
as well kovic showed that that was all
fear driven the russia ukraine crisis
shows that russia is not attacking
ukraine to get oil fields it's out of
fear the responses are all fear-based
and fear is used to justify all the
horrible things from the patriot act to
the covet lockdowns fear drives it all
because greed is always done in your own
name and nobody wants to do it in their
own name fear is always done in
everybody else's name so you end up with
a whole bunch of self-styled white
knights battling each other
right and even when the leader actually
is greedy and megalomaniacal fear is
what they use to sell it to run out
the times when i thought both the
bitcoin and the ethereum community were
both at their morally worst would
probably be in the bitcoin cash small
versus big block war crisis where people
felt like there was this very zero-sum
struggle between one vision of what
bitcoin would be in another vision of
what bitcoin could be a lot of
principles got thrown out people behaved
terribly in a bunch of ways
in the case of ethereum there was this
big application called the dow and the
dow got hacked and a big portion of all
of the eath was stuck in the dow if
nothing had been done the attacker would
have been able to get it out after a
couple of months and this was less than
a year into ethereum's history so a
decision was made to make a change to
the rules of the ethereum protocol to
bail out the users of that application
and there was this big debate some
people thought this was fine one time
because it was early days and some
people thought that it should be a
principle that we never interfere and
it's best to start those principles from
day one we did end up hard forking to
fix the doubt and a lot of people
disagreed that ended up splitting
ethereum into two chains ethereum and
ethereum classic where theorem classic
refused to implement the hard fork so
they let the attacker get away out of
principle
the way that both communities behaved at
the time was not good people were openly
advocating that we should use trademark
law to try to not allow ethereum classic
to exist and then people were advocating
51 attacks and all kinds of things
i think the reason why people are okay
with things that they would totally not
have been okay at any other time is
because they were afraid ethereum people
were afraid that ethereum classic would
replace and completely destroy ethereum
and ethereum classic people would be
afraid that their principles were being
destroyed by ethereum which could then
grow and overtake the version of the
chain that stuck to its principles the
situation did end up working out well
for most people there hasn't been a
violation of that kind of immutability
on ethereum since which is something
that a lot of people are not projecting
a lot of people did think that if you
violate the principles once then it
would be open season to do it many times
but no people valued not fixing the
parity wallet a year later in order to
set the counter precedent that we
actually do take this serious there was
a bug in a multisig wallet called the
parity wallet which caused a massive
loss of funds but to be clear i think
the dow hack was much larger in
magnitude than anything subsequently
correct
yeah it was much larger and it was very
unique and that it was even possible to
fix it with a fork because normally when
a hack happens the attacker gets the
money instantly and there isn't a way to
fix it even if you want to so the dow
was really special and unique in that
way
as a protocol politician
what do you feel has been your finest
moment and your worst moment of
blockchain statecraft
least proud moments definitely
handling the dow fork situation a lot of
people did feel betrayed as a result of
the dow fork a lot of people did feel
like their expectations got violated and
a lot of people
who
felt like their opinion was disrespected
especially people who opposed a fork a
lot of them did feel like there was a
social environment where if you opposed
a fork then you're evil because your pro
hacker is stealing millions of dollars
that environment ended up turning a lot
of people off there was a lot more that
we could have done to not create that
environment and still make people feel
welcome despite the disagreement do you
regret the decision or you read the way
in which the decision was made
i don't think i regret the decision i
think the decision did have a lot of
positive consequences too in how it put
a controversial stake in the ground and
people
interpreted the stake in the ground in
different ways the way i interpret the
snake in the ground is that it was a
moral statement that said that you can
believe in principles without assigning
those principles infinite amount of
weight without saying that we're going
to stick to those principles in
absolutely all possible circumstances
and that kind of moderation is something
that's very morally important to me
personally it's very pragmatically
important to me personally too because
most people that try to take a more
purist approach end up hitting a
scenario that is extreme enough that you
have to compromise and if you committed
too hard to never compromising then your
rhetorical posture becomes even more
screwed up it's better to be transparent
about these things early on people who
are pragmatic and people who were
willing to look at things in a more
moderate way they're definitely very
happy as a result of that but there are
also the purists and there were even
people who believe in moderation that
actually opposed to delfort which was
interesting too those people ended up
sticking with ethereum despite the
doubtful work happening but there
weren't a lot of people for whom the
dell fork was this watershed moments
where like they were curious about
ethereum before then they realized oh
wow no this is a centralized evil chain
which is unfortunate that we can't
satisfy everyone but on the other hand
satisfying everyone is expensive and
satisfying everyone so hard i sometimes
even think had we successfully satisfied
everyone during the dow fork then might
we not have had much harder politics
getting proof of stake out the door
i see you taking incredible slings and
arrows on twitter and being very
good-natured about it something that
zuko seems to also do the visible
leaders of protocols or creators of
protocols because i'm not even sure
ethereum is really led anymore they tend
to have this ability to operate in
public either with a certain nonchalance
or with a certain combativeness that
normal humans i don't think could
sustain how did that come about do you
wish you'd just remain anonymous did you
have to go through a learning curve to
learn how to deal with all the trolls
and all the haters and all the bitcoin
maxie's attacking you do you wish you
could just press a button and disappear
from eth and then it goes into the
foundation's hands
there's definitely a learning curve
there's big mistakes that i made in my
twittering in years past especially
times when i would let myself get
carried away in a particular discussion
and i'd say something and i feel like
i'd have to justify myself and i'd go
into a deeper hole you wish you didn't
argue as much on twitter is that what
you're saying
yeah you learn over time there is a good
style it accepts the criticism with
grace you learn what to respond to your
and what's what slide because
realistically no one's gonna see it
anyway there's definitely like
subconscious intuitive art to being a
good twitter meme lord and being a good
crypto member in general how much
influence do you have on each today
especially compared to the dow fork time
because my sense was in the dow fork we
were very involved but if something of
that magnitude came up today how much
influence would you have relative to
what you had then i feel like my
influence at aetherium keeps decreasing
every six months i have less now than i
did six months ago six months ago i had
less than i had a year ago and then a
year ago i had less than i had 18 months
ago these days the number of people that
i have to convince to push in a
particular direction is significant
watch some of the eips that i personally
promote some of them don't even make it
in for a lot of them you have to try
pretty hard to satisfy all people's
concerns what's the biggest thing you
push that isn't getting adopted
eip 4488 is one example if i had more
control it would have been in ethereum
already what is that one this is the one
to
do a short-term decrease in the gas cost
of call data it's fairly technical
change that makes roll-ups cheaper in
the short term it seems to me like a lot
of your evolving role within ethereum
shows ways in which blockchains are like
religions imagine the ethereum started
off as a sect that you found it as a
charismatic leader and you were like hey
we're going to break off from the
religion of bitcoin or break off the
religion of mastercoin i believe in
these new principles of turning
completeness once upon a time you were
the sec leader and as the sect becomes a
church there becomes more bureaucracy
more vitocracy there's more and more
mechanisms that are developing behind
the scenes and pretty soon you might be
the charismatic voice of ethereum but
the formal leadership of ethereum has
taken on its own
life force what is your observation of
how
ethereum has become more systematized as
a culture compared to what it was five
years ago
today the protocol decisions tends to be
done through this mechanism called the
ulcor devs call like this is a call that
happens once every two weeks as the name
implies all of the core developers come
online and talk about all the proposed
protocol changes and everything that
people agree on gets accepted and if
people disagree then like it doesn't get
accepted so there's this fairly
complicated pipeline that changes have
to go through step one is the idea
making stage then step two is the
refining stage then there's the stage of
convincing more and more people making a
test implementation eventually turning
it into a fully formalized proposal what
we call an eip and ethereum improvement
proposal and then finally gets into an
all-core downs and then if all core devs
accepts it then it eventually goes into
a hard fork which is what we call a
protocol upgrade to ethereum which
includes changes to the protocol that
everyone has to download to get accepted
to the network
so
there is this long process there's many
points along the way where different
people have to agree near the beginning
the research team has to agree and then
in the later stages the core developers
the people actually writing the code
have to agree as well so it's definitely
more vinocratic considerably than it was
three years ago and definitely much more
than it was six years ago when we could
get a change accepted and it would get
included very quickly and even now like
i feel the window is closing on
substantial things it's getting harder
to do big things even today
how do you feel about that
in some ways relieved ethereum becoming
more videocritic gives me more freedom
to retire well retire is a complicated
word i feel like i'll keep doing things
forever but what kinds of things as
you've mentioned my role is changing in
complicated ways that are hard to
describe what would you be working on if
you weren't working on leaf
good question i'd have my big long list
of things that i think need to happen
and i would do some combination of
writing about it explaining them and
probably putting some of my own money
into making them happen trying to put
teams together and make them happen this
would be things like account security
like what we talked about with social
recovery wallets ideas around privacy
some of the secure blockchain based
voting stuff that i've been pushing the
entire roadmap of what do we need to do
to make this ideal trustless
decentralized society work you've
already had that the aforementioned amms
that haseeb uses automated market makers
that was an idea that came out of one of
your blog posts and then it got
implemented as unit swap any other
low-hanging fruit there social recovery
wallets i heard that one blockchain
voting if you're a young hacker
listening to this podcast and let's say
you're not shilling eth but you're like
hey the world needs this someone should
build it what would they build right now
decentralized clients is one important
thing ways to access the ethereum
blockchain that are cheaper than running
a full node but they're still
decentralized that don't depend on a
server it's something that's going to
become much more possible with a switch
to proof of stake and there's some
people working on it but we could use
more people working on it there's things
that the application layer that could be
useful i've seen people working on
decentralized vpns which are cool
do you feel like there's any
applications of blockchain that haven't
taken off yet because of scalability or
it's not ubiquitous not everybody has a
wallet yet what's the extreme case what
could people be doing with blockchains a
decade from now that seems like science
fiction today
some kind of decentralized blockchain
based social media would be interesting
the thing that would be valuable to do
with social media is to split the layers
between content and user interface
content should all be on one shared
layer and people should compete on
providing different interfaces twitter
and reddit gets users make comments and
users make votes the only real
difference is what are the interfaces
that people use to show it so why not
create an ecosystem where anyone can go
post stuff and people can post things
that link to other things that people
can make messages that are upvotes and
down votes and people can post other
people's posts and just have 10
different ways of viewing yet they might
have different presentation they might
have different styles of moderation we
might have different sub communities
some might be more free-for-all some
might be more restrictive some might be
more focused on specific areas
some might be free speech zones and some
might be venues for like highly focused
scientific discussion but things would
still end up sharing the network effects
of having the same common standards of
content being published to one
decentralized network people have tried
to do it somewhat but nothing's taken
off why is that if we have a super
scalable blockchain where we can afford
to stick these kinds of actions on by
defaults then what could happen
who do you look up to who are your
heroes
in the crypto space i have a lot of
respect for zuko zcash it's just a
wholesome and honorable project it
values privacy and it's just working
really hard at achieving it in this
theory friendly way he's incredibly
friendly the amount of abuse he puts up
with is unbelievable and he's one of the
og's in crypto he's been in it forever
for all the right reasons i remember
talking to zuko in the early days and i
was like hey if you build this thing is
it even legal what if they arrest you he
said i'll miss my kids but i'll go to
jail he's a real believer he also has
this habit of retweeting people even
when they attack him
one of my favorite twitter moments was
years and years ago where somebody
tweeted and said zuko stop retweeting
useless crap so of course zuko retweeted
this person
who became an accidental genius
now i'm trying to remember whether or
not i picked that up from zuko i do
think zuko set the tone for how you
build a community with a smile for
example now zuko is talking about taking
z cash to proof of stake and he still
keeps getting attacked over things like
the founders reward and people say why
did you have to go build an altcoin why
did you support a bitcoin i remember
originally he wanted to do it as part of
bitcoin but they said no go implement it
as an altcoin first and then if we like
it we'll adopt it vitalik knows that
story well exactly bitcoin is trying to
be a certain thing i do think bitcoin is
incredibly valuable it is the og it does
fall short in two ways one is it's not
programmable and the second is not
private can those be fixed not without
severe trade-offs to what bitcoin is so
it occupies a very important part in the
ecosystem probably the most important
part but it doesn't mean that that's the
entire thing there's a lot more to it
and bitcoin may have nailed the basic
protect your money austrian economic
style use case but there are many more
use cases the thousand flowers that have
bloomed on ethereum and other smart
contract blockchain since has been
incredible
and as haseeb said we're going to see a
proliferation of blockchains one the
incentives are just too strong second
there are different trade-offs you're
making between decentralization and
security and programmability there are
people coming up who are saying well
we're more programmable gorick is saying
you can write javascript based smart
contracts there are people who are
saying that with faster and simpler out
of the box you have to deal with layer
twos and rollups and sharding and all
that you just write and it's easy to run
there's some parts in the spectrum i
understand things like finance smart
chain the level of decentralization is
so low they just stick their name in it
but it's obviously for the people who
care a lot less about decentralization a
lot more about cost and performance and
so on it's going to be a very rich
ecosystem blockchains are a fundamental
shift into a new form of computing and i
think you do have to be good-natured
about it because there are all these
disingenuous attacks on it like the
berkeley professor who wrote this long
piece about how his raspberry pi has
more throughput and therefore if or
bitcoin will fail it was just a nonsense
comparison it's just apples and oranges
you're comparing an airplane to a car
just two different things yet he wrote
pages and pages of this like only a
berkeley professor could i guess these
are what nassim taleb calls the iyi's
the theme has the completely opposite
twitter strategy of italic where if
somebody attacks him he just executes
them speaking of which metallic who
would you say are your enemies
unfortunately vladimir putin's lovely
russian government is one of my enemies
now
i did talk to him five years ago i
believe in talking to people i talked to
putin i talked to the vice premier of
taiwan at one point i talked to people
in the government of singapore i've
talked to people in canada uk and lots
of places but at the same time there
definitely are times when you make the
judgments that you have given someone an
awful attitude and as much as it would
be good to give someone even more love
unfortunately at the present time there
are
cities that are being bombs there are
millions of lives and people's families
and futures that are being potentially
destroyed and cut short and a beautiful
country that risks being turned into
syria ultimately for its priority has to
be doing all that we can to help people
affected by that situation so that's a
really unfortunate thing and i've been
very public in speaking out that i do
fully support ukraine and i do strongly
oppose all of the characters that are
complicit in trying to destroy ukraine
as a country and as a nation and i used
a russian profanity that some ukrainian
soldiers made famous because of how they
used it as a brave show of defense
against russian soldiers that demanded
they surrender and i repeated it to the
head of russia today so my general
approach was that i don't believe it
being mean zero percent of the time i
believe in being mean like maybe 0.5
percent of the time if you're mean only
0.5 percent of the time then that
actually makes that meanness more
effective whereas you're the sort of
person that being mean as your default
mode of discourse that's at some points
people just stop paying attention to it
the bitcoin community can learn from
that a little bit
although they're definitely kind people
within bitcoin too as we just have to be
a little quieter because the maxies
dominate i'd like to talk a little bit
about the unusual aspects of your life
and not because we're celebrity chasing
or naval gazing here but because it
points towards where you can live your
life right one unusual thing about your
life is that you don't seem to have
large collections of houses and cars and
you're not doing the standard wealth
thing another is you're still working as
this leader of this decentralized
organization you speak some very large
number of languages would you mind
giving us an idea a week in the life of
vitalik or a monthly life of italic and
it might be interesting to look at where
it's different than the normal person's
life
the last six months of my life i was in
san francisco toronto argentina costa
rica mexico singapore so a big long
assortment of places i've been a nomad
for about eight years now i started
doing that as part of my bitcoin trip in
2013 and then ethereum started and it's
like my bitcoin trip never stopped i
just kept on going to different places
because i was the person that was
willing to travel to any particular
events to talk to people people just
kept on piling more places for me to
visit eventually that part of my
lifestyle just became permanent and
you've given away ridiculous amounts of
money right if everyone correctly had
seven founders and you've probably been
among the most generous of them do you
plan on giving it all away or most of it
away does money not matter to you
i plan on putting the money towards
things that are the most important and
meaningful to the world how many
languages do you speak it depends on
what count somewhere between four and
six and pretty fluently right i saw you
on an airplane once speaking fluent
chinese
which caught me off guard a little bit
was that something you learned recently
well chinese over the last five years
english and russian i grew up with
french who learned in school and chinese
and then some german and some spanish i
was gonna ask you said you're still on
your bitcoin trip when is your bitcoin
trip going to be finished it might never
be a few years ago i thought that i
would settle down eventually but then
during covet i spent about six months in
singapore and i realized that wow at
this point my brain is rewired and i'm
just not meant to stay in one place the
nomadic is probably never going to end
it was liberating realizing that i'm off
the standard track for good and i'm fine
with that
i got one last question which will be
useful for my audience a lot of people
who listen to these kinds of podcasts
they're just trying to be the best
version of themselves whether it's the
happiest or the most successful or the
healthiest or the fittest and i'm
wondering if you have any philosophy
that helps you make decisions that you
think contributed to where you are today
the conscious philosophy where you're
like should i put time into my own
education or should i travel or what
have you is there any advice you would
have for a young person who's sort of
going down the standard track the
standard track as i went to high school
i go to college i get a degree then i
got a job blah blah blah is there any
advice you would give them given where
the world is today and what you have
learned strive to be a better person at
the end of every week than you were at
the beginning of it what better means
can be very different it could mean
learn something it could be an exercise
and get better at running than you were
before it could mean improving your
ability to interact positively with
other people it could mean try something
new visit a country that you haven't
visited before and add some experience
live every week so you don't feel like
at the end of the week you've wasted it
keep on moving forward and you'll be
fine
don't live life on autopilot
i'll see if you got any closing
questions or remarks or thoughts
i know that i'm not alone in saying that
the crypto world owes you an enormous
debt and having moved it forward there's
a great man theory of history that feels
more and more outdated over time but
you're one of the few examples of a
living person who has
massively and single-handedly moved
forward history and i know it probably
is difficult for you to have the sense
of everything that ethereum has done in
the world and feel it but i can tell you
that all of us owe an enormous amount of
what we're doing with our lives to what
you started
i would echo that by saying it was
remarkable how young you are and you're
already a multi-act person because you
contributed significantly to telling
people about bitcoin you contributed
obviously by creating eth and then
you've also contributed through the
creation of unit swap and amms and now
pushing social recovery wallets and
privacy and so on you have a multi-act
career in front of you and i look
forward to seeing the future acts as you
were talking about improve every week
that's compound interest and compound
interest is a function of number of
iterations not time so as you keep
iterating and iterating i'm curious to
see the vitalik that comes out the other
side and the huge huge impact that he
has and honestly for someone like you
politics is a waste of time and yes you
have to engage in it because you have to
coordinate people but i'm sure at some
point you're going to have some great
idea and this time instead of having to
create yourself against all odds you'll
be able to recruit a great team and
finance them and shepherd them into
building something as impactful in a
parallel domain so looking forward to
that i know you do a lot of these we try
to make it a little different keep it a
little more high level keep it a little
more timeless you're tireless on the
podcast circuit so thanks again and hope
to be helpful to you in the ethereum
community
