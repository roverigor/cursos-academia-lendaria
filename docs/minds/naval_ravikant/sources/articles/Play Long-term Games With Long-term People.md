I like a little bit about what
industries you should think about
working in what kind of job you should
have and who you might want to work with
so you said one should pick an industry
where you can play long-term games with
long term people why yeah this is an
insight into what makes Silicon Valley
work and what makes high trust societies
work essentially all the benefits in
life come from compound interests
whether it's in relationships or making
money or in learning so compound
interest is a marvelous force where it's
like you know you start out with one X
what you have and then if you increased
20% a year for 30 years it's not that
you got 30 years times 20% added on it
was compounding so it just grew grew and
grew until you suddenly got a massive
amount of whatever it is whether it's
goodwill or love or relationships or
money so I think compound interest is a
very important force so you have to be
able to play a long-term game and
long-term games are good not just for
compound interest they're also good for
trust if you look at prisoner's dilemma
type games the solution to prisoner's
dilemma is tit for tat which is I'm just
gonna do to you what you did last time
to me with some forgiveness in case
there was a mistake made but that only
works in an iterated prisoner's dilemma
in other words if we play the game
multiple times so if you're in a
situation like for example you're in
Silicon Valley for people doing business
with each other and they know each other
they trust each other then they do right
by each other because they know this
person will be around for the next game
now of course that doesn't always work
because you can make so much money in
one move in Silicon Valley
sometimes people betray each other
because they're just like I'm gonna get
rich enough of office that I don't care
so there can be exceptions to all these
circumstances but essentially if you
want to be successful you have to work
with other people and you have to figure
out who can you trust and who can you
trust
over a long long period of time that you
can just keep playing the game with them
so that compound interest in high trust
will make it easy to play the game and
will let you collect the major rewards
which are usually at the end of the
cycle so for example Warren Buffett has
done really well as an investor in the
US stock market but the biggest reason
he could do that was because the US
stock market has been stable and around
and didn't get for example seized by the
government during a bad administration
or the US didn't plunge in some war
the underlying platform didn't get
destroyed so in his case he was playing
a long-term game and the trust came from
the US stock market stability in Silicon
Valley the trust comes from the network
of people in the small geographic area
that you figure out over time who you
can work with who you can if you keep
switching locations you keep switching
groups let's say you started out in the
woodworking industry and you build up a
network there and you're working hard
you're trying to build a product and
woodworking industry and then suddenly
another industry comes along that's
adjacent but different but you don't
really know anybody in it and you want
to dive in and make money there if you
keep hopping from industry you know
actually I need to open a line of
electric car stations for electric car
refueling that might make sense it might
be the best opportunity but every time
you reset every time you wander out of
where you built your network you're
gonna be starting from scratch you're
not gonna know who to trust they're not
gonna trust you they're also industries
in which people are transient by
definition they're always coming in and
going out politics is an example of that
right in politics new people are being
elected you see in politics that when
you have a lot of old-timers like the
Senate people have been around for a
long time and they've been career
politicians yeah they love them downside
the career politicians the corruption
but an upside is they actually get deals
done with each other because they know
the other person is gonna be in the same
position 10 years from now and they have
to keep dealing with them so they might
as well learn how to cooperate where's
every time you get like a new incoming
freshman class in the House of
Representatives which turns over every
two years a big wave election nothing
gets done because a lot of fighting
because I just got here I don't know you
I don't know if you're gonna be around
why should I work with you rather than
just try and do whatever I think is
right so it's important to pick an
industry where you can play long-term
games and with long-term people so those
people have to signal that they're gonna
be around for a long time that they're
ethical and their ethics are visible
through their actions in a long-term
game it seems that everybody is making
each other rich and in a short-term game
it seems like everybody is making
themselves rich I think that is a
brilliant formulation yeah in a
long-term game it's positive some we're
all baking the playa together we're
trying to make it as big as possible in
a short-term game we're cutting up the
pie now this is not to excuse the
socialist
- right the Socialists the people who
are not involved in baking the pie who
show up at the end and say I want a
slice or I want the whole pie they show
with the guns but I think a good leader
doesn't take credit a good leader
basically tries to inspire people's that
the team gets the job done and then
things get divided up according to
fairness and who contributed how much or
as close to it as possible and took a
risk as opposed to just whoever has the
longest not the sharpest knives at the
end so these next two tweets are play
iterated games all returns in life
whether in wealth relationships or
knowledge come from compound interest
yeah when you have been doing business
with somebody you've been friends with
somebody for 10 years 20 years 30 years
it just gets better and better because
you trust them so easy if the friction
goes down you can do bigger and bigger
things together for example you know
simplest one is getting married to
someone having kids and raising children
like that's compound interest right
investing in those relationships those
relations and look be invaluable
compared to more casual relationships
it's true in health and fitness you know
the fitter you are the easier it is to
stay fit where's the more you'd
deteriorate your body the harder it is
to come back and claw your way back to a
baseline
it requires heroic acts regarding
compound interest I think I saw you
retweet something a while back maybe it
was from Edie
Lattimore it was something along the
lines of get some traction get purchase
and don't lose it so the idea was to
gain some initial attraction and never
fall back just keep ratcheting up and up
I remembered exactly but I think that
was right yeah was that get traction and
don't let go it was a good one yeah
