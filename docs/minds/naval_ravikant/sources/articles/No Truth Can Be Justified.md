the initial guesses at what knowledge
was all about amounted to what is known
as the justified true belief vision of
knowledge and it's still the most
prevalent idea today anyone who calls
themselves a bayesian is a justified
true believer and that's the
misconception that knowledge is about
trying to justify as true your beliefs
and if you've done so then you can say i
know that thing so if i can justify as
true
my theory of gravity then i should
believe that theory of gravity and only
then can i say that it's known
the problem with this is that there is
no method of showing as true
any piece of knowledge so the
improvement deutsch promotes in his
books is this vision that popper gave us
that
all we have are guesses about reality
conjectures people think oh that sounds
a bit wishy-washy it's just a guess well
it's not a random guess it's not just
anyone decides to have a guess and
therefore that stands on equal footing
to every other no it's a guess that has
stood up against trials against attempts
to show that it's false and when people
are unable to show that it's false via
this method of refutation then we accept
it as a piece of knowledge
this allows us to thereby
accept the fact that we're going to be
able to make progress in the future
because all of our knowledge is
conjectural all of it is our best guess
at the time and therefore there's this
elasticity within the knowledge that
allows us to say there's going to be
errors we're going to correct them and
thereby be able to make progress off
into the infinite future this is unlike
the previous conception of knowledge
which says once you've justified
something is true well it's true
if it's true that means there is nothing
false about it and therefore it can't
possibly be refuted it's a very
religious notion the modern incantation
of this is bayesianism bayesianism says
you have a theory you collect more
evidence and you become more and more
confident over time that your theory is
correct and it gets a little bit worse
than that because then it says this
bayesian reasoning enables you to
generate new theories which you can't
the best that it can hope to do is to
show you that you are more confident in
this theory than what you are in that
theory the poperian view says if you can
show that there's a flaw in a particular
theory you can discard that theory
