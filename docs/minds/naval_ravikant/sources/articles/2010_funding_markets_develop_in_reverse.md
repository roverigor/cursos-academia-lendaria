Naval explains how funding ecosystems develop in a counterintuitive way.

### Key Insights

1. **In emerging markets, funding first goes to the most stable companies that "least need funding"** - those with:
   - Strong operating histories
   - Auditable financials
   - Predictable cash flows

2. **Funding progression typically follows this order:**
   - Public markets
   - Mezzanine investors
   - Late-stage private investors
   - Seed incubators
   - Angel investors

3. **The primary investor risk is "downstream financing risk"** - whether a company can raise additional funds after initial investment.

4. **For entrepreneurs in locations with limited funding:**
   - Two primary options exist:
     - a) Bootstrap to demonstrate financial returns
     - b) Relocate headquarters to a funding hub

## Core Quote

> "The problem, as I've come to realize, is that funding markets develop in reverse."

### Entrepreneurial Advice

Carefully evaluate your location's funding ecosystem before establishing a startup. Areas with few VCs likely have limited angel investment opportunities.
