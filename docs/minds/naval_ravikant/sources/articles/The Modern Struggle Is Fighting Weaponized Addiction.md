in some very deep level all pleasure
creates its own offsetting pain and fear
of loss on the other side I had a tweet
recently where I said in an age of
abundance pursuing pleasure for its own
sake creates addiction a miyamoto
musashi line do not pursue pleasure for
its own sake Musashi and use a Japanese
swordsman in his time when you pursued
pleasure it might mean a very different
thing he didn't have unlimited processed
food he didn't have internet pornography
marijuana or alcohol available on demand
now that we're an age of abundance if we
pursue pleasurable things directly for
their own sake we land into addiction
very easily which is hard to get out of
I think the modern struggle is really
about alone individuals disconnected
from their tribe disconnected from their
religions disconnected from their
cultural networks trying to stand up to
all these things that have been
weaponized alcohol drugs pornography
processed foods news media internet
social media video games with these
things you can basically engage in fake
play and fake work before you would have
to go socialize with your friends and I
just get drunk with a bunch of strangers
and it's easy and good before you would
have had to go find a mate and have sex
and create children and raise a family
now you just watch a lot of porn before
you might have needed to go climb trees
and hunt and get fruit for a little bit
of natural sweetness and I can aspire
all the gelato that you want the modern
struggle not only is trying to stand up
to these things that are weaponized that
are giving you small doses of pleasure
but desensitizing you and exposing you
to the misery of their loss in their
absence
