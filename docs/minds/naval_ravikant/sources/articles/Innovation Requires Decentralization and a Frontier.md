innovation requires a couple of things
one of the things that it seems to
requires decentralization i don't think
it's a coincidence that the athenian
city-states the italian city-states or
even the united states when it was more
free form and less federal government
control or hotbeds of innovation because
you had lots and lots of competition
people could switch from one state to
another if their ideas weren't welcome
and there was a robust competition of
ideas the real diversity that matters is
diversity of ideas and that diversity of
skin color and you also need a frontier
you need something new to explore either
an intellectual frontier or physical
frontier we've occupied california if
anything now california is the
institution the establishment no longer
the front of the wild west maybe we need
one in space maybe we need intellectual
ones like we have in cryptocurrencies
and it's the nature of wild west's that
they're always filled with scammers
they're always filled with crimes
they're always filled with very strange
and odd things because they tend to
attract a weird crowd but at the same
time it is where a lot of the innovation
is going on i see a lot of lamenting
from old school scientists and
entrepreneurs where are the new
entrepreneurs welcome i think paul
graham tweeted this the other day he's
the y combinator founder brilliant guy
he said something along the lines of
steve jobs today wouldn't be able to get
a job or wouldn't be able to survive at
a silicon valley company he'd be
canceled by his own team but steve jobs
today would be in crypto he'd be in
crypto with all the scammers and all the
criminals and all the weirdos but at
least there he'd have a space to be
weird he'd have a place to be different
he'd have a place to try new things
without having to constantly answer to
someone there's a pendulum between
centralization and decentralization for
example if you look at the crypto world
centralized finance ends up very
ossified you have the government and the
regulators telling you exactly what you
can and can't do you get regulatory
capture next thing you know wall street
is sucking 20 of the profits out of the
economy and crypto can replace that so
you get decentralization pressure where
people can do it in a free-form
programmatic way but then you end up
with a lot more scams and fraud and
losses as well
in old times you worry about brigands
and robbers in the forest so you appeal
to the king while the king builds a nice
keep the king mints the money but next
thing you know the king is debasing the
currency and the king is throwing people
in jail then some people run off into
the forest they become brigands again
because they want their freedom but now
of course they're subject to attacks and
harassment from their peers so there's
natural pendulum swing that goes on
history between centralization and
decentralization and i think the arc of
technology actually swung us towards
centralization in the last decade i'm a
big fan of amazon but it's a very
centralized entity there's a
decentralization arc that is taking
place even in that industry things like
shopify that are coming up enabling
small stores to compete or even local
delivery services like doordash they're
centralized services but they're
allowing a decentralized army of
restaurants and local shops to compete
against centralized services so we're
going to see this arc going back and
forth
