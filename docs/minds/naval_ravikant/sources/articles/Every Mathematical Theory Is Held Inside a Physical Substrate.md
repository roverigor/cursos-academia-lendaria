there goes my solution for zeno's
paradox which is before you can get all
the way somewhere you have to get
halfway there and before you can get
halfway there you have to get a quarter
of the way there and therefore you'll
never get there
one way to get past that is say even a
series of infinite
things can have a finite sum just run
the infinite series and summit
and we learn pretty early on that
converges but another thought i had was
that
you have to cover a minimum distance a
plank length and therefore you will get
there it's a finite series of steps but
you're saying we just don't know
yes so if the laws of physics say that
we can cover one meter in a certain time
period then that's exactly what we'll do
and our current understanding of the
laws of physics say precisely that so
zeno's paradox is resolved simply by
saying that
we can cover this space in this amount
of time it's silent on whether or not
space is infinitely divisible when
someone asks you
is space infinitely divisible then i
would say yes it is and they might turn
around and say how do you know and i
would say general relativity
how do i know that's true well i don't
know that it's true however
it is the best explanation that we
presently have
of space-time and then they might get
into a discussion about well if it's
infinitely divisible then you're
presented with zeno's paradox all over
again
and i would say no you refute that by a
simple experiment so we don't know how
it is
that we can travel through all of these
infinite points if in fact there are
infinite points
xeno's paradox is about the domain of
pure mathematics but we don't live in a
world of pure mathematics we live in a
world of
physics and if the physics says that we
can transverse an
infinite number of points in a finite
amount of time then that's what we'll do
regardless of what the mathematics is
every mathematical theory is held inside
a physical substrate of a brain or a
computer
you're always bound by the laws of
physics and these pure abstract domains
may have no mapping to reality
