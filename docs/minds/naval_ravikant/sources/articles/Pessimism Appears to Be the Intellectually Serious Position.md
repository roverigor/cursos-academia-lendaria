if you're an academic of some kind then
being able to explain
all of the problems that are out there
and how dangerous these problems are and
why you need
funding in order to look at these
problems in more depth
that appears to be the intellectually
serious position someone who claims that
we can solve this it sounds a little bit
kumbaya even though it's quite right
that in fact collaboration cooperation
and resource exploitation will actually
be the thing that's going to drive this
the knowledge economy forward so that we
can solve these problems it always seems
more intellectually serious if you can
stand up there with a frown on your face
in front of a ted talk audience and say
these are all the ways in which we're
going to fail and which we're going to
come to ruin
i'm guilty of having recorded one of
these doomsayer podcasts about enders
blowing up the earth
but that was the one podcast that i
regretted the most
we had a great conversation but i don't
fundamentally agree with any of the
conclusions that might come out of that
which say the world is going to end so
we should slow down
the only way out is through progress and
subsequently i haven't promoted as much
as i promoted my other podcast
and upon reading deutsch i realize why
it's because it's easy to be a pessimist
it's an easy trap to fall into
but it implies that humans are not
creative it doesn't acknowledge
all the ways that we have innovated our
way out of previous traps and
fundamentally
entrepreneurs are inherently optimistic
because they get rewarded for being
optimistic
as you're saying intellectuals get
rewarded for being pessimistic
so there is always a lot of incentive
bias here
as an academic you may be incented to be
pessimistic
as an entrepreneur you may be incented
to be optimistic if you're a pessimist
you get your feedback from other people
it's a social act you're convincing
other people of your pessimism
and so far most of their pessimistic
predictions have turned out to be false
if you look at any timelines on which
the world was supposed to end
or environmental catastrophes were
supposed to happen they've been quite
wrong
but if you look at the optimistic
entrepreneurs
they are rated by feedback from nature
and free markets which i believe
are much more realistic feedback
mechanisms
