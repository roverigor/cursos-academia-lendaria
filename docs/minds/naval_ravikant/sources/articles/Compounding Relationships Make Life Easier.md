we talked about compounding and
compounding interest but we didn't
really dig into it that much
relationships are a good example of
compound interest once you've been in a
good relationship with somebody for a
while whether it's business or it's
romantic life just gets a lot easier
because you know that person's got your
back you don't have to keep questioning
if I'm doing a deal with someone that
I've dealt with for 20 years and I trust
them and they trust me we don't have to
read the legal contracts maybe we don't
even need to create legal contracts
maybe we can actually do it on
handshakes that kind of trust makes it
very very easy to do business if nivi
and I start another company I know that
if things aren't working out we're both
gonna be extremely reasonable about how
to go about it how to exit out of it how
to shut it down or even if we're scaling
and how to bring in new people because
at this point we have mutual trust and
that allows us to start businesses more
easily and almost compounds the effect
especially when you're dealing with
something like a start-up which is so
difficult to pull off removing these
frictional mechanisms can actually often
be the difference between success and
failure I think the number one most
under-recognized
reason why startups fail is because the
founders fall apart there's a couple
somewhat non-intuitive things about
compounding the first one is that most
of the benefits of compounding comes at
the end of the compounding so you may
not necessarily see the huge benefits of
it upfront the other thing I would say
that's a little non-intuitive about
compounding is that I think it's better
to have a few deep compounding
relationships with people instead of a
large amount of non compounding
relationships there was a good quote
from an article that Sam Altman wrote
where he said I always want it to be a
project that if successful will make the
rest of my career look like a footnote
again that just goes back to the idea
that most of the benefits of compounding
come at the end I think one of the under
realized things in business is that it
takes just as much effort to create a
small business as it does to create a
large business whether you're Yvonne
Musk or whether you're the guy running
three Italian restaurants in town you're
working 80 hours a week you're sweating
bullets you're hiring
firing people you're trying to balance
the books it's highly stressful and it
takes years and years of your life but
in one case you get companies that are
worth fifty hundred billion dollars and
the adulation of everybody and the other
hand you might make a little bit of
money and you've got some nice
restaurants so think big
