i think stephen hawking himself said
that it was a mistake to broadcast radio
waves out into the universe because the
aliens are going to be out there and
they're going to be like conquistadors
and they're going to want to take over
our planet for their resources and
various other things there's a couple of
responses you can have to the idea of
evil aliens coming to get us the first
of which is the only way to make
progress
off into the infinite future to have the
technologies that would enable you to
traverse the galaxy is to have this
vision of knowledge that popper had
namely that you are freely able to
explore the space of ideas
able to falsify assumptions and to not
have centralized authorities and force
being used on people which dampens down
creativity to have a maximally creative
society you have to have freedom you
have to have liberty and therefore you
will have a non-violent society you will
have a society which values creativity
as an end in itself when we encounter
the aliens we should expect not that
they're going to be immoral bastards
that are going to want to take over our
resources but the opposite they're going
to look at us and think what primitive
savages we are they're going to think
that we're moral midgets and they're
going to want to teach us they're not
going to want to put us in prison or
anything like that because knowledge is
a unified whole if their physics is so
much better than ours which enables them
to approach the speed of light or to use
some weird general relativity gravity
thing that creates a wormhole so they
can get through space
faster than the speed of light all of
their sciences are going to be so much
further ahead all of their knowledge is
going to be further ahead their
mathematics their morality their
political institutions so we don't have
to worry about the aliens and by the way
we don't have to worry about their
stealing our resources that's not like
they're going to go ah there's a planet
full of coal and water we're going to
take it no they're going to have the
knowledge to be able to sweep up the
hydrogen in intergalactic space and turn
that into a fusion reactor and use 3d
printing to create any technology that
they want and in fact that might be
another answer to the fermi paradox they
don't need to leave their local area
because they've already got the
technology to perfectly sustain them in
a relatively small region of space yeah
they've got dyson spheres they can
gather all the energy they need they can
gather all the matter they can create
anything they want and they can have any
reality in vr space that they want so
literally the only thing that they would
be lacking
is new knowledge that they don't have
it's literally the only thing they would
be lacking
