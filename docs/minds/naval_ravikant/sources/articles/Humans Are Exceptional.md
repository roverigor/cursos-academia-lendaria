three out of these four theories have an
interesting pattern to them with good
explanations in epistemology we're
saying conjectures and their refutations
and error correction is how we improve
knowledge with genetic evolution genetic
mutations variation and natural
selections weeds out the ones that
didn't work and then there's mimetic
evolution on top of that where we have
ideas and then criticism weeds out the
ideas that don't work related to that in
invention there's trial and error or in
capitalism startups get created and the
ones that have bad ideas fail so we see
this pattern recurring over and over
what's interesting though is another
meta pattern here and the matter pattern
here is that humans are exceptional
in epistemology humans are the only
non-bayesian reasoners in evolution
humans are the only memetic creatures
that we know of
in the theory of computation humans are
the only universal explainers that we
know of other than of course the
computers that we've invented so what's
interesting is that science took us from
this view of humans being at the center
of the universe to be actually humans
are nothing special you're just one
little planet out of an almost infinite
number of now kepler-like planets that
could be bearing life out there but
three of these four theories that we're
talking about are pointing us in this
direction of humans are extremely
exceptional humans are capable of
maximal knowledge one interesting
realization for me was that
even if you were god even if you had
infinite knowledge and power even if you
control the entire universe
you still wouldn't know
you're not in a simulation you still
could never prove that you're not in the
simulation
and even as a god there's no concept
that you could hold in your head that a
human being couldn't hold unless of
course the laws of physics are different
if the laws of physics are different
then all bets are off who knows but
working within the current laws of
physics humans are capable of maximum
knowledge of maximum awareness and that
points to a world where humans are
exceptional and not just another form of
bacteria that got out of control and
overran this planet a lot of these
fundamental theories lead to a viewpoint
that humans are special that knowledge
is infinite and as long as we don't
destroy the means of error correction
and we're always creating new knowledge
then there's good reason to be
optimistic
