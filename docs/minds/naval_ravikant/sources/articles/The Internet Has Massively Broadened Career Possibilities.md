let's look at this next tweet which I
thought was cryptic and also super
interesting about the kind of job or
career that you might have you said the
Internet has massively broaden the
possible space of careers most people
haven't figured this out yet the
fundamental property of the internet
more than any other single thing is it
connects every human to each other human
on the planet
you can now reach everyone whether it's
by emailing them personally
lettuce by broadcasting to them on
Twitter whether it's by posting
something on Facebook that they find
whether it's by putting up a website
they come in access it connects everyone
to everyone so the Internet is an inter
networking tool it connects everybody
that is its superpower so you want to
use that what that helps you figure out
is that the internet means that you can
find your audience for your product or
your talent and skill no matter how far
away they are for example may not who's
illustrators if he was in these videos
pre-internet
how would we get the message out there
it would just be what would he do he
would run around where he lives in his
neighborhood showing it to people on a
computer or a screen or he would try to
get it plated with local movie theater
it was impossible it only works because
he can put it on the internet and then
how many people in the world are really
interested in it or even interested in
what we're talking about really gonna
absorb it right it's gonna be a very
small subset of humanity
the key is being able to reach them so
what the Internet does is allows any
niche obsession which could be just the
weirdest thing it could be like people
who collect snakes so like people who
like to ride hot-air balloons the people
who like to sail around the world by
themselves just one person on a craft or
someone who's obsessed with miniature
cooking like there's this whole Japanese
major cooking phenomenon or there's a
show about a woman goes in people's
houses and tidies it up right so
whatever niche obsession you have the
Internet allows of a scale now that's
not to say that what you build will be
the next Facebook of reach billions of
users but if you just want to reach
50,000 passionate people like you
there's an audience out there for you so
the beauty of this is that we have 7
billion beings on this planet
the combinatoric some human DNA are
incredible everyone is completely
different you'll never meet any two
people who are even vaguely similar to
each other that can substitute for each
other it's not you can say well maybe
just left my life so I can have
this other person come in and he's just
like maybe and I get the same feelings
let's say in responses and the same
ideas no there are no substitutes for
people people are completely unique so
given that each person has different
skill sets different interests different
obsessions and it's that diversity that
becomes a creative superpower so each
person can be creatively superb at their
own unique thing but before that didn't
matter because if you were living a
little fishing village in Italy like
your fishing village didn't naturally
need your completely unique skill and
you had to conform to just a few jobs
that were available but now today you
can be completely unique you can go out
on the internet and you can find your
audience and you can build a business
and create a product and build wealth
and make people happy just uniquely
expressing yourself through the internet
space of careers has been so broaden
eSports players you know people making
millions of dollars playing Fortnight
people creating videos and upload them
and YouTube broadcasters bloggers you
know a podcast with Joe Rogan and I read
true or false I don't know but I read
that he's gonna make about a hundred
million dollars a year on his podcast
and he's had 2 billion downloads even
PewDiePie is a hilarious tweet that i
retweeted the other day PewDiePie is the
number one trusted name in news this is
a kid I think in Sweden and he's got
three times the distribution of the top
cable news networks just on his news
channel it's not even on his
entertainment channel the internet
enables any niche interest as long as
you're the best at it to scale out and
the great news is because every human is
different everyone is the best at
something you being themselves another
tweet I have that is worth kind of
weaving in but didn't go into this tweet
storm it was a very simple one I like
things when they can compress them down
because they're easy to remember it easy
to hook on to but that one was escape
competition through authenticity
so basically when you're competing with
people it's because you're copying them
it's because you're trying to do the
same thing but every human is different
don't copy I know where magnetic
creatures and rené girard has an old
nemesis theory but it's much easier than
that don't imitate don't copy just do
your own thing no one can compete with
you on being you it's that simple and so
the more authentic you are to who you
are and what you love to do the less
competition you're gonna have
you can escape competition through
authenticity when you realize that no
one can compete with you on being you
and normally that would have been
useless advice pre-internet
post-internet you can turn that into a
career
