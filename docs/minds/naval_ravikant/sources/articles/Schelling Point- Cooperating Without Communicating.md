let's talk about the shelling point
shelling point is a game theory concept
made famous by Thomas Schelling
in the book called strategy of conflict
which I do recommend reading and it's
about multiplayer games where other
people are responding based on what they
think your responses what he came up
with was the mathematical formalization
of how do you get people who cannot
communicate with each other to
coordinate suppose that I want to meet
with you but I don't tell you where and
I don't tell you when we both want to
meet but we cannot communicate any more
information to each other that would
sound like an impossible problem to
solve we're done we can't do it
not quite because I know that you're a
rational person and smart and educated
and you know I'm a rational person who's
smart we're gonna start thinking well if
we have to pick an arbitrary date we're
probably gonna pick new years and what
time midnight or 12:01 a.m. and where
would we meet what is a big meeting
point well if we're Americans is
probably in New York City it's the most
important city and we're in New York
City will be meet at midnight probably
Grand Central Station under the clock
maybe you end up at the Empire State
Building but not likely so you can just
use social norms to converge in this
case on to a shelling point and there
are many times in many games where you
can look at the game itself whether it's
business or art or politics and you can
find the converging shelling point
within the context of that game and so
you can cooperate with the other person
here's a simple example let's suppose
that you have two companies that are
competing heavily with each other and
they hold an oligopoly and let's say
that they're competing right now and the
price fluctuates between 8 bucks and 12
bucks for whatever the service is don't
be surprised if they both converge on 10
bucks without ever talking to each other
