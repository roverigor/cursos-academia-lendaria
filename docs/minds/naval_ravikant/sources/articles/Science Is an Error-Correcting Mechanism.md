so getting back to good explanations
where do these explanations come from
there's currently an obsession with
induction induction being the idea
that you can predict the future from the
past you can say
i saw one then two then three then four
then five so therefore next must be six
seven
eight nine there's a belief that this is
how new knowledge is created this is how
scientific theories are formed
and this is how we can make good
explanations about the universe
what's wrong with induction and where
does new knowledge
come from you did mention the black swan
earlier and i'd like to go back to that
the black swan
is an example that various people have
used over the years
in order to illustrate this idea that
repeatedly observing the same phenomena
over and again should not make you
confident that it will continue in the
future
in europe we have white swan so any
biologist
who's interested in birds be observing
white swan after white swan
and apparently concluding on that basis
that therefore all swans are white
then someone travels to western
australia and there you notice that
there are swans
that otherwise look identical to the
ones in europe but they're black
let's consider another example of
induction ever since the beginning of
your life
you have observed that the sun has risen
does this mean that scientifically you
should conclude the sun will rise
tomorrow
and rise every day after that this is
not what science is about
science is not about cataloging a
history of events that have occurred in
the past
and presuming they're going to occur
again in the future science is an
explanatory
framework it's an error correcting
mechanism it's not
ever of the form the sun always rose in
the past therefore arise in the future
there's all sorts of ways in which we
can imagine the sun won't rise tomorrow
all you need to do is to take a trip to
antarctica and there for some months of
the year the sun doesn't rise at all
if you go to the international space
station you won't see the sun rise once
per day and set once per day
it will rise and set repeatedly over the
course of your very fast journey around
the earth
