I think when you're being authentic you
don't really mind competition that much
yeah it pisses you off and inspire us
some fear and jealousy and all the other
emotions that come along with it but
also you don't really mind because
you're more oriented towards the goal
and the mission and worst case you get
some ideas from them and there's often
ways to work with the competition in a
positive way and it ends up increasing
the size of the market for you yeah
sometimes it depends on the nature of
the business Silicon Valley tech
industry businesses tend to be
winner-take-all at least the good ones
and so when you see competition it can
make you fly into a rage because it
really does endanger everything you've
built whereas if I was opening a
restaurant and a more interesting
version the same restaurant opens up in
a different town that's fantastic I'm
just gonna lift from them what's working
and drop what I can see that they have
already figured out is not working so it
does depend to some extent on the nature
of the business that said even the
businesses that seem like that they are
often in direct competition really
aren't they can end up adjacent or
slightly different you're one step away
from a completely different business and
sometimes you need to take that one step
and you're not gonna be able to take it
if you're busy fighting over a booby
prize kind of you're playing stupid
gaming and I win a stupid prize it's not
obvious right now because you're blinded
by competition but three years from now
it'll be obvious to give a simple
example when I was first starting
companies one of my first ones was
called opinions which was an online
product review site for all the products
out there that was independent of Amazon
and that space eventually turned into
TripAdvisor and Yelp which is where we
should have gone we should have done
more local reviews because there's more
value to having a review of a scarce
item like in your local restaurant there
is of an item like a camera which was
gonna have a thousand reviews on Amazon
but before we could get there we got
caught up in the whole comparison
shopping game and so we ended up merging
with deal time and we competed with my
Simon and bizrate which became Shopzilla
and PriceGrabber and next tag and a
whole bunch of these price comparison
engines and we're all caught in fierce
competition with each other and that
whole space went to zero because it
turns out Amazon 1e tail completely so
there was no need for price comparison
everyone just went to Amazon but
we got the booby prize because we were
caught in a competition with a bunch of
our peers when really we should have
been looking at what the consumer really
wanted and being authentic to ourselves
which was reviews in that price
comparison and gone more and more into
more and more esoteric items that needed
to be reviewed where customers had less
and less data and wanted reviews more
badly so if we'd stayed authentic to
ourselves we would have done better
