there was a story on itv in the uk and
they were talking about how much
supposed waste that amazon produces that
amazon was destroying a whole bunch of
products regularly routinely
and i thought why are these people
inserting their opinion into a business
that they know absolutely nothing about
what would they prefer would they prefer
amazon to have the impossible namely
perfect knowledge of precisely how many
products need to be made in other words
an epistemologically impossible
situation to be in or would they prefer
that amazon made insufficient products
so the people who wanted to purchase
them weren't actually able to get hold
of them what amazon of course does is
make slightly more than what they need
that's what happens in any business they
make slightly more than what they need
now and again i once had a venture
capitalist argue to me that there were
too many kinds of shoes and it was an
example of how capitalism had failed
because nobody needs as many kinds of
sneakers and clearly overshadowed
society my question to him was when did
you know that there were too many shoes
what's the point in history where we
decide there's too many shoes where
before that we need more shoes because
we need more stretchy shoes we need more
durable shoes we need thicker sole shoes
we need lighter shoes we need all kinds
of amazing shoe innovation and then at
some point somebody decides now we have
enough shoes now we need to kill all the
other shoe lines where did you come up
with this idea that you just happen to
be born in the right time in the right
place to identify that yes we have
enough shoes this is a certain
parochialism that everyone falls into
there's a more macro version of that
which is we're running out of resources
philosophy and it starts with the earth
is finite there's this finite set of
resources we're running out and we're
consuming them all and therefore we're
all going to die if we don't tamp back
our consumption first of all how did you
decide it was the earth how did you
decide that your town wasn't running out
of resources why wasn't the town
the actual area that you wanted to save
and then everything outside of that was
foreign and unreachable why draw the
boundary around the earth we could go to
the solar system we could go to the
galaxy we could go to the universe we
could go to the multiverse there's a lot
of resources out there if you know how
to harness them and then how do you
define what a resource is a resource is
just something that through knowledge
you can convert from one thing to
another so there was a time when coal
wasn't a resource iron wasn't a resource
to a caveman very few things or
resources just a few edible plants and a
few edible animals and that's it but
domestication harvesting crops
metallurgy chemistry physics developing
engines and rockets all of these are
things that are taking things that we
thought were worthless and turn them to
resources uranium has gone from being
completely worthless to being an
incredible resource so this finite
resource model of the world
implicitly assumes finite knowledge it
says knowledge creation has come to an
end we are stuck at this current point
and therefore based on the knowledge
that we have currently these are all the
resources available to us now we must
start conserving but knowledge is the
thing that we can always create more of
