now you're pointing out a minority
opinion there i think culture is still
stuck in the
second part of what you were saying
originally we thought that we were at
the center of the universe this was the
religious conception of man's place in
the cosmos the earth was surrounded by
the celestial spheres and everything was
orbiting around the earth so we were the
inheritors of the entire universe and
god had gifted us with this and then
science showed us that in fact we're not
at a particularly special place in the
universe this is the cosmological
principle this idea that the universe is
roughly the same at every single place
and we are just one of those
particularly unspecial places and not
only are we unspecial in the
cosmological sense but biologically
we're nothing particularly special we're
just on the continuum between bacterias
to cockroaches through to dogs and
chimpanzees and astrophysics absolutely
love on almost every other topic neil
degrasse tyson he was talking about how
chimpanzees are a lot smarter than what
we think and chimpanzees might be
thinking about all sorts of stuff and
we're just not that much better so this
is what almost everyone thinks
but this third view that a lot of us are
trying to promote now is that it's not a
slight quantitative difference between
chimpanzees and us there is a continuum
between bacteria to cockroaches to dogs
and chimpanzees but we're off axis we
are qualitatively different and all you
need to do is open your eyes you look
out your window and you look at that
beautiful city that happens to be out
there that cannot be explained by this
gradual increase of biological
complexity
