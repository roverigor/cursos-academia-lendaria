the last tweet on the topic of working
for the long term is that when you're
finally wealthy you'll realize that it
wasn't what you were seeking in the
first place but that's for another day
that's a multi-hour topic in of itself
first of all I thought it was a really
clever way to end the whole thing
because it disarms a whole set of people
who'd say well yeah what's the point of
getting rich
because there are a lot of people who
just like the status signal virtue
signal against the idea of wealth
creation or making money so it was just
a good way to disarm all of them but
it's also true in that the things that
you really want in life yes money will
solve all your money problems but it
doesn't get you everywhere the first
thing you'll realize when you've made a
bunch of money is that you're still the
same person if you're happy you're happy
if you're unhappy you're unhappy if
you're calm and fulfilled and peaceful
you're still that same person I know
lots of very rich people who are
extremely out of shape I know lots of
rich people who have really bad family
lives I know lots of rich people who are
internally a mess so I would lean on
another tweet that I put out which is
actually when I think back on it I think
it's my favorite tweet of mine it's not
initially the most insightful it's not
nearly the most helpful it's not even
the one I think about the most but I
just went to look at it there's just
such a certain truth in there that it
just resonates and that is that a calm
mind a fit body and a house full of love
these things cannot be bought they must
be earned even if you have all the money
in the world you can't have those three
things Jeff Bezos still has to work out
he still has to work on his marriage or
whatever his next relationship is and
his internal mental state is still gonna
be very much not controlled by external
events it's gonna be based on how calm
and peaceful he's inside so I think
those three things your health your
mental health and your close
relationships are things that you have
to cultivate and can probably bring you
a lot more peace and happiness than any
amount of money ever will so that's what
I meant now how to get there is actually
a tweet storm that I still need to put
out I've been working on it I have
probably a hundred tweets on it it's
just very hard to say anything on the
topic without getting attacked from 50
different directions especially these
days on Twitter so I've been hesitant to
do it because I want to target it for a
very specific kind of person there's a
bunch of people who
believe that working on your internal
state is useful there to focus on the
external and that's fine there's nothing
wrong with that they should do that and
that's who they how to get rich tweet
storm is for there's a bunch of people
who believe that the only thing worth
working on is complete liberation like
you become the Buddha and they'll attack
anything in the middle as being useless
that's fine too but most people aren't
there so what I want to do is to create
a tweet storm that is just very
practical advice for everyday people who
want to have a calmer internal state
just a set of understandings
realizations have truths and truths that
if you were to imbibe them properly and
again these are just pointers to ideas
that you already have and experiences
that you already have that if you keep
these top of mind slowly but steadily it
will help you with certain realizations
that will lead you to a kamar internal
state that's what I want to work on
Fitness is another big one I'm just not
the expert there there are plenty of
good people on Twitter who are better at
fitness than me and I think loving
household and relationships actually
automatically falls out of the other
things if you have a calm mind and if
you've already made money you should
have good relationship there's no reason
why you shouldn't a lot of divorces
actually happen over money unfortunately
that's just the reality of it so having
money removes that part of it a lot of
external battles happen because your
internal state is not good when you're
naturally internally peaceful you're
gonna pick less fights you're gonna be
more loving without expecting anything
in return and that will take care of
things on the external relationship
front so money solves your money
problems money buys you freedom in the
material world I think that was a tweet
from your cutting room floor and money
lets you not do the things that you
don't want to do yeah to me the ultimate
purpose of money is so that you do not
have to be in a specific place at a
specific time doing anything you don't
want to do
