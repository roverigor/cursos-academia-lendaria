we squander our time with the death of a
thousand cuts so another tweet ahead was
you should be too busy to do coffee
while still keeping an uncluttered
calendar people who know me know that
I'm famous for simultaneously doing two
things one is having a very clean
calendar I have almost no meetings on it
and there are people that I meet with
when they see my calendar they almost
weep well at the same time I am busy all
the time I'm always doing something and
it's usually quote unquote work-related
but it is whatever the highest impact
thing is that needs to be done at that
time and that I'm most interested
inspired about but the only way to do
that is to constantly ruthlessly decline
meetings people want to do coffee and
build relationships and that's fine
early in your career when you're still
exploring but later in your career were
exploiting and there are more things
coming at you and you have time for you
have to ruthlessly cut meetings out of
your life if someone wants to do a
meeting see if you can do it with a
phone call instead if they want to do a
phone call see if they can do it with an
email instead if they want to do it
email see if they can do it a text
message instead if their text messaging
you should probably be ignoring most
text messages unless they're true
emergencies so one has to be utterly
ruthless about dodging meetings when you
do do meetings do walking meetings do
standing meetings keep them short keep
them actionable keep them small any
meeting with eight people and it's
sitting in a conference table nothing is
getting done in that meeting you're
literally just dying one hour at a time
doing coffee reminds me of an old quote
I think from Steve Jobs when they asked
him hey why does an apple come to
conventions or why don't you come to my
convention and his response was well
then because we wouldn't be here working
yeah I used to have a tough time turning
people down for meetings but now I just
tell them outright I just said look I
don't do non-transactional meetings I
don't do meetings without a strict
agenda I don't do meetings unless we
absolutely have to maybe used to do this
he would email people when they would
ask maybe and I for a meeting like
coffee meeting get to know you
he would say we don't do meetings unless
is life and death urgent and then the
person has to physically respond yeah
it's life in that origin or there's no
meeting when you have something
important or something valuable other
busy interesting people will meet with
you your calling card has to be hey
here's what I'm done here's what I can
show you let's
and I'll be respectful of your time if
this is useful to you and I find that
there are very busy important people who
will take your meeting but you have to
come with a proper calling card
all the people who tweet and who email
famous or rich people saying hey if I
could just get one meeting with you and
they're vague about it they're not gonna
get anywhere in life you have to build
up the credibility when for example an
investor in the tech business and the
venture business looks at a startup the
first thing they want to see is they
want to see some evidence of product
progress they don't just want to even
see a slide back they want to see
product progress because the product
progress is the resume for the
entrepreneur it is the unshakable
unfaithful resume so you have to do the
work to use a crypto analogy you have to
have proof of work if you have proof of
work and you truly have something
interesting then you shouldn't hesitate
to put it together in an email and send
it to somebody but even then when you're
asking for a meeting you want to be
super actionable about it but I would
say even the other side even if you
yourself haven't made it yet if you
think you're gonna make it by going out
and networking and doing a whole bunch
of meetings you're probably incorrect
yes the networking can be important
early in your career and yes you can get
serendipitous with meetings but the odds
are pretty low and as we spend time
talking about earlier when you are just
meeting people and hoping to get that
lucky break you're relying on type 1
luck which is blind luck and type 2 luck
which is hustle luck but what you're not
getting is type 3 or type 4 luck which
are the better kinds where you spend
time developing a reputation working on
something developing a unique point of
view and being able to spot
opportunities that others can a busy
calendar and a busy mind will destroy
your ability to do great things in this
world if you want to be able to do great
things whether you're a musician or
whether you are a entrepreneur or
whether you're an investor you need free
time and you need a free mind
