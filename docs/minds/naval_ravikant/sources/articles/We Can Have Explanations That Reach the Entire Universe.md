david deutsch presents at the beginning
of the fabric of reality
this idea that you don't need to know
absolutely every single fact
that needs to be known in order to
understand fundamentally
everything that can be understood he was
presenting this vision there are
certain fundamental theories in science
and outside of science
and his four theories that he had were
quantum theory the theory of computation
a theory of epistemology
and evolution by natural selection that
these together
formed a world view a lens through which
you could
understand anything that could be
understood
i saw a beautiful video with him on
youtube where he was making the same
points
where he was saying you don't have to
memorize and know every fact you don't
have to know where every particle moved
but if you understand the deep
underlying theories behind everything
then you know
at a high level how everything works and
this can all be understood by
a single person a single brain a single
human being it's accessible to anybody
and that is a jaw-droppingly powerful
idea
we can have explanations that can reach
the entire universe
and it's worth going through the four
that you'd mentioned
quantum theory is one of them theory of
computation
is another one of them the theory of
evolution
is another one of them and then the
theory of knowledge or epistemology
is the fourth that's the way he
presented it in fabric of reality
is it interesting that relativity is not
in there he regards
quantum theory as being deeper than the
theory of relativity
at some point most physicists expect
that we're going to have a unification
of quantum theory and relativity that's
not to say that in that world view
that we're dismissing relativity but his
guess is that quantum theory will be
more foundational than what the theory
of relativity is
there'll be a space time of the
multiverse that's why
relativity doesn't appear amongst them
