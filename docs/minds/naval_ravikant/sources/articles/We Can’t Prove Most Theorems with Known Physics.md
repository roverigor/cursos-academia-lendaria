the overwhelming majority of theorems in
mathematics
are theorems that we cannot possibly
prove this is girdle's theorem
and it also comes out of turing's proof
of what is and is not computable
these things that are not computable
vastly outnumber the things that are
computable and what is computable
depends entirely upon
what computers we can make in this
physical universe the computers that we
can make
must obey our laws of physics if the
laws of physics were different
then we'd be able to prove different
sorts of mathematics
and this is another part of the
mathematician's misconception
they think they can get outside of the
laws of physics however their brain is
just a physical computer
their brain must obey the laws of
physics if they existed in a universe
with different laws of physics then they
could prove different theorems
but we exist in the universe that we're
in and so we're bound by a whole bunch
of things
not least of which is the finite speed
of light so there could be certain
things
out there in abstract space which we
would be able to
come to a more full understanding of if
we could get outside of the restrictions
of the laws of physics here happily none
of those theorems that
we cannot prove at the moment are
inherently interesting
some things can be inherently boring
namely all of these theorems which we
cannot possibly prove as true or false
those theorems can't have any bearing in
our physical universe
they have nothing to do with our
physical universe and this is why we say
they're
inherently uninteresting and there's a
lot of inherently uninteresting things
