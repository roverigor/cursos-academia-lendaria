let's talk briefly about the fermi
paradox since we're talking about aliens
for those listeners who don't know
enrico fermi was a famous physicist part
of the manhattan project and he said
where are the aliens the universe is so
large there's probably so many planets
that are capable of supporting life of
some kind or another shouldn't we have
seen them by now
around almost every star there is a
contingent of planets much like our own
solar system
and the number of stars that exists
within a typical galaxy like the milky
way is something like 200 billion
although the estimates go up to about
400 and the number of galaxies that we
can see is around 200 to 300 billion but
the observable universe is just a small
fraction of the entire universe that
means that the number of planets is
absolutely astonishing
astronomical surely given these numbers
it has to be the case that there are
not only planets out there that are
suitable for life but the universe
should be teeming with civilizations far
more advanced than ours less advanced in
ours and some that are similar in
advancement to ours so where are they
