you probably known evolved from his
Twitter account and we're gonna be
talking about his epic tweets storm on
how to get rich without getting lucky
we're going to go through most of the
tweets in detail giving the ball a
chance to expand on them and just
generally riff on the topic he'll
probably throw in some ideas that he
hasn't even published before you know
navall from his twitter account he's
also the co-founder of angel lists and
opinions he's a prolific tech investor
in companies like Twitter uber and many
more and I'm the co-founder evangelist
navall and I also co-authored the
venture hacks blog with him back in the
day yeah me how to get my street storm
definitely hit a nerve a lot of people
say it was helpful reach cross aisles
and people outside of tech industry
people in all walks of life people do
want to know how to solve their money
problems and everyone vaguely knows that
they want to be wealthy but they don't
have a good set of principles to do it
by what's the difference between wealth
money and status wealth is the thing
that you really want wealth is assets
that earn while you sleep wealth is the
factory that with the robots as cranking
out things wealth is the computer
program that's running at night that's
serving other customers wealth is even
money in the bank that is being
reinvested into other assets and into
other businesses even a house can be a
form of wealth because you can rent it
out although that's probably a lower use
of productivity but land and actually
doing some commercial enterprise so my
definition of wealth is much more
businesses and assets that can earn
while you sleep
but really the reason you want wealth is
because it biases your freedom so you
don't have to wear attire like a collar
around your neck so you don't have to
wake up at 7 a.m. and rush to work and
sit and commute traffic so you don't
have to waste away your entire life
grinding all the productive hours into a
way into a soulless job that doesn't
fulfill you so the purpose of wealth is
freedom it's nothing more than that it's
like to buy fur coats or drive Ferraris
or sail yachts or jet around the world
in your Gulfstream that stuff gets
really boring and really stupid really
fast it's really just so that you are
your own sovereign individual you're not
gonna get that unless you really want it
and the entire world wants it and the
entire world
working hard at it and to some extent it
is competitive it's a positive sum game
but there are competitive elements to it
because there's a finite amount of
resources right now in society and to
get the resources to do what you want
you have to stand out money is how we
transfer wealth money is social credits
it is the ability to have credits and
debits on other people's time if I do my
job right if I create value for society
Society says oh thank you we owe you
something in the future for the work
that you did in the past here's a little
IOU let's call that money and that money
gets the base because people steal the
IOU is the government prints extra IOU
used people renege on their IO used but
really what money is trying to be it is
trying to be a reliable Iowa you from
society that you are owed something for
something you or someone who gave you
that money did in the past and we can
transfer these IOUs around so really
money is how we transfer wealth there
are fundamentally two huge games in life
that people play one is the money game
because money's not gonna solve all your
problems but it's gonna solve all your
money problems so I think that people
know that they realize that they want to
make money but at the same time many of
them deep down believe that they can't
make it they don't want any wealth
creation to happen so they sort of
virtue signal by attacking the whole
enterprise by saying well I'm making
money is evil and you shouldn't do it
but I'll Bluff but what they're trying
to do is they're actually playing the
other game to the status game they're
trying to be high status in the eyes of
other people watching by saying well I
don't need money we don't want money and
then status is just your ranking in the
social hierarchy so wealth is not a
zero-sum game everybody in the world can
have a house because you have a house
doesn't take away from my ability to
have a house if anything the more houses
that are built the easier it becomes to
build houses the more we know about
building houses and just the more people
that can have houses so wealth is a very
positive sum game we create things
together we're starting this endeavor to
create this hopefully piece of art that
explains what we're doing at the end of
it something brand new will be create
it's a positive sub-game status on the
other hand is a zero-sum game it's a
very old game we've been playing it
since monkey tribes and it's
hierarchical who's number one who's
number two who's number three and for a
number three to move to number two
number two has to move out of that slot
so status is zero-sum game
politics is an example of a status game
even sports is an example of a status
game to be the winner there must be a
loser
I don't fundamentally love status games
they play an important role in our
society so we figure out who's in charge
but fundamentally you play them because
they're necessary evil the problem is an
evolutionary basis like if you go back
thousands of years status is a much
better predictor of survival than wealth
is you couldn't have wealth before the
farming age before farmers because you
couldn't store things hunter-gatherers
carried everything in their backs so
hunter-gatherers lived entirely in
status based societies farmers started
going to wealth based societies and the
modern industrial economies are much
more heavily wealth based societies but
there's always a subtle competition
going on between status and wealth for
example when journalists attacked rich
people or they attack the technology
industry they're really bidding for
status they're saying no the people are
more important and I the journalist
represents the people and therefore I am
more important the problem is that by
playing these status games to win at a
status game you have to put somebody
else down that's why you should avoid
status games in your life because they
make you into an angry combative person
you're always fighting to put other
people down to put yourself and the
people that you like up and they're
always gonna exist there's no way around
it but just realize that most of the
times when you're trying to create
wealth you're actually getting attacked
by someone else and they're trying to
look like a goody two-shoes but really
what they're doing is they're trying to
up their own status at your expense
they're just playing a different game
and it's a worse game it's a zero-sum
game instead of a positive Sun game
