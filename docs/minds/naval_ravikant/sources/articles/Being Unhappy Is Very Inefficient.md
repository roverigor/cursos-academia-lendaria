besides I'm too smart for it the other
objection is I don't want it to lower my
productivity I don't want to have less
desire or less work ethic fact-check and
that is true the more happy you are the
more content and peaceful you are that's
less likely you want to run out there
and change the world but at the same
time being unhappy is very inefficient
the peaceful person doesn't have
extraneous thoughts going through their
head if you are a driven unhappy person
your mind will be on 24/7 what are the
consequences of this your sleep is much
worse you're much more likely to react
to become angry and dig yourself into a
hole that you don't have to dig yourself
out of your decisions are going to be an
emotional impetuous you're much more
likely to be in the busy trap where
you're busy all the time running from
one thing to another because you can't
mentally prioritize you don't have peace
of mind so when it comes time to make
judgments you have too many threads
going through your head you'd have time
to devote to making those judgments so
there's a trade-off if you become the
Buddha tomorrow it's unlikely you'll
also launch rockets to the moon like
Elon Musk but on the other hand there
are enough successful optimistic leaders
scientists and innovators especially as
they get older that you see it's not
necessarily the case that happy people
have to be ineffective as I became much
happier in my life I actually became
much more effective I was able to form
relationships with people that earlier
in my life I would have kept at a
distance whatever preconceived notion I
can make decisions much more clearly now
because of see what the long-term
outcome is going to be and I cut
straight to the chase I don't try and
negotiate an extra 20 percent here or
there because I know that that's gonna
make me unhappy long-term is gonna make
the other person unhappy and it'll make
the deal less stable so I've actually
been more productive even though worked
less hard because I've made better
decisions
