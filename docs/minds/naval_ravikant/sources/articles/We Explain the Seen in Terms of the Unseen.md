now people might object at this point
and go how dare you invoke in science
things that cannot be seen things that
cannot be observed
this is completely antagonistic towards
the scientific method surely
and i'll say to anyone who's thinking
that right now almost
everything of interest that you know
about science
is about the unobserved let's consider
dinosaurs
dinosaurs are unobserved you say oh hold
on i've been to the museum i've seen a
dinosaur now you have seen a fossil
and a fossil isn't even a bone it's an
ossified bone it has been metamorphised
into rock
so no one has ever seen a dinosaur we
have seen things that look like
dinosaurs and interpreted them
to be huge reptilian bird-like creatures
that when we assemble their skeletons we
make up a story
about what this thing was that walked
the earth
tens or hundreds of millions of years
ago in the same way
no one has ever seen the core of the sun
and no one will ever observe
the core of the sun but we know about
stellar fusion we know
that hydrogen nuclei are being crushed
together there to form helium and in the
process producing heat
we don't see the big bang we don't see
the movement of continents almost
everything of interest in science
we do not observe even many of the
things that we say we have seen we've
actually just seen instruments detect
those things so we're watching the
effects
through instruments and then theorizing
that there are other universes out there
where the photons are interacting with
the photons that we can see
