labor and capital are much less
egalitarian not just in their inputs but
in their outputs let's say that I need
something that humans have to provide
like if I want a massage or if I need
like someone to cook my food the more of
a human element there is in providing
that service the less egalitarian it is
Jeff Bezos probably has much better
vacations and most of us right because
he has lots of humans running around
doing whatever he needs to do but if you
look at the output of code in media Jeff
Bezos doesn't get to watch better movies
and TV than we do Jeff Bezos doesn't get
to even have a better computing
experience like Google doesn't give him
some premium special Google account
where his searches are better it's the
nature of code and media output that the
same product is accessible to everybody
and it turns into a positive sum game
where if Jeff Bezos is consuming the
same product as a thousand other people
that products to be better than the
version that Jeff would consume on his
own whereas with other products that's
not true if you look at something like
buying a Rolex which is no longer about
telling time it's a signaling good it's
all about showing off I have a Rolex
that's a zero-sum game if everybody in
the world is wearing a Rolex then people
don't want to wear Rolex is anymore
because they're no longer signal it's
canceled out the effect and so rich
people do have an advantage in consuming
that product they'll just price it up
till only they can have Rolexes and then
poor people can have relaxes and relaxes
resume they're signalling value but
something like watching Netflix or using
Google or using Facebook or YouTube or
even frankly modern-day cars like rich
people don't have better cars they just
have weirder cars you can't drive a
Lamborghini on the street at any speed
that makes sense for a Lamborghini so
it's actually a worst car in the street
it just turned into a signaling good at
that point your sweet spot where you
want to be is somewhere like a Tesla
Model 3 or like a Toyota Corolla it's an
amazing car a new Toyota Corolla is a
really nice car but because it's
mainstream the technology has amortized
the cost of production over the largest
number of consumers possible and the
best products tend to be at the center
at the sweet spot the middle-class
rather than being targeted at the upper
class so I think one of the things that
we don't necessary forms of leverage
have gone from being human based labor
based and being capital
is too big more product and code and
media base that most of the goods and
services that we consume are becoming
much more egalitarian in their
consumption even food is becoming that
way like food is becoming cheap and
abundant at least in the first world too
much so to our detriment Jeff Bezos
isn't initially eating better of food
he's just eating different food or he's
eating like food that's prepared and
served fee at Wrigley so it's almost
like more again that human element
performance but the labor element out of
food production has gone down massively
the capital element has gone down
massively and so even food production
itself has become more technology
oriented and so the gap between the
haves and the have-nots is getting
smaller so if you care about ethics in
wealth creation it is better to create
your wealth using code and media as
leverage because then those products are
sort of equally available to everybody
as opposed to trying to create your
wealth through labor or capital because
what I'm referring to here is scale
economies technology products and media
products have such amazing scale
economies that you always want to use
the product that is used by the most
people the one that's used by the most
people ends up having the largest budget
there's no marginal cost of adding
another user and so with the largest
budget you get the highest quality so
the best TV shows are actually not gonna
be some obscure ones just made for a few
rich people they're gonna be the
big-budget ones like the game of thrones
with the Breaking Bad or bird box where
they have massive massive budgets they
can just use those budgets to get to a
certain quality level and then the rich
people to be different they have to fly
to Sundance and watch a documentary
because you and I aren't gonna fly to
Sundance because you know that's
something that bored rich people do to
show off and we're not gonna watch a
documentary because Muslims aren't
actually even that good all right again
if you're wealthy today for large
classes of things you spend your money
on signaling goods to show other people
that you're wealthy and you try and
convert them to status as opposed to
actually consuming the goods for their
own sake people and capital as a form of
leverage have a negative externality and
code and product have a positive
externality attached to them if I was
going to sum up your point I think that
capital and labor are also starting to
become a little more
permissionless or at least the
permissioning is diffuse because of the
internet so instead of labour we have
community now which is diffused form of
labour for example Mark Zuckerberg has a
billion people doing work for him by
using Facebook and instead of going to
raise capital from someone who's rich
now we have crowdfunding so you can
raise millions and billions of dollars
for a charity for a health problem or
for a business you can do it all online
so capital and labor are also becoming
permissionless and you don't need to
necessarily do it the old-fashioned way
where you have to go around and ask
people for permission to use their money
or their time
