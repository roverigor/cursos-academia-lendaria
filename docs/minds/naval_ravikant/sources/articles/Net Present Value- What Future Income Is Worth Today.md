let's talk about NPV NPV is just the net
present value of something it's when you
say that stream of payments I'm gonna
get in the future what is that worth
today so a common example of this is
you're joining a startup company and
you're getting stock options and the
founder says well this company is going
to be worth a billion dollars and I'm
giving you Oh point one percent of the
company therefore you're getting a
million dollars worth of stock what he's
or she's arguing is what's gonna be
worth in the future you have to discount
that back to today you have to figure
out what is that worth today and you
have to apply a discount rate or an
interest rate that takes into account
the massive risk the startups face what
you end up with is the price that it's
worth today and that's the price at
which a venture capitalist would invest
in the company today so if that founder
just raised around at ten million
dollars and that company's only worth
one percent of what the founders arguing
your million-dollar package is actually
worth ten thousand dollars
so NPV calculations at a very rough
level you should be very comfortable
doing in your head
