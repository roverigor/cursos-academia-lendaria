you want to talk a little bit about the
skills that you need in particular
specific knowledge accountability
leverage and judgment
so the first tweet in this area is arm
yourself with specific knowledge
accountability and leverage and I'll
throw in judgment as well I don't think
you covered that in that particular
tweet if you want to make money you have
to get paid at scale and why you
that's accountability at scale that's
leverage and just you getting paid as
opposed to somebody else getting paid
that's specific knowledge so specific
knowledge is probably the hardest thing
to get across in this whole tweet storm
and it's probably the thing that people
get the most confused about the thing is
that we have this idea that everything
can be taught everything can be taught
in school and it's not true that
everything can be taught in fact the
most interesting things cannot be taught
but everything can be learned and very
often that learning either comes from
some innate characteristics in your DNA
or it could be through your childhood
where you learn soft skills which are
very very hard to teach later on in life
or it's something that is brand-new so
nobody else knows how to do it either or
it's true on-the-job training because
your pattern matching into highly
complex environments basically building
judgment in a specific domain classic
example is investing but it could be in
anything it could be in judgment in
running a fleet of trucks it could be a
judgment in weather forecasting so
specific knowledge is the knowledge that
you care about especially if you're
later in life let's say your post 20 21
22 you almost don't get to choose which
specific knowledge you have rather you
get to look at what you have already
built by that point in time and then you
can build on top of it the first thing
to notice about specific knowledge is
that you can't be trained for it if you
can be trained for it if you can go to a
class and learn specific knowledge then
somebody else can be trained for it -
and then we can mass produce and mass
train people heck we've even program
computers to do it and eventually we can
program robots to walk around doing it
so if that's the case then you're
extremely replaceable and all we have to
pay you is the minimum wage that we have
to pay it
get you to do it when there are lots of
other takers who can be trained to do it
so really your returns just devolve into
your cost of training plus a return on
investment on that training so you
really want to pick up specific
knowledge you need your schooling you
need your training to be able to
capitalize on the best specific
knowledge but the part of it that you
get paid for is the specific knowledge
for example someone who goes and gets a
degree in psychology and then becomes a
salesperson well if they were already a
formidable salesperson who had great
salesmanship to begin with then the
psychology degree is leverage it arms
them and they do much better at sales
but if they were always an introvert
never very good at sales and they're
trying to use psychology to learn sales
they're just not gonna get that great at
it
so Civic knowledge is found much more by
pursuing your innate talents your
genuine curiosity and your passion it's
not by going to school for whatever it
is the hottest job it's not for going
into whatever field investors say is the
hottest you very often specific
knowledge is at the edge of knowledge
it's also stuff that's just being
figured out or is really hard to figure
out so if you're not a hundred percent
into it somebody else who is a hundred
percent into it will outperform you and
they won't just outperform you by a
little bit they'll outperform you by a
lot because now we're operating the
domain of ideas
compound interest really applies and
leverage really applies so if you're
operating with a thousand times leverage
and somebody is right eighty percent of
the time and somebody is else right
ninety percent of time the person who's
right ninety percent of the time will
literally get paid hundreds of times
more by the market because of the
leverage and because of the compounding
factors in being correct so you really
want to make sure you're good at it so
they're genuine curiosity is very
important so very often it's not
something you sit down and you reason
about it's more found by observation you
almost have to look back on your own
life and see what you're actually good
at for example I wanted to be a
scientist and that is where a lot of my
moral hierarchy comes from my view
scientist sort of at the top of the
production chain for Humanity and the
group of scientists who have made real
breakthroughs and contributions have
probably added more to human society and
I think than any single other class of
human beings not to take away anything
from art or politics or engineer
or business but without the science you
know we'd still be scrabbling the dirt
fighting with sticks and trying to start
fires my whole value system was built
around scientists and I wanted to be a
great scientist but when I actually look
back at what I was uniquely good at and
what I ended up spending my time doing
there was more around making money
tinkering with technology and selling
people on things explaining things
talking to people so I have some sales
skills which is a form of specific
knowledge that I have I have some
analytical skills around how to make
money and I having this ability to
absorb data obsess about it and break it
down and that is a specific skill that I
have I also just love tinkering with
technology and all of this stuff feels
like play to me but it looks like work
to others so there are other people to
whom these things would be hard they say
like well how do I get good at being
pithy and selling ideas well if you're
not already good at it or you're not
really into it maybe it's not your thing
focus on the thing that you are really
into this is ironic but the first person
to actually point out my real specific
knowledge was my mother and she did it
as an aside talking from the kitchen and
she said it when I was like 15 or 16
years old I was telling a friend of mine
that I wanted to be an astrophysicist
and she said no you're gonna go into
business and I was like what my mom's
telling me I'm gonna be in business I'm
gonna be an astrophysicist mom doesn't
know she's talking about but mom knew
exactly what she was talking about she
had already observed that every time we
walked down the street I would critique
the local pizza parlor on why they were
selling their slices a certain way with
certain toppings and why the process of
ordering was this way when it should
have been that way so she knew that I
was just had more of a business curious
mind but then my obsession with science
combined to create technology and
technology businesses where I found
myself so very often your specific
knowledge is observed and often observed
by other people who know you well and
reveal in situations rather than
something that you come up with
