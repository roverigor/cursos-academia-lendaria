in almost all cases you only ever have
one theory on offer in the case of
gravity there literally is only one
theory on offer at the moment there's
general relativity previously we did
have two theories we had newtonian
gravity and we had general relativity
but we did a crucial experiment this
idea of crucial experiment is the
cherry on top of science you've got
these two competing theories and you
have a particular experiment that if it
goes one way one theory is ruled out but
the other theory is not in which case
you
keep that theory for so long as no
problems arising this vision of
knowledge enables us to have an open
ended quest for progress which is
completely unlike any other idea about
knowledge the overwhelming majority of
physicists are still bayesian the reason
they're still bayesian is because this
is typically what's taught in
universities and this is what passes for
an intellectually rigorous way of
understanding the world but all it is is
what i would call a species of scientism
it's because they have a formula behind
them bayes theorem which is a perfectly
acceptable statistical formula people
use it all the time in perfectly
legitimate ways it's just that it's not
an epistemology it's not a way of
guaranteeing
or even being confident that your theory
is actually true my favorite example of
this is
prior to 1919 approximately
every single experiment that was done on
newton's theory of gravity showed that
it was consistent with newton's theory
of gravity what does a bayesian say in
that situation what a bayesian has to
say is getting more and more confident
in newton's theory how does that make
sense how do you square that circle of
the day before it was shown to be false
was the day when you were most confident
in it now papyrian doesn't have this
problem peperion just says at no point
was newton's theory actually true it
contains some truth but that truth isn't
a
thing that we can measure i say it
contains some truth because
it's certainly got more direct
connection to reality than some other
random person's guess about what the
nature of gravity is gravity does indeed
approximately vary as the inverse square
law
but not exactly and so we need general
relativity to correct the errors in
newton's theory of gravity even though
general relativity is our best theory
right now but can't ultimately be the
final theory of gravity there can be no
final theory of gravity all we have is
better and better approximations to
reality i think the reason we fall into
beijing so easily is probably related to
why we found the pessimism so easily
we're evolutionarily hardwired for
basianism every other animal on the
planet that can't form good explanations
is a basin
they're just looking at repeated events
and saying the sun rose yesterday the
sun will rise tomorrow if i touch that
thing it's hot it's probably going to be
hot in the future so that is how most of
our biological systems and how most of
our evolutionary heritage worked it's
just now we have this neocortex that can
form good explanations that can explain
the scene in terms of the unseen and
that gives us a higher level of
reasoning but that higher level of
reasoning is not instinctual to us it
requires effort it requires deep
thinking but we default to bayesianism
because that is how a lot of the natural
world around us seems to work at least
at the purely biological level
