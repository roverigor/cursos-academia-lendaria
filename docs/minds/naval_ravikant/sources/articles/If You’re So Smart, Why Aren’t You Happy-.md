a common complaint where I'm from where
I'm surrounded by lots of smart
overachievers is that happiness is for
stupid people or happiness is for lazy
people a lot of times it's not runners
will say I don't want to be happy
because I want to be successful if I'm
too happy perhaps I would lose my desire
and I will no longer work hard and I
will no longer be successful and like
everything else there is some truth to
this generally the more intelligent you
are the more you can see behind the
facade of everyday life being easy or
safe you can see all the risks and the
downsides of the calamities that await
us you can see the cynicism and the
manipulation behind so many things that
are portrayed as being good for you or
good for society you naturally become
cynical and you signal your intelligence
through cynicism very smart people will
often communicate in purely cynical
observations it's okay to not want to be
happy but we're gonna explore together
whether you can increase your happiness
level without significantly lowering
your drive and without significantly
lowering your intellect so let's take
the first one which is I'm not happy
because I'm smart partially true you are
unhappy partially because you know too
much you've been exposed to too much you
understand too much but that doesn't
mean that you can't undo it and retain
your intelligence you're not smart
because you're unhappy so don't get it
backwards but yes you're unhappy because
you're smart it means that it's gonna
take more work for you to be happy but
the good news is smart people are good
at figuring out the truth and it turns
out the more you dig into certain deep
truths then naturally freer and more
peaceful you will become and that peace
will itself lead to happiness if you're
so smart why aren't you happy I
absolutely believe that it's true the
beauty in being mentally high
functioning in our society is that you
can trade it for almost anything if
you're smart you can figure out how to
be healthy within your genetic
constraints if you're smart you can
figure out how to be wealthy within your
local environmental constraints if
you're smart you can figure out how to
be happy within your biological
constraints but your biological
constraints are a lot larger than you
might think for people who have ever
drunk but on psychedelics meditated
deeply experience altered states of mind
through breathing and hypnotic
techniques they turn into versions of
themselves that are much happier for
brief periods of time now some of this
is a fake pleasure driven happiness of
course but there's some truth to it as
well or you wouldn't desire that state
so in a sense it can show you the
dynamic range that you have as a human
the ability that you have to go into
certain states where you're happier is
actually quite large so how do you nudge
yourself in that direction on a
perpetual basis as opposed to just
visiting there by essentially stunning
your mind into submission and silence
