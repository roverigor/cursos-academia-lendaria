all right welcome everybody back to the
podcast we have with us haseeb Qureshi
who's our partner at dragonfly haseeb
and I used to work together back when I
was more active in crypto land and
vitalik is of course a polymath
ingenious although he may bristle at
that description who created ethereum
which is the first smart contract
blockchain to gain any volume and change
the face of blockchain computing as we
know it let's see if you want to give us
a quick one paragraph background
yourself
so I'm a software engineer by background
I'm now an investor I run dragonfly
Capital which is a global crypto fund we
only invest into crypto and I've been
doing this for a little bit over four
years now it's funny because when I
first got into crypto I remember I was
actually at ic3 this academic crypto
conference I just left my job at Airbnb
as a software engineer and I met vitalik
for the first time and I asked you what
do you think is the most important
problem to solve in crypto at the time
your answer was something about wallets
so you were like I think it's important
to build more wallets and at that time I
had a vague understanding of what that
meant to build wallets but that was what
triggered my dive down the rabbit hole
of ethereum and I remember in the very
early days when I was first really
diving deep into crypto I remember
coming away with a very strong feeling
after that ic3 conference that Bitcoin
was going to die and the reason why I
thought Bitcoin was going to die is I
was like look at the obvious massive
Delta in the intellectual energy and
character of what's going on in the
ethereum world which just everything
that I saw at ic3 versus what I saw in
the Bitcoin World which was a whole lot
of religious anger and fervor and not a
whole lot of innovation and I turned out
to have a very simplistic understanding
of that time but that was how I first
got into crypto full-time through that
small interaction that you and I had
back then and you also have a background
as a poker player if I remember
correctly that is also correct it's a
former life before I got into the
technology world that used to be a
professional poker player for about five
years there's a strangely large number
of us who were either in Magic the
Gathering or in poker before we got into
crypto or World of Warcraft maybe it's
just Geeks and Gamers everything is
bigger than that I had this theory that
you and I have talked about before every
generation there is some hustle that if
you're really smart very aggressive and
looking for edges and not afraid of
looking weird there are ways to get
ahead early or to make a lot of money in
a way that's not obvious to most people
and it's maybe even slightly subversive
it's the kind of thing your parents
would raise their eyebrows if you were
spending a lot of time on in my day that
was poker there's a time when it became
fantasy sports and it came crypto that
it became D5 and liquidity mining then
it became nft trading two years from now
there will be something else when nfts
are very professionalized and there's
not that much Alpha to be made trading
nfts there'll be something else that
young really hungry people who are not
afraid of looking dumb are going to be
doing to make a lot of money vitalik you
want to give us a quick background
born in Russia moves to Canada when he
was six at the time I had already been
doing a lot of math a lot of programming
and I had been halfway through high
school and I Came Upon This interesting
Bitcoin thing it fascinated me
immediately because of how it combines
together all of my interests at the time
Bitcoin has the mathematical aspects and
has the cryptography it has the computer
science the code it's all open source
software I had been very into open
source software at the time and then
also there's these economic and
political aspects I had been following
Austrian economics a little already and
then Bitcoin just hit all of those
buttons I started trying my best to join
the Bitcoin Community they started
scouring through the Bitcoin forums
looking for jobs that would pay me in
Bitcoin because I figured the point of
Bitcoin is they were supposed to earn it
I found someone willing to pay me five
Bitcoins which back then was four
dollars per article to write articles
for his blog I did this for a few months
then eventually a poker player if I
remain any AD names I'm behalicia
reached out to me and said the key was
starting a Bitcoin magazine and wanted
me to be the first writer I immediately
agreed and I became the first writer for
Bitcoin magazine I kept doing that for
about two weeks started doing more and
more Bitcoin related writing learning
about Bitcoin eventually more
programming related projects did some
work for a covered coins Library called
Bitcoin X and started getting deeper and
deeper into the space then in mid-2013 I
decided that I would go on this Bitcoin
trip take half a year off of University
and go around the world visit all of the
Bitcoin communities I could understand
the community and see what everyone is
up to eventually after a few months of
this I came upon these people that were
trying to take the blockchain and extend
it to do things other than
cryptocurrency so if there was this
project called covered coins that
existed for a long time which was trying
to use the blockchain as this database
layer to issue other kinds of assets on
top so you could issue shares on the
blockchain you could issue digital
dollars on the blockchain now there is a
project called mastercoin that was
trying to extend that even further to
create a full Financial system do what
we call D5 today but this very early
version of that and after I spent enough
time in these circles I eventually had
my own idea for how to create a more
general purpose version of all of these
ideas instead of a blockchain for one
application a blockchain that you can
build any application on top of and
that's where ethereum came from so
ethereum is a blockchain on which you
can build any application and Bitcoin is
obviously limited to trying to be new
money or a new Reserve currency or
nowadays some people say digital gold so
you were the original Creator along with
a team who coded it up and You released
it how old were you when you did that 19
and how long had you been on computers
at that point when did you first start
programming I think I started
programming when I was around 10 or so
and were you mostly self-taught or did
you go to school for this what's the
secret here besides the obvious genetics
I just grew up programming video games
for myself to play so I would make a
video game played until I got tired then
make another video game and then play it
until I got hired and that's pretty much
how I learned all the way up until high
school did your parents do anything or
did the environment do anything uniquely
to Foster your development and
programming my parents did buy me a lot
of programming books they did find some
programming classes for me and some math
classes as well so they were definitely
very supportive and were you in the
gifted program or just the Normal public
school system or private school I was in
the gifted program or the public school
up until grade 8 and then for high
school my parents moved you over to a
private school and I found the private
school to be a much better experience
were most of your collaboration
colleagues met online or was there a
physical place that you were at where
they were all hanging out and you
stumbled into them pretty much entirely
online the Bitcoin world lived on a
forum unless you were in one of the
major cities like New York or San
Francisco or that had a community which
started almost from the beginning so
Bitcoin magazine was a fully remote
company from day one Bitcoin weekly the
blog before Bitcoin magazine also fully
remote from day one and to this day most
of your collaborators you're pretty much
spread out all over the world isn't that
correct pretty much yeah so ethereum
came out to the world in 2014 I think if
I remember correctly you'd been
developing it for a few years before
that there was a public sale a lot of
people got involved and then 2017 there
was a boom around people building assets
on top of ethereum different kinds of
coins and then of course gaming and nfts
and D5 and all of those things came
along let's just go through the
evolution of ethereum what does ethereum
do at a core level what does it do well
and today what does it do poorly what
does it need to get better at
I think of ethereum as a general purpose
blockchain so instead of being a
blockchain for one application it's a
data blockchain that you can build any
application on top of and the way that
you do this on ethereum is you write a
piece of code and you create a digital
transaction that contains that piece of
code and publish it and what you publish
this transaction and that transaction
gets included into a block on the
blockchain this creates an object called
a contract and this is a virtual object
that the blockchain keeps track of a
contract is an object that contains a
piece of code now the blockchain has a
subject that has a piece of code and
that is a little application that the
ethereum blockchain maintains from that
point forward so then anyone after that
point can send another transaction that
says I wants to talk to this object so
step one I created a transaction that
creates this object we'll call that
object X then step two you want to use
my application so you send a transaction
and in your transaction you say I want
to talk to Smart contract apps and
here's a little piece of data that says
here's what I want to do with that
application when that transaction gets
included in a block the piece of code
that I first published runs taking as
input the data from your transaction and
interprets it in whatever way it wants
so we can make this more concrete with
an example right so let's say if I have
a company and I want to issue shares on
the blockchain I am going to create a
transaction that contains a program and
the rules of that program are going to
say well what can you do with shares
we'll just say you can transfer your
shares to someone else and you can vote
right so the program is going to
interpret any data that it sees either
as an introduction to transfer your
shares to someone else or as an
instruction to make a vote I publish
this transaction that initializes the
whole thing and as part of that
transaction I might say the file has 50
shares haseeb has 100 shares and I have
25 shares so now there is this thing on
the blockchain and it has a piece of
code and it has its own little memory
that says I have 25 I see it has 100 and
Naval has 50. so then Naval is feeling
generous and wants to give half his
shares to me so Naval is going to create
a transaction and that transaction is
going to have some data it's going to
encode this idea that I Naval wants to
sense 25 of my shares to metallic so you
create a transaction that encodes this
sends it to the network it gets included
into a block and then once it gets
included the piece of code runs in the
piece of code sees the transaction and
it sees okay clearly I have to transfer
25 shares from novault if italic before
Naval had 50 I'm going to subtract 25
now in the fall has 25 before vitalika
25 now vitalacas 50. so I'm going to
write down the vitalacas 50 now and
that's it the transaction got processed
why do all this in the cloud in this
very convoluted way this very
complicated blockchain when I just use a
normal computer when I just send an
email this creates this very transparent
public record of what the rules are R
and this guarantee that all of the
interactions with this application that
I created followed the rules there is no
actor that has a back door key it's a
trusted computer in the cloud that each
of us can verify all of the activity we
can audit all of it and we know that
nobody cheated nobody else moved my
funds I was the one who moved the funds
and everyone can authenticate the code
was exactly the code that was supposed
to be run and there are obviously
sacrifices for this right this is not
free exactly even I as the creator of
the contract in this example I do not
have the ability to later go in and say
oh I changed my mind I'm going to give
myself 400 shares once I created it once
I publish it I have no more privileges
than anyone else the application doesn't
even have an owner so that's powerful
right completely huge role completely
transparent visible treats everyone
equally according to what the rules are
now what do you sacrifice for this one
big thing that you sacrifice is
efficiency the way that all of these
blockchains including Bitcoin and
ethereum work is to that you have this
network of tens of thousands of
computers Each of which helped to verify
the transaction so when I broadcast this
transaction that transaction goes out to
every single computer on the network and
every single computer on the network
runs that piece of code every single
executor on the network verifies and
every single keep it on the network
processes it parallel Computing was I
take my code and I split it across a
thousand computers and each one runs one
thousand now I send it to a thousand
computers and all thousand computers run
my code exactly yeah it's a very
different kind of computing the way to
intuitively think about why it makes
sense is compare text to audio and video
so right now we're recording a podcast
and the podcast has some audio podcast
has some video and to see each other on
video there's hundreds of thousands of
bytes that are flowing around between us
every second but technically those
hundreds of thousands of likes they're
not necessary if you wanted to we could
just do the whole thing over a text
conversation but there are some benefits
from us being able to hear each other's
voices to see each other's Expressions
so there's already lots of very high
overhead computation that people do with
their computers video is a great example
audio is a great example the things that
happen in the blockchain are more
similar to text like Nepal -25 italic
plus 25. it's this extremely simple
extremely efficient stuff so it is
perfectly viable to have many thousands
of users and even millions of users
activity all get verified by one single
computer because the blockchain doesn't
do everything the blockchain just does
this Core Business logic and that the
Core Business logic is not actually well
that complex this is because of the
constraints of blockchains it's a
function of the constraints of all the
redundancy you have to have when you're
on blockchains that we can only afford
to put the naval minus 25 italic plus 25
on the blockchain the goal in the long
run is that we want to make it so more
and more kinds of low value computations
can also be happening on the blockchain
but right now out of necessity only high
value transactions can afford to pay the
cost so to back up for a second what
you've done is you've built a computer
in the cloud a virtual computer that's
stitched out of thousands or tens of
thousands of real computers and that
computer is very inefficient it's very
slow it's going to move at a very slow
speed so comparing it and throughput to
your home computer or to a super
computer's nonsense is besides the point
but any piece of code running on this is
very trustworthy and you know it hasn't
been hacked and now you no longer need a
government or you no longer need a
single actor in the middle like a Mark
Zuckerberg running Facebook to tell you
which transactions are valid which
contracts are valid which programs are
valid which ones aren't you've done away
with the need for trusted third parties
and you've replaced it with a trusted
computer that is being audited verified
and checked by thousands or tens of
thousands of computers the technological
complexity comes in scaling this making
this computer faster keeping it secure
creating incentives both economic and
technological and gaming theoretic to
prevent and people from hacking it and
breaking it and having an incentive
mechanism in there so that people want
to add computers to this network and
also having a disincentive mechanism to
use the network you have to pay for it
otherwise you can easily overwhelm it
this giant Contraption is ethereum
people have of course come along and
created other smart contract blockchains
but even though we call it a smart
contract blockchain it's really a
trusted computer in the cloud that can
in theory run any application but it
trades off performance in exchange for
security and that security can be
measured through decentralization in
other words no single entity can control
the computer it can be measured in terms
of how secure the code can it be hacked
or not
etc etc and there's a lot of subtle and
beautiful elements that come out of it
that are non-obvious because we're used
to thinking of computers as okay
Facebook runs some computers these are
Central Computers run by Mark Zuckerberg
and crew and the code is not open of
course I'm not entitled to see the code
I'm just a user I don don't own my data
they own the data it's sitting in that
database and I don't have access to the
database to read or write from it I have
to go to Facebook and ask them to read
or write from the database but now
you've created a computer where the code
is all open in fact even the data is
open but some of it's encrypted some of
it's not some data anyone has access to
see some data you actually need to have
your encryption decryption key to get
access to and anyone can read or write
from it if they have the proper
permissions this is a mind-blowingly
crazy concept it is a truly shared
database with no owner and permissions
at a very granular user level where the
users actually own the data and in fact
the users own the network that's now run
by this database so if someone built the
next Facebook application on top of
ethereum they could engineer in such a
way the users actually own that
application this is the remarkable
achievement underlying ethereum and it's
hard to encapsulate in a few words but
one way that I tried to do it was I said
smart contracts are castles made of math
freely trading with each other tassels
these are impregnable encryption is very
strong and creates a strong defense but
they're made out of mathematics very
much like the video games that you are
programming in your youth these are
constructs put together by anyone
anonymously or pseudonymously around the
world and they're engaging in free trade
with each other we're the owner of each
Castle is deciding what trade happens
with somebody else now there are
obviously substantial limitations to
this so let's talk about the limitations
we've already talked about how this
computer network is going to move at the
speed of roughly one computer at least
until we get into some of the ways to
scale it and to grow it but what are
other limitations of this network can
you give us some concrete applications
of what's good for and where you
wouldn't use it so aside from scaling
the other big performance so limit on it
is the latency so when I send a
transaction I have to wait maybe about
half a minute for the transaction to get
included and to get a confirmation back
now in the future this is going to get
somewhat more efficient maybe like 10 or
12 seconds is going to be realistic soon
but this isn't a real-time thing that
you would stick real-time video game
logic onto for example you could use it
for payments but you probably don't want
to use it for things that are more
real-time than payments need to be
that's one limitation another limitation
is the transparency properties this
probably is one of those places where we
might have to get into some of the
cryptography weeds but basically the
blockchain by itself is fully
transparent right everyone can see
everything that's going on if we go back
to the example and we issue the shares
of this company on the blockchain then
when Naval sends me his 25 shares
everyone in the world is going to be
able to see that now there might be some
cases where that's total really fine but
there might be some cases where you'll
want some privacy and this is one of
those areas where you often can get
privacy and security at the same time
there's this extra cryptographic math
you don't need to get into it in depth
but it's worth saying the name it's zero
knowledge proofs the way that I describe
zero knowledge proofs are that it's a
way of proving something about a piece
of information without revealing that
piece of information let's say we're
going to have the same application the
shares of my company on the blockchain
except instead of the blockchain
recording the numbers 25 50 and 100 the
blockchain is going to record an
encrypted version of 25 an encrypted
version of 50 and an encrypted version
of 100 and then when Naval sends me his
25 shares he's gonna say here is the
encryption of the number of shares I
have right now here is the encryption of
the new number of shares I'm going to
have here is the encryption of the
number of shares I'm giving this Outlook
and then here is this magic
cryptographic proof that says that the
numbers line up it says X Plus y equals
z and I'm not trying to give away more
than I actually have you could verify
that everything's following the rules
without verifying which specific thing a
particular transaction is doing and with
what parameters so there are ways to get
back your security and privacy at the
same time there are still some limits to
how much privacy you can get for example
even in this case people can see when
people are interacting with this
particular application at all if you
just use a blockchain as you lose a lot
of privacy if you use a blockchain plus
zero knowledge proofs and plus other
kinds of cryptography you can often get
back a lot of privacy and you can
potentially get even more privacy than
in the centralized case because in a
traditional centralized system there is
the Facebook that runs everything and
then sees everything but with these
kinds of systems there is no one at the
sensor all the reasons has this
mathematical Castle in this guy
verifying the proofs So in theory we
could get digital cash which is
anonymous one step further we could even
get Anonymous smart contracts where
maybe you can tell you and I interacted
with a smart contract with the details
beyond that are lost not even in theory
this is something that's existed this
ecash has been around for more than five
years now zcash is a blockchain that is
built around zero knowledge proofs for
all the transactions the recipients and
the senders can be anonymous truly Moon
math as they say so let's fast forward a
bit 10 years from now 20 years from now
I know that's really long out in
blockchain land because Bitcoin only
came around in 2009 and eth only came
around the early teens but let's say 10
or 20 years from now we've done all the
hard engineering that we need we've
built as much technology as we can
imagine what are the limits of
blockchain scalability and privacy where
do we end up do we end up with every
transaction we want to have private is
private or do you think a lot of them
stay public do you think that we're
using blockchains for almost all cloud
computing or is still limited into the
financial and high value domain one of
the things of its importance to mention
is that the scalability of blockchains
is improving and it's going to improve
pretty rapidly the way the blockchains
work today is I send a transaction the
transaction gets on the network and
every single computer on the network has
to verify that transaction there are
scaling techniques once again we don't
have to get into the weeds but things
like Roll-Ups charting these are
technologies that allow you to use
blockchains in a more clever way where
you still have a lot of very redundant
computation happening but it's much more
efficient so what are the different
techniques let's just go through those
so centralized system steady transaction
you send it to Facebook Facebook has one
computer one computer verifies it a
blockchain you have 100 000 computers
you send your transaction all hundred
thousand computers verified sharding set
your transaction the system randomly
chooses 1 000 computers out of a hundred
thousand computers those 1000 computers
verified and the transaction gets
accepted so instead of all hundred
thousand computers we are fine only one
thousand computers verifying when you
have lots of transactions being accepted
into the system every single computer in
the network on average is only going to
have to verify like maybe one percent of
all the activity you can actually crank
up the efficiency even higher eventually
you could say every computer doesn't
even have to verify one percent every
key filter maybe only has to verify 0.1
percent think of how bits or it works
right bittorridge is also like a highly
distributed network if you want to
download the really popular movies you
generally can but on BitTorrent you
don't literally have every computer
download every movie because that's
totally crazy on average the movies
we're going to have a few hundred
theaters maybe a few thousand theaters
so that number is big enough that you
have the redundancy and you can
generally get the content that you want
but it's not so redundant that it just
becomes crazy inefficient the question
is can you create a network that works
the way that BitTorrent works from the
point of view of data distribution and
efficiency but create something that
still has the same verification
properties that blockchains do that is
what shorting does one of the weaknesses
of sharding is that it is more
technically complicated you have to
actually do the work to figure out what
exactly are the rules by which these
transactions get split apart between the
nodes how do you make them all talk to
each other how do you do this
distributed verification the approach
that is simpler from a protocol
perspective is to just say we're going
to require every node in this network to
be really powerful so instead of a
laptop being able to be a node would
require every node to be almost a super
computer if you do that then you can
make blockchains that still work the way
that they work today but they could
process more transactions maybe instead
of being able to process 50 a second
they might be able to process a thousand
a second or five thousand a second the
weakness of this approach and the reason
why ethereum is not taking this approach
is that it leads to more centralization
right the number of people who can
actually verify what's going on
decreases the number of people who need
to collude to try to push through some
change to the protocol that the users
might not want becomes much smaller it's
still much more decentralized than
Facebook but it becomes much less
decentralized than it could be and maybe
in some cases that's the right approach
if you want to make like a decentralized
video game you want it to be
decentralized but it's not the sort of
thing where if it gets captured people
lose hundreds of millions of dollars
then maybe this more centralized
approach is actually totally fine there
is this whole spectrum of applications
in the Middle where it's fine but if you
want something that's high Assurance
then you do wants to break the
decentralization up closer to the
maximum and the current ethereum does
provide that it does provide this very
high level of decentralization and high
level of verifiability but at the
expense of scaling so what we're trying
to do with charting is we're trying to
say can you provide this high level of
decentralization and high level of
verifiability and still have a higher
level of scaling at the same time
I want to probe a little bit further on
this decentralization question a lot of
folks who are coming into crypto
especially if they don't have a lot of
experience they notice that
decentralization is important it's hard
to end up in crypto without believing
that decentralization matters to some
degree but the question is why here you
show up and there's a cultural slider
about how much decentralization is the
right amount and ethereum is like you
have to be able to verify ethereum on a
laptop and the question is why a laptop
the larger the number of users that are
verifying by default the more secure a
blockchain is because in the extreme if
Nobody verifies by default except 10
different staking pools then all that
you need to try to force a change to the
rules that the users might not like is
tense taking polls to come together and
agree on it but if on the other hand you
have 10 000 users where the way that
those users interact with the Chain by
default is they verify it locally and we
accept blocks if they see those blocks
as being valid if someone wants to try
to push some change to the rules they
actually have someone go to the user so
they have to convince the entire set of
users to go along with that that's a
much higher bar let's say that I'm
Solana Solana is a super high throughput
blockchain has much higher Hardware
requirements than what ethereum has if I
were a Solana proponent I might say look
ethereum has 5 000 some odd nodes
something in that ballpark Solana might
have let's say for a second argument one
tenth the number of nodes to actually
get everybody in Solana to somehow fail
to notice that there's been some
fundamental failure or safety violation
within Solana would be very difficult
yes it's one-tenth the number of nodes
in ethereum but ethereum just has some
number of nodes Solana has some number
of nodes they're all pretty large and
they're all large enough communities
that they would notice if something were
to go wrong what is your counter
argument to the Solana Advocate who says
look it's consumer Hardware it's
expensive consumer Hardware but it's
still consumer hardware and somebody
sufficiently motivated can still go out
and verify salon on transactions in the
way that I think about this is it's not
just about what is the level of
technical capability of running a notice
once it gets to the point where running
a node is so easy that people are
comfortable doing it by default right if
running a node is hard but possible that
there just is this constant pressure to
try to save time and point yourself to
another node potentially even some of
the people participating in the upper
mistake instance are going to start
pointing to the same node I think that
actually happens in EOS a couple of
years back right now doesn't the Solana
Foundation even have to explicitly do a
whole bunch of work to actively
encourage people to run nodes all these
nuclear ones have a lot of subsidies
that go out to most of the node
providers right so the question is when
the subsidies disappear is the network
still going to work that way there's
actually two aspects here that's one
aspect is the technical feasibility and
Technical feasibility is is running a
node easy enough that people are going
to keep doing it as a hobby even with
ethereum there's a lot that we could do
to make running a node even easier than
it is today and a lot of the scaling
things that we're doing in a lot of the
protocol changes that we're doing over
the next couple of years aren't trying
to be in that direction for example
there's this feature called stateless
clients the goal of sales clients is
that it becomes possible to verify the
chain without having more than a very
tiny amount of information on your hard
drive right now in ethereum node it
takes up half my hard drive after sales
clients it's not going to take up any of
my hard drive Bitcoin is in a very good
place already from a node running is
point of view Bitcoin is in a better
place than ethereum but Bitcoin does
obviously Sacrifice by having
significantly lower throughput than
ethereum does so technical feasibility
is one aspect another important aspect
is culture people need to feel like it
is this very ingrained responsibility
that there's lots of this very
independent verification going on and
that's something that is difficult to
cultivate it is one of those things
where if you lose it it is fairly
difficult to try to get it back and I do
think Bitcoin has that I do think that
in ethereum with the staking culture
it's actually been improving recently
and I wanted to keep improving but it is
the sort of thing that needs to be
highly valued the two things play into
each other if you have a culture that
values running nodes then you have a
culture that's going to Value making
protocol changes to make it easier to
run a node and if it's possible to run a
node just technically speaking then it's
more likely that you're going to have
that kind of culture people sometimes
ask us hey why not crank up the
parameters by a factor of five and why
not require people to have 10 terabyte
hard drives and a lot of people in
ethereum core developments are actively
resisting this so I think it's only
ethereum and Bitcoin almost that have
cultures that are rolling to actively
make sacrifices for decentralization to
that same extent I've always taken the
point of view at the most decentralized
coins will win in the end because the
whole point of blockchain is
decentralization otherwise you wouldn't
need them in the first place that said
it does seem that every wave that
happens in crypto where new users come
in and there's a boom in a bull market
the new users tend to go for minimum
viable decentralization they don't care
about decentralization until the
bogeyman shows up and starts stomping
them out of existence even decentralized
finance a lot of these are decentralized
in name only they're running centralized
front ends the teams are in well-known
locations they're probably feeling the
how we test on some level or another and
we're going to find out just how far
governments are going to go to test the
decentralization metric but privacy is
the same people don't value privacy
until somebody goes to jail over it and
then they're like oh wait I want privacy
or someone gets the platform right now
we're in a bull market phase and when
the risks aren't as high people sort of
ignore decentralization and privacy but
after a couple of incidents you will see
people start paying attention to
decentralization and privacy and at some
level the ogs know this because the most
money is still locked up in Bitcoin
Neath and some of that is momentum but
some of that is also security you can
put money into Bitcoin Ethan forget
about it for a long time I'm not
convinced you can do that and a lot of
the other protocols that are not
completely decentralized privacy
everyone just seems to be ignoring for
now well tornado cash exists do you see
tornado cash in ethereum staying at a
separate layer or separate application
or do you ever see it being folded into
ethereum at a core level the realistic
way it'll stay at a separate layer
because if the rem's philosophy in
general is to try to be simple at the
base and for a lot of the extra features
to be something that gets built on top
there is a lot of other blockchains that
take different philosophies once again
and EOS their default wallet type has
social recovery in it or something like
that you got to update your references I
feel like I feel dirty just talking
about that chain
we should get into social recovery
social recovery is a really interesting
concept the basic idea is that your
wallet because now you have to be your
own bank if you really want to be a
crypto head it's scary so some of us
have to trust third-party custodians but
then you're back into normal banking so
if you want to maintain it yourself then
social recovery wallets are where you
can share your wallet with your friends
or family or other trusted people so
that when you need to recover it it
takes two out of three or three out of
five or whatever keys and Bitcoin is
native support for this eth now has
products diagnosis safe and others that
lend support to this so the wallets are
getting better security is getting
better we didn't talk about the whole
ecosystem which is interesting we were
talking about scalability the point I
got was that eth is a decentralization
culture it's going to go for
decentralization first which actually
makes it attractive for high value
applications like decentralized Finance
if you're trading a ten thousand dollar
trade you'll pay the fifty dollars in
fees for the security by the way one
thing that we didn't talk about is that
a block chain runs a market for Block
space there's limited block space
because there's limited computing power
so you're always participating in
auction and you're paying to get your
execution of your application included
in the current run of the blockchain and
so to do that you're buying block space
and ethereum block space has gotten
quite expensive so things like sharding
and adding these things called rollups
on layer 2 which we haven't talked about
these are ways of creating more block
space Bringing Down the cost of blocks
but even if ethereum stays very
expensive then the high value
applications will stay on ethereum those
people will just pay more if you're
building Wall Street you want rule of
law you want equal protection under the
law you want property right so you pay
for that whereas if you're just building
a game and you're trading magic axes and
swords and they're worth a couple of
dollars each maybe you just go to a
blockchain that doesn't value
decentralization as much so perhaps the
applications break down that way but one
of the things we haven't talked about is
this incredible ecosystem of all these
people building on it and around it and
my personal view is that if got saved if
you look at Bitcoin there's not been a
lot of innovation in Bitcoin sure the
core developers have done some good work
but now the meme in Bitcoin is no no we
don't change anything because we're
trying to be the reserve currency here
we're trying to be digital gold so we
don't want to change anything everything
is fixed Immaculate Conception it was
mostly right at the beginning we made a
few tweaks it's good to go we'll fix a
few little things but you can rely on
this because it doesn't need to change
it already does a job and it does it
well and I kind of buy that argument but
I don't buy the Maximus argument that
that is the end goal of all blockchains
there are other blockchain things you
can do and in eth we're doing a lot more
than just that but even there I noticed
that there's an incentive mechanism
around coins when you create a
blockchain you create these coins to
regulate access to the network now in a
theory you reward the people who are
doing the hard work around the
blockchain so you reward the miners who
are securing the blockchain or the
stakers were securing the blockchain and
it's been hard to reward the Developers
I know Z cash had a Founder's reward
which was controversial Satoshi has five
percent of the Bitcoin blockchain the Z
cash founders award is like 10 of the
blockchain some of the modern
blockchains 70 80 90 99 is going to the
initial teams and investors and these
are the VC chains so how do you incent
people to build on somebody else's
blockchain because the incentive is
becoming well that's a great blockchain
you got there it's open source let me
Fork it let me make a copy of it and run
it myself or I've seen game developers
who are saying I don't need Solana level
security I'll just Fork an existing
blockchain just make it my own and my
own users who are running the game will
also run the blockchain so the
incentives aren't there for developers
to build on somebody else's blockchain I
got in trouble for saying this in 2017
but I still stand by it there's a free
writer effect on blockchains there's a
strong incentive to Fork a chain and
build your own rather than to build on
existing chain there's a couple of
brilliant things that maybe by accident
maybe deliberately happen on Eve that
have been allowed an ecosystem of
innovation on each there's erc20 which
is people are building their own tokens
and then there's these roll ups and
layers where people are building on top
of eth and in theory they're going to
issue their own token so I would argue
that the one place where the eth
innovation has been the slowest and
maybe because it's technically the
hardest has been at your own layer it's
been at layer one where the E Foundation
is working where the sharding is
supposed to take place and where eth2 is
supposed to get built that's where the
schedule has been the furthest behind
whereas on Roll-Ups on layer 2 things
are moving very very fast on erc20 other
assets built on top of eth things are
moving very very fast and I wonder if
it's just as simple as incentives have
you thought about how do I incent the
people working at layer one to move fast
maybe if they got their own token
somehow the ethereum foundation does
have like a bunch of Youth and it uses
used to pay people working on lawyer one
a few months ago we announced a client
developer reward where basically every
one of the teams that's building a piece
of software that understands and talks
to the ethereum product colon can run a
node he gets some amounts of eth that
was in the form of eth that's locked up
in the proof of stake system that is not
fully connected to the rest of ethereum
yet so ethereum has to have fully
switched over to proof of stake in order
for them to be able to withdraw that
money so that kind of incentive exists
it's not even so much about incentives
the application lawyer in the lawyer 2
has been faster because building at
those layers is provisionless you don't
have to coordinate with anyone to build
a layer two you don't have to coordinate
with anyone to build an application
whereas if he wants to change the
ethereum protocol that's one of the most
permission things out there you have to
just get lots of people to agree have to
get an entire Community to buy into a
protocol change for the ethereum lawyer
once here's an interesting question
imagine we've froze layer one today you
could make some all changes like the
Bitcoin folks do but you couldn't make
big changes but the layer 2 people
continue innovating permissionlessly
they keep building all their rollups and
all associated analogies but you're
still on proof of work you're still not
sharded at layer one could eat still
work could layer 2 carry it along for a
while it could I don't think people
would be happy about it because people
in ethereum do a lot of proof of stake
and want to get over to it quickly just
to give some concrete numbers today
ethereum is on average Due about 15 to
20 transactions a second but if we just
move to layer two then we could go up to
about 5 000 transactions a second you
keep the same blockchain but instead of
using the blockchain directly you use
these extra protocols that package up
the information and use the blockchain
in different ways so that you're still
doing the same stuff you're still
getting the same security guarantees but
you're using the blockchain more
efficiently there's more compression and
more of the computation is being done
off chain through other protocols so
there is 100 x improvements that can't
happen with layer 2 is done well that
has not happened yet now Layer Two as
they exist today they're very far from
perfect instead of 100x gain they might
only be 10x gain or even a bit less at
the moment but a roll-up technology is
improving all of these things are
improving so so if layer 1 did not
change if all we could do was just the
more earlier twos so we could get up to
5 000 transactions a second that would
definitely be a pretty good ethereum
already that layer 2 execution is code
what about the data does the data still
all have to stay on the layer 1
blockchain
the way that Roll-Ups work is that they
do the code execution option so there
are these cryptographic protocols where
the execution gets done off chain and
then verified on chain and the verifying
is much faster than the original
computation and then the data has to be
on chain but the data can be on chain in
a very compressed form instead of
putting transactions on chain you put
like a zip file of the transactions on
chain it's like doing a data for
computation trade-off you have less data
but then you have to do more computation
but we're okay with doing more
computation because we could do more
computation really efficiently off chain
if you do a roll up super efficiently
then you only need to put about 16 bytes
on chain per transaction today on
average transactions are like 100 to 200
bytes so 16 bytes on chain and then
decompression verification computation
happens off chain everything happens off
chain except for this tiny amount of
data that's where the efficiency comes
from a CB and your team recently did an
analysis is where you try to look at the
actual throughput on these different
smart contract chains but you didn't do
the decentralization part yet so
obviously it looks the worst because
it's the most decentralized let's also
talk about how much of that is because
this Legacy and how much of it is
because it just chose to be the most
decentralized to Vitalis Point usually
when people Benchmark blockchains they
tend to choose benchmarks that make them
look good that produce big numbers and
the most obvious way to do that is to
just Benchmark transfers especially with
a lot of these newer blockchains they
tend to Benchmark transfers that are
done in a test net or done in a devnet
environment where you can always get
crazy gigantic numbers that aren't
reflective of reality we'd seen so many
ridiculous claims being thrown around
about what kinds of throughput
blockchains could do then we thought
okay why don't we develop a clearly
objective Benchmark as a way to verify
what can these blockchains do when you
compare them apples to apples in terms
of a common type of transaction that all
blockchains do and the most common one
which is how almost all trading happens
today in blockchains is a uniswap style
am trade amm automated Market maker it's
a very simple mathematical way to trade
two assets most of these you can just
simulate by looking at the gas limit and
looking at the Block time and don't need
to do a whole lot others of them you
have to verify empirically because the
way the gas computer doesn't tell you
enough to verify whether the blockchain
could actually hit in production so what
we found is that ethereum can do about
10 trades per second cello can do about
25 avax can do about 30 but it has much
higher ceiling polygon can do about 50
and binance smart chain can do about 200
and then Solana which famously claims
that it can do in the thousands to tens
of thousands of transactions per second
Solana can do about 280. but part of the
reason why ethereum performance is where
it is is to vitalik's point earlier that
ethereum has enshrined a certain level
of decentralization this is important as
a norm as an institution that we make
sure that ethereum is accessible to
anybody on a laptop and most of these
newer blockchains haven't chosen that
they choose different points on the
decentralization performance spectrum
and my view is that it's totally
sensible to have blockchains that choose
a different point on that trade-off
curve it's really important to have
ethereum and to have Bitcoin which go
all the way to the left but it's
sensible that some people should have
blockchains that are tuned for different
trade-offs but within tuning to a
different trailer you better get really
high performance if you going to be not
very decentralized my point is if you're
going to make that big trade-off you'd
better be getting a lot of bang for the
buck when you're doing it not only that
but I think the high value applications
are going to end up on bitcoin and
ethereum in that case and the highest
value application is just money I'm
curious metallic if you think longer
term money is a use case of eth is eth
the token and eth the coin price a
byproduct of something you need to run
the network or is it itself a core value
that each should be a store of value it
should be a place where people can put
their money in and forget about it for
10 years
ultimately that's a question for the
community to decide and I think over
time the community is more and more
deciding yes Eve is an important asset
and you can use if as a store of value
you can use youth as a money you can use
if to make transactions because
ultimately it is a cryptocurrency it's a
cryptocurrency whose value is in some
ways supported and backed by all of the
activity that's happening on the
ethereum chain with eip1559 like up the
big portion of the transaction fee from
every transaction which is paid and Eve
has to get burned once we have proof of
stake it's projected that we'll even
have negative issuance so if is sort of
positions to be fairly unique in that
way but to me it's not an either or if
the asset and ethereum the application
where your ecosystem are synergistic
with each other the stronger the
application where your ecosystem is the
stronger eth is and the stronger ethos
as an asset the stronger the application
away or ecosystem
people often compare Bitcoin to gold or
to the dollar as a store of value but
the biggest stores the value in the
world are not Bitcoin and gold they're
factories stocks houses real estate
actual productive assets oil is another
one Commodities Etc people store value
in all kinds of weird places art nfts so
it's absolutely possible that there will
be multiple stores of value if anything
what's more decentralized than having
dozens of viable coins that you can
store in running thousands or tens of
thousands or millions of assets that you
can store and that's true
decentralization so you don't have a
point of view on it you're just like
whatever the community wants that makes
the network run but isn't there
attention between trying to be welcoming
to newcomers and new applications and
highly scalable and letting everyone use
your network and constantly innovating
and changing and trying new things
versus preserving the value for the
people who are already there and
preserving the value that's already been
built there's an inherent tension there
there's definitely some tension one of
the big benefits so the ethereum
ecosystem the Sawyer II aspects to it
the pluralist aspects the way in which
the ecosystem has many sub-ecosystems is
that it is in many cases able to satisfy
both but if all you want to do is you
want to have your Ethan you want to hold
your Ethan we can do that and there's
even some ethereum applications that
value stability almost as much as
ethereum itself does maker down might be
one good example there awry might be
another good example there are some of
the algorithmic stable coins but then if
you want to go and do wild crazy stuff
then ethereum lets you do wild crazy
stuff too and if you need more
scalability to do wild crazy stuff then
you can go do the wild crazy stuff on a
roll-up so ethereum as an ecosystem does
try hard to have a place for many
different kinds of participants in that
way which is definitely something that's
hard to accomplish a lot of the other
blockchains either you adjust to the
digital rock or you're just a platform
but there is that the digital rock that
keeps the whole thing solid in ethereum
we do value solving the problem of both
having the ecosystem that can do a lot
of stuff and having the digital Rock in
the middle to keep it solid whether or
not we'll succeed is of course up to the
next decade of world history to decide
