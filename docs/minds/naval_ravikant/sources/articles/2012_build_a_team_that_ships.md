## Article Content

Naval shares insights from his startup experience on building an effective team at AngelList.

### Key Principles

- Keep the team small and focused
- Only hire "doers"
- No middle management
- Outsource non-core activities
- Let people choose their work
- Ship something every week

### Specific Practices

> "People choose what to work on. Better they ship what they want than not ship what you want."

**Team Structure:**
- Limit project tasks to one week maximum
- Use peer management through weekly commitments
- One person is accountable per project

**Weekly Shipping Protocol:**
- No tasks longer than one week
- You have to ship something into live production every week
- People promise what they'll do in the coming week on internal Yammer
- Deliver or publicly break your promise next week

### Team Evaluation

- If team members can't ship, they should be released
- Recognize that not every environment suits every person

### Candid Assessment

Naval acknowledges imperfections:
- Shipping half-baked features
- Challenges integrating non-engineers
- Core focus remains: "But, we ship."

The approach emphasizes rapid iteration, personal accountability, and continuous delivery over perfect planning.

### Philosophy

Naval wanted a team of self-managing people who ship code, keeping the team small with:
- All doers, no talkers
- Absolutely no middle managers
- Maximum autonomy and accountability
