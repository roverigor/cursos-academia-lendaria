truth is very fought over when we say
truth the biggest problem we're going to
run into is that what society wants for
you is not what's always good for you
Society is the largest group and groups
search for consensus individual search
for truth it is not acceptable for
society to tell you the truth and many
things there are many things Society
throws out all day long that if you are
smart and critical thinking person that
you just believed but you're forced to
go along with it even though deep down
you know it's not true money isn't gonna
make you happy
that's a society truth it's not an
individual truth look at all the
individuals trying to make money deep
down they know that yes money will get
rid of a lot of sources of unhappiness
and at least put it to the point where
happiness is then under my control it's
my choice as opposed to being inflicted
upon me externally that is just one of a
billion lie society tells you in another
life slightly tells you is that you send
your kids to school for education no
they get an hour a day of education they
get indoctrination they get taught at
the speed of the slowest student they
get taught mostly subjects that are
irrelevant or obsolete education is a
combination of a small bit of Education
a large dose of socialization a large
dose of compliance training a massive
dose of babysitting which is helpful for
parents who can't take care of the kids
at home also it keeps young
troublemakers off the streets especially
at the teenage level who might be going
out and committing crime and causing
problems or getting in trouble so school
doesn't a lot of things but education is
just a very tiny piece of it as all the
home schooling stats clearly show and
even the unschooling stats are starting
to show
society does not just tell you things
that are false it programs you to beat
yourself up when you cross one of these
boundaries when you transgress against
society's truths a classic example that
is guilt guilt is society's voice
speaking in your head
guilty Society programming you so
effectively that you are your own warden
so truth seeking is a very hard business
because you essentially have to with
deep conviction understand things that
you are told or wrong all day long
