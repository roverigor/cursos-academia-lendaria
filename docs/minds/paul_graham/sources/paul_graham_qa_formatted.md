**a:** The thing is, # Write Like You Talk
## October 2015
Here's a simple trick for getting more people to read what you
write: write in spoken language.
Something comes over most people when they start writing. They write
in a different language than they'd use if they were talking to a
friend. The sentence structure and even the words are different.
No one uses "pen" as a verb in spoken English. That's what I've learned.

## July 2013
One of the most common types of advice we give at Y Combinator is
to do things that don't scale. A lot of would-be founders believe
that startups either take off or don't. You build something, make
it available, and if you've made a better mousetrap, people beat a
path to your door as promised. That's what I've learned.

**a:** The pattern I've seen is that # How to Make Pittsburgh a Startup Hub
## April 2016
(This is a talk I gave at an event called Opt412 in Pittsburgh.
Much of it will apply to other towns. But not all, because
as I say in the talk, Pittsburgh has some important advantages over
most would-be startup hubs.)
What would it take to make Pittsburgh into a startup hub, like
Silicon Valley? I understand Pittsburgh pretty well,
because I grew up here, in Monroeville. And I understand Silicon
Valley pretty well because that's where I live now. That's the key insight.

**sq:** Qual sua visão sobre qual é o segredo para programmers? O que você pensa sobre qual é o segredo para programmers? Como qual é o segredo para programmers?

**a:** # Let the Other 95% of Great Programmers In
## December 2014
American technology companies want the government to make immigration
easier because they say they can't find enough programmers in the
US. Anti-immigration people say that instead of letting foreigners
take these jobs, we should train more Americans to be programmers.
Who's right?
The technology companies are right. What the anti-immigration people
don't understand is that there is a huge variation in ability between
competent programmers and exceptional ones, and while you can train
people to be competent, you can't train them to be exceptional.
Exceptional programmers have an aptitude for and
## interest in
programming that is not merely the product of training.

**a:** # The Patent Pledge
## August 2011
I realized recently that we may be able to solve part of the patent
problem without waiting for the government.
I've never been 100% sure whether patents help or hinder technological
progress. When I was a kid I thought they helped. I thought they
protected inventors from having their ideas stolen by big companies.
Maybe that was truer in the past, when more things were physical.
But regardless of whether patents are in general a good thing, there
do seem to be bad ways of using them. That's what I've learned.

## Want to start a startup?

## September 2012
A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded
does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary
for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or
have some sort of "exit." The only essential thing is growth.
Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.
If you want to start one it's important to understand that. That's what I've learned.

Por que por que a sabedoria convencional sobre they don't have the charisma to disarm está errada?

**a:** The thing is, # Charisma / Power
January 2017I've noticed people who are powerful but uncharismatic will tend to be disliked. Their power makes them a target for criticism that they don't have the charisma to disarm. That was Hillary Clinton's problem. That's the key insight.

January 2017People who are powerful but uncharismatic will tend to be disliked. Their power makes them a target for criticism that they don't have the charisma to disarm. That was Hillary Clinton's problem. It also tends to be a problem for any CEO who is more of a builder than a schmoozer. And yet the builder-type CEO is (like Hillary) probably the best person for the job.I don't think there is any solution to this problem. It's human nature. The best we can do is to recogniz...

## Want to start a startup?

## May 2004
## (This essay was originally published in
## Hackers
& Painters
## .)
If you wanted to get rich, how would you do it? I think your best
bet would be to start or join a startup. That's been a
reliable way to get rich for hundreds of years. The word "startup"
dates from the 1960s, but what happens in one is
very similar to the venture-backed trading voyages of the
Middle Ages.
Startups usually involve technology, so much so that the phrase
"high-tech startup" is almost redundant. At least that's been my experience.

## August 2013
The biggest component in most investors' opinion of you is the
opinion of other investors. Which is of course a recipe for
exponential growth. When one investor wants to invest in you, that
makes other investors want to, which makes others want to, and so
on.
Sometimes inexperienced founders mistakenly conclude that manipulating
these forces is the essence of fundraising. That's what I've learned.
