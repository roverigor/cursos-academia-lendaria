# CRITICAL FINDINGS
# ========================================

critical_findings:
  - finding: "1989 Kidnapping as Defining Trauma"
    impact: "CRITICAL"
    details: |
      December 11, 1989, 6-7 days underground, 3m² crate, $30M ransom. PTSD
      ("strange noises"), therapy-informed recovery. Identified as one of "3
      Breaking Points". Transformed authoritarian/stressed leader → balanced/
      teaching-focused. ENTIRE Leadership 360° methodology emerges from this trauma.

  - finding: "75-Year Continuous Fitness (Age 12-87)"
    impact: "HIGH"
    details: |
      NOT a late-life adoption. Started boxing age 12 (bullied, chubby). Continuous
      training 75 years. Triathlon competitor 70s-80s. Running backward on treadmill
      at 77. Died age 87 (pneumonia, NOT lifestyle disease). Pioneered employee gyms
      Brazil 1980s. Fitness = life discipline, not hobby.

  - finding: "Multiple Reinventions Without Retirement"
    impact: "HIGH"
    details: |
      Never retired. Age 12-87 continuous work. Reinventions: Founder (1959) →
      CEO (1968) → Kidnapping survivor (1989) → Turnaround specialist (1990) →
      Investor (2005) → BRF Chairman (2013) → Educator (2010-2024) → CNN host
      (2022-2024). 75 years continuous evolution.

  - finding: "BRF Failure as Resilience Demonstration"
    impact: "MEDIUM"
    details: |
      BRF (2013-2018): Started well (R$ 700M → R$ 2.2B profit), then R$ 1.1B loss,
      market cap halved, forced exit. Public failure at age 82. Response: "Despedida
      é apenas um até logo" (It's just a see you later). Demonstrates resilience
      teaching is lived, not just preached.
