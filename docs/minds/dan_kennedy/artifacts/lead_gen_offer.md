in the mail. 99% of marketers do not take this approach at all. It's extra work & digital delivery is so much more automated. Of course, there's a strategy behind the physical gift. Dan loves sending people big packages in the mail & making them feel like it's Christmas. We love getting packages in the mail & we love unwrapping gifts. This even applies to the cheap booklets & binders Dan sends out. So, not only does Dan stand out with this offer, he also creates this unique experience that actually makes the person get much more excited than an online video or PDF. The second thing that makes this offer different is the amount of value & items Dan packs on. The visual he includes demonstrates the enormity of it. Just like Bob Stupak's Vegas Offer:

, the detailed mention of everything included just sounds like a LOT which is exactly what they want. There's a reason why he calls it the "Most Incredible Free Gift Ever".

Key Takeaways
When it comes to your front-end offer, think outside the box. Dan actually sends you a physical package. Try other formats & ways of delivering value that can help you stand out from the rest of your market.
Always focus on bumping up your "perceived value". Your perceived value is what really counts. Not the actual physical value. The lower the physical value & higher the perceived value the better.
