headed towards failure if they don't take up his offers. For another example of this, check out our last email example from Dan:
http://swiped.co/file/followup-dankennedy/
In this email, Dan grabs you're attention by getting the person to wonder why it wouldn't be for them. What makes them different? From there, as mentioned above, he takes the subject & flips it into "this probably isn't for you if you're like all the others who follow typical advice, getting mediocre results at best." This type of messaging creates several desirable effects. First, he's separating himself from other gurus by telling the subscriber that most aren't doing it right (even mentioning that it's better to do the complete opposite which is a bold statement). Second, he makes the person want to associate with the group that "gets it". By correlating his offer to that belonging, he hooks in the person even more, tying their identity to their purchase decision.

Key Takeaways
Like Dan, you can use takeaway selling in conjunction with making the person feel like they don't have to buy, but then they'll end up being a part of a group that isn't as good/smart/successful. By tying their identity & sense of belonging to their purchasing decision, you create a much more powerful pitch.
