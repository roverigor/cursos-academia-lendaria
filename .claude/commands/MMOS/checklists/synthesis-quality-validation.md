**Methodology:** Munger Latticework Standards

## ⚠️ MUNGER'S WARNING

**"You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and in life. You've got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head."**

This checklist ensures frameworks form a **latticework** (interconnected knowledge web), not a **list** (isolated facts).

---

## Section 1: Framework Extraction Quality ✅

### 1.1 Pattern Hunting Rigor
- [ ] Minimum 8 distinct frameworks extracted
- [ ] Each framework has 3+ documented usage examples
- [ ] Frameworks span multiple types (cause-effect, decision, constraint, optimization, pattern, heuristic)
- [ ] Not just listing known models (First-Principles, 80/20) but EXTRACTING mind's actual frameworks

### 1.2 Evidence Quality
For each framework:
- [ ] Frequency documented (constant/high/medium)
- [ ] Source count >= 3 (triangulation)
- [ ] Specific usage contexts captured
- [ ] Real examples from source material cited

### 1.3 Framework Type Distribution
- [ ] Balanced across types (not all one type)
- [ ] Cause-effect frameworks: 1-3
- [ ] Decision frameworks: 2-4
- [ ] Constraint frameworks: 1-2
- [ ] Optimization frameworks: 1-2
- [ ] Pattern-recognition frameworks: 1-2
- [ ] Heuristics: 2-3

---

## Section 2: Cross-Domain Validation (Munger's Acid Test) ✅

### 2.1 Multi-Domain Testing
For EACH framework:
- [ ] Original domain identified
- [ ] Tested in at least 2 additional domains
- [ ] Domain translation examples documented
- [ ] Applicability score calculated (0-1.0)

### 2.2 Boundary Conditions
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** "When it works" contexts defined
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** "When it fails" contexts defined
- [ ] Failure modes documented
- [ ] Limitations explicitly stated

### 2.3 Cross-Domain Champions
- [ ] Identified frameworks that work in 3+ domains
- [ ] Universal principles extracted from champions
- [ ] Narrow frameworks flagged as context-specific

❌ **Reject if:** Any framework only validated in single domain
✅ **Accept if:** All frameworks tested across 2+ domains with boundary conditions

---

## Section 3: First-Principles Decomposition ✅

### 3.1 Atomic Axiom Extraction
For each framework:
- [ ] Reduced to 3-5 core axioms (irreducible truths)
- [ ] Necessary conditions listed (what must be true)
- [ ] Domain-specific language removed (abstracted)
- [ ] Logical structure documented (how axioms connect)

### 3.2 Inversion Test (Munger's Favorite)
For each framework:
- [ ] Inversion question asked: "How would this fail catastrophically?"
- [ ] Failure modes identified
- [ ] Critical dependencies exposed
- [ ] False assumptions flagged

**Example Quality Check:**
```
Good Inversion:
Framework: Circle of Competence
Inversion: What happens if you ignore boundaries?
→ Overconfidence, expert errors outside domain, Dunning-Kruger

Bad Inversion:
Framework: Circle of Competence
Inversion: What if you stay inside circle?
→ This doesn't invert the framework, it's just restating it
```

- [ ] All inversions are true inversions (not restatements)

---

## Section 4: Latticework Construction (NOT A LIST!) ✅

### 4.1 Interconnection Mapping
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Frameworks are CONNECTED not isolated
- [ ] Complementary pairs identified (frameworks that enhance each other)
- [ ] Contradictions documented (frameworks that conflict)
- [ ] Sequential dependencies mapped (what must be learned first)
- [ ] Domain bridges identified (frameworks connecting disparate fields)

### 4.2 Latticework Density
- [ ] Minimum 2 connections per framework (nodes can't be isolated)
- [ ] Latticework map created (visual or structured representation)
- [ ] Edges documented with relationship types
- [ ] Network density score calculated

**Latticework Density Formula:**
```
Density = (Actual Edges) / (Possible Edges)
Minimum acceptable: 0.3 (30% of possible connections)
Good: 0.4-0.6
Excellent: 0.6+
```

- [ ] Latticework density >= 0.3

### 4.3 Lollapalooza Effects
- [ ] Identified framework combinations that compound (1+1+1 = 10 not 3)
- [ ] Documented why combinations create extreme outcomes
- [ ] Examples of lollapalooza effects in action

**Munger Example:**
```
Lollapalooza: Social proof + Authority + Incentive + Commitment
Context: Investment bubbles
Effect: 4 biases together create 100x overvaluation (not 4x)
```

- [ ] Minimum 2 lollapalooza combinations identified

---

## Section 5: Usability Validation ✅

### 5.1 Prediction Test
For each framework:
- [ ] Novel scenario defined (not from source data)
- [ ] Prediction made using framework
- [ ] Real-world validation attempted
- [ ] Result: PASS (framework predicted correctly) or FAIL

**Minimum Standard:** 70% of frameworks pass prediction test

### 5.2 Explanation Test
For each framework:
- [ ] Identifies previously mysterious pattern it explains
- [ ] Explanation documented
- [ ] Explanatory power rated (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

**Minimum Standard:** 60% of frameworks have HIGH explanatory power

### 5.3 Action Guidance Test
For each framework:
- [ ] Situation where framework applies
- [ ] Non-obvious action recommended
- [ ] Counter-intuitiveness assessed

**Quality Indicator:** If framework only suggests obvious actions, it's common sense not insight

### 5.4 Error Prevention Test
For each framework:
- [ ] Common failure mode it prevents
- [ ] Prevention mechanism documented
- [ ] Effectiveness rated (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

### 5.5 Overall Usability Scores
- [ ] Each framework scored on 4 dimensions (prediction/explanation/action/error prevention)
- [ ] Average usability across all frameworks calculated
- [ ] Low-usability frameworks flagged for removal or refinement

**Minimum Standard:** Average usability score >= 3.0 / 4.0

## Section 7: Munger Quality Gates ✅

### 7.1 Gate 1: Latticework vs List
- [ ] **PASS:** Frameworks interconnected with documented relationships
- [ ] **FAIL:** Frameworks isolated without connections

**Critical:** This is the PRIMARY gate - if this fails, entire synthesis fails

### 7.2 Gate 2: First-Principles Decomposition
- [ ] **PASS:** All frameworks reduced to atomic axioms
- [ ] **FAIL:** Frameworks accepted at face value without decomposition

### 7.3 Gate 3: Cross-Domain Validation
- [ ] **PASS:** All frameworks tested in 2+ domains
- [ ] **FAIL:** Single-domain frameworks present

### 7.4 Gate 4: Predictive Power
- [ ] **PASS:** 70%+ frameworks generate correct predictions
- [ ] **FAIL:** Frameworks only describe, don't predict

### 7.5 Gate 5: Inversion Applied
- [ ] **PASS:** All frameworks tested via inversion (how would this fail?)
- [ ] **FAIL:** Inversion skipped or poorly applied

### 7.6 Gate 6: Context Boundaries Defined
- [ ] **PASS:** Every framework has "when it works" and "when it fails" documented
- [ ] **FAIL:** Boundary conditions missing

### 7.7 Gate 7: Lollapalooza Identified
- [ ] **PASS:** Framework combinations that compound documented
- [ ] **FAIL:** No analysis of multi-framework effects

### 7.8 Gate 8: Multi-Model Thinking
- [ ] **PASS:** Evidence of applying multiple frameworks to same problem
- [ ] **FAIL:** Single-lens analysis (only one framework per situation)

**Overall Gate Performance:**
- [ ] 8/8 gates passed = EXCELLENT
- [ ] 6-7/8 gates passed = GOOD (document gaps)
- [ ] 5/8 gates passed = ACCEPTABLE (flag for revision)
- [ ] <5/8 gates passed = FAIL (re-analyze required)

---

## Section 8: Cognitive Signature Validation ✅

## 🎯 Munger's Final Standard

*"In my whole life, I have known no wise people who didn't read all the time—none, zero. You'd be amazed at how much Warren [Buffett] reads—and at how much I read. My children laugh at me. They think I'm a book with a couple of legs sticking out."*

Translation: This synthesis should reveal a **reading mind** - someone who builds knowledge latticeworks, not isolated facts.

If this synthesis could be created without reading widely across disciplines, it FAILS Munger's standard.
