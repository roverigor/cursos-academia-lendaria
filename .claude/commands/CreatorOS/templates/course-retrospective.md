## 🌟 What Went Well (Keep Doing)

### **1. [Success Area 1]**
**What happened:**
[Describe the success - e.g., "Pre-creation research identified Course Buddy tactic that boosted completion"]

**Why it worked:**
[Root cause - e.g., "Followed research framework systematically, prioritized by impact"]

**Evidence:**
[Data/feedback - e.g., "Students with course buddy had 76% completion vs. 12% solo"]

**Replicate how:**
[Action for next course - e.g., "Always include Course Buddy section in README and Lesson 1.1"]

---

### **2. [Success Area 2]**
**What happened:**
[e.g., "Voice fidelity hit 92% by using instructor's real stories and phrases"]

**Why it worked:**
[e.g., "Interviewed instructor for 30 min, captured signature phrases, read lessons aloud"]

**Evidence:**
[e.g., "QA Report: 'Indistinguishable from instructor's natural style'"]

**Replicate how:**
[e.g., "Always record instructor interview pre-creation, create phrase library"]

### **3. [Success Area 3]**

## 🔴 What Didn't Go Well (Stop Doing / Improve)

### **1. [Problem Area 1]**
**What happened:**
[Describe the issue - e.g., "Mid-creation research skipped due to time pressure, missed tool update"]

**Impact:**
[Consequence - e.g., "Had to rewrite Lesson 2.1 after launch when Bolt UI changed"]

**Root cause:**
[Why it happened - e.g., "Didn't block calendar time for checkpoint, felt optional"]

**Fix for next time:**
[Preventive action - e.g., "Make mid-creation checkpoint mandatory, block 30-min calendar"]

**Owner:**
[Who will ensure this happens - e.g., "PO"]

---

### **2. [Problem Area 2]**
**What happened:**
[e.g., "QA found 12 medium issues because technical validation happened too late"]

**Impact:**
[e.g., "Added 3 hours of rework, delayed launch by 2 days"]

**Root cause:**
[e.g., "Wrote all content before testing any code snippets"]

**Fix for next time:**
[e.g., "Test all code as you write each lesson, don't batch testing"]

**Owner:**
[e.g., "Course Creator"]

## 💡 Ideas to Try (Start Doing)

### **1. [New Idea 1]**
**Idea:**
[e.g., "Create video walkthroughs for complex lessons, not just text"]

**Why try this:**
[Rationale - e.g., "Students report getting stuck on Bolt UI, video would show exactly what to click"]

**Effort estimate:**
[e.g., "30 min per video, ~2 hours total for 4 videos"]

**Expected impact:**
[e.g., "Reduce support questions by 50%, increase completion by 10%"]

**Try in:**
[Next course or version - e.g., "Vibecoding V1.1 or next course"]

---

### **2. [New Idea 2]**
**Idea:**
[e.g., "Run live cohort instead of self-paced for V2"]

**Why try this:**
[e.g., "Research shows cohorts have 65% completion vs. 30% self-paced"]

**Effort estimate:**
[e.g., "2 hours/week for 2 weeks = 4 hours live time"]

**Expected impact:**
[e.g., "2x completion rate, enables premium pricing ($297 vs. $97)"]

**Try in:**
[e.g., "Q2 2025 cohort"]
