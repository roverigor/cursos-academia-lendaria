- [ ] Pedagogical review by instructional designer
- [ ] Legal review of disclaimers (GDPR, CCPA, ToS compliance)
- [ ] Accessibility check (screen readers, captions, etc.)

**After Launch:**
- [ ] Weekly "top 3 issues" review (fix immediately)

**Value Propositions:**
- "Cut prospecting time from 40 hrs/week to 5 hrs/week"
- "Learn tools used by top 1% of growth marketers"
- "ROI guarantee: Save 10x course cost or money back"
- "From zero to automated outreach in 4 weeks"

**Pricing Strategy:**
